Question:
A 72-year-old man with a history of symptomatic gallstones presents with acute right-sided abdominal pain, right-upper-quadrant tenderness, and leukocytosis. Initial management includes antibiotics and hydration, but the clinical picture does not improve over three days. A barium-enema examination reveals partial obstruction at the level of the right transverse colon with a segmental area of narrowing at the distal limb of the hepatic flexure. The mucosal folds are nodular and thickened but not ulcerated. Glucagon administration does not relieve the narrowing. The patient passes large volumes of liquid stools that are negative for occult blood. At operation, considerable distention of the small bowel is found with an area of apparent necrosis on its antimesenteric border adjacent to a pelvic abscess. The ascending colon is distended, and a mass in the right transverse colon encompasses the fundus of the gallbladder and is wrapped in omentum. A right colectomy is performed, removing a segment of small bowel from a point just proximal to the sealed perforation in the pelvis, with an end-to-end anastomosis of the ileum to the midtransverse colon. The fundus of the gallbladder is amputated with the specimen, and a cholecystotomy tube is inserted into its stump. Postoperatively, the patient initially improves but is readmitted two months later with fever, right-upper-quadrant pain, and elevated bilirubin. Ultrasound suggests a common-duct stone, but retrograde cholangiography reveals stenosis of the distal centimeter of the duct, treated by endoscopic papillotomy. What is the most likely etiology of the patient's readmission symptoms?

## Thinking

Alright, let's think about this. We've got a 72-year-old man who's been having some pretty rough times with his gallbladder and bowels. He's got a history of symptomatic gallstones, and now he's back with some serious right-sided abdominal pain and tenderness. That's not all; he's also got leukocytosis, which means his white blood cell count is up, suggesting some kind of infection or inflammation.

So, they start him on antibiotics and fluids, but it's not doing the trick. Hmm, that's concerning. They do a barium enema, and it shows a partial blockage in the right transverse colon. There's a narrowing at the hepatic flexure, and the mucosal folds are thickened but not ulcerated. That's interesting. They try glucagon, but it doesn't help, so it's not just a simple spasm.

He's passing a lot of liquid stools, and they're not seeing any blood in them, which is good, but it's still worrying. At surgery, they find his small bowel is really distended, and there's some necrosis near a pelvic abscess. The ascending colon is distended too, and there's a mass in the right transverse colon that's wrapped around the gallbladder. They do a right colectomy and remove a part of the small bowel, and they even take out the fundus of the gallbladder. They put in a cholecystostomy tube too.

After the surgery, he seems to get better at first, but then he's back in the hospital a couple of months later. This time, he's got a fever, pain in the right upper quadrant, and his bilirubin levels are up. That's a red flag for something going on with the bile ducts. They do an ultrasound and find a common-duct stone, but the retrograde cholangiography shows a narrowing at the end of the duct. They fix it with an endoscopic papillotomy.

So, what's going on here? The initial problem was a gallbladder issue, and it sounds like it led to a bowel obstruction. The surgery seemed to help, but now there's a new problem with the bile duct. It's like the gallbladder issue has caused a chain reaction. The mass that was around the gallbladder might have been pressing on the bile duct, causing a blockage. That's why the bilirubin levels are up, and he's got symptoms of cholangitis.

But wait, there's more. The surgery involved removing the gallbladder fundus and putting in a cholecystostomy tube. That could have caused some changes in the bile flow, maybe even a leak or some kind of injury to the bile duct. That could explain the narrowing and the stone. It's like the surgery didn't fix everything, and now there's a new problem.

So, putting it all together, the most likely reason for his readmission is that the surgery caused some kind of bile duct injury or stricture. The narrowing at the end of the duct is probably from the surgery, and that's why he's got these symptoms again. It's a bit of a domino effect, with the gallbladder issue leading to the bowel problem, and then the surgery causing the bile duct issue. That makes sense, right?

## Final Response

The most likely etiology of the patient's readmission symptoms is a bile duct injury or stricture caused by the surgical intervention. The initial surgery involved removing the gallbladder fundus and placing a cholecystostomy tube, which could have led to changes in bile flow, potentially causing a leak or injury to the bile duct. This could result in the narrowing observed in the distal centimeter of the bile duct, as seen on retrograde cholangiography. This narrowing is likely responsible for the patient's symptoms of fever, right-upper-quadrant pain, and elevated bilirubin levels upon readmission.
