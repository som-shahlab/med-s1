      "----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "*Dr. Raymond W. Redline:* May we see the EEG and imaging studies?*Dr. Kalpathy S. Krishnamoorthy:* A 24-hour bedside EEG, obtained when the baby was having multiple apneic events (see Figure 1 of the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP358161713DC1), available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org), shows runs of high-voltage sharp waves coming predominantly from the left temporal region, lasting for more than 10 seconds; this pattern is considered an EEG hallmark of seizure. Similar runs occurred almost every 5 to 10 minutes for the next 18 hours, which were consistent with frequent seizures. Many of these results were not correlated with any clinical evidence of seizure activity. Since the absence of a correlation between EEG and clinical findings is not uncommon, in difficult cases, continuous bedside EEG can be helpful in deciding on appropriate therapy.Because of the EEG evidence of seizures, the child was given anticonvulsant agents intravenously; after 6 to 8 hours, EEG evidence of seizure disappeared, indicating a response to treatment. A follow-up standard EEG obtained 3 days later was normal.*Dr. Pallavi Sagar:* CT scanning of the brain on the first hospital day without the administration of contrast material showed no evidence of hydrocephalus, intracranial hemorrhage, brain malformation, or mass lesion. However, a subtle hypodensity in the left temporal lobe ([Figure 1A](#f01)) raised concern about acute ischemic injury. The same day, an MRI study of the brain ([Figure 1B](#f01)) confirmed the presence of a wedge-shaped area of loss of differentiation between gray matter and white matter in the left temporal lobe corresponding to the abnormality on the CT scan of the brain, which was consistent with edema. Diffusion-weighted imaging ([Figure 1C](#f01)) showed restricted diffusion, with decreased apparent-diffusion-coefficient values ([Figure 1D](#f01)) suggestive of cytotoxic edema. These findings are consistent with acute arterial ischemic stroke in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery.*Dr. Mary Etta King:* The echocardiogram shows diffuse thickening of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve ([Figure 2A](#f02) and [Video 1](#v01)). In some views, there is a small, linear, prolapsing structure associated with the area of thickening ([Figure 2A](#f02) and [Video 2](#v01)). This may represent a fibrin strand, thrombus, or vegetation associated with the valve. There is a patent foramen ovale ([Figure 2B](#f02) and [Video 3](#v01)), as seen in nearly all newborns, with evidence of intermittent right-to-left shunting on color Doppler imaging ([Figure 2C](#f02) and [Video 4](#v01)). Since the pressures in the right side of the heart of a newborn are still somewhat high, there is the potential for right-to-left embolization through the patent foramen ovale.*Dr. Redline:* This 1-day-old infant had unexplained episodes of apnea after birth by cesarean section at 41 weeks 4 days' gestation. The birth was complicated by prolonged labor, artificial rupture of the membranes 17 hours before delivery, and a maternal temperature of 38.0°C. This presentation could result from a number of conditions.\n",
      "### Chorioamnionitis\n",
      "\n",
      "Long labor, a prolonged period between artificial rupture of the membranes and delivery, maternal fever, a high maternal white-cell count, and a ratio of immature to total neutrophils in the newborn that is at the upper limit of the normal range are suggestive, but not diagnostic, of chorioamnionitis in this case.[1](#core-r001) Chorioamnionitis is an infection of the placental membranes usually caused by organisms spreading to the uterus from the lower genital tract. The clinical diagnosis of chorioamnionitis has high false negative and false positive rates as compared with the gold standard, placental histopathological diagnosis.[2](#core-r002)\n",
      "### Apneic Spells\n",
      "\n",
      "Apneic spells, defined as cessation of respirations for 15 to 20 seconds or more in the first 6 months of life, are frequently associated with oxygen desaturation and reflex bradycardia.[3](#core-r003) In preterm infants, the normal stimulation of respiratory drive triggered by transient arterial hypoxia and increased hypercapnia is commonly delayed, and prolonged periods of apnea can occur in the absence of a specific cause. In term infants, such as this one, apneic spells are usually observed in association with other abnormalities. Causes of apneic spells originating outside the central nervous system (CNS) include sepsis, genetic metabolic disorders, congenital heart disease, gastroesophageal reflux, and poor pharyngeal coordination. Causes that originate within the CNS include hypoventilation syndromes, parenchymal lesions, and seizures. In this patient, seizures were documented by EEG and were responsible for the episodes of bradypnea and apnea.\n",
      "### Neonatal Seizures\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike seizures in later life, neonatal seizures are often brief and subtle.[4](#core-r004) They usually require EEG confirmation and have a distinct spectrum of eliciting factors. Causes of neonatal seizure not associated with the CNS include drug withdrawal, electrolyte imbalance, pyridoxine deficiency, and genetic–metabolic disorders. In this case, there was no history of maternal substance abuse or positive results of drug testing. Serum sodium, calcium, and glucose levels were normal, and the seizures responded to medication without pyridoxine supplementation. The list of inborn errors of metabolism associated with neonatal seizures is long. Most are characterized by hypotonia, lethargy, coma, or ataxia rather than the hypertonia and normal consciousness in this patient. Furthermore, localization of seizures to the left temporal lobe of the brain, normal screening laboratory values, a negative family history, and the absence of extra-CNS manifestations make these diagnoses unlikely.Causes of seizures arising within the CNS include hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, maldevelopment of the CNS, and cerebrovascular lesions. This infant's Apgar scores were normal, and there were no signs or symptoms of neonatal encephalopathy, ruling out a hypoxic–ischemic event. Cerebrovascular lesions can affect veins or arteries. Venous lesions include sinus venous thrombosis, hemorrhagic infarction, and malformations. Arterial lesions include strokes due to occlusion of large or small arteries and global cerebral hypoperfusion, causing necrosis of tissue at the periphery of arterial vascular beds (known as watershed infarcts). Radiologic studies showed a lesion in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery, a finding consistent with perinatal arterial stroke.\n",
      "### Perinatal Ischemic Stroke\n",
      "\n",
      "The features of this case meet the defining criterion for perinatal ischemic stroke: focal disruption of cerebral blood flow due to arterial or venous thrombosis occurring between the 20th week of fetal life and the 28th postnatal day and confirmed by neuroimaging or neuropathological studies.[5](#core-r005) Neonatal stroke is the most common known cause of cerebral palsy in term infants such as this one. Although rare cases are caused by malformed or damaged blood vessels or infectious vasculitis,[6](#core-r006) these causes are especially uncommon in the early perinatal period and thus are unlikely in this case. The remaining cases are attributable to thromboembolic disease, the probable diagnosis here. Thromboembolic lesions most commonly affect the left middle cerebral artery, possibly reflecting a more direct route of spread to this artery through a patent foramen ovale than to other cerebral arteries. This patient had no obvious risk factors for thromboembolic disease, such as indwelling catheters or cardiac malformations. Among the multiple risk factors ([Table 2](#t02)), those most relevant to this case are fetal thrombophilia, neonatal infection, and thromboinflammatory disorders of the placenta.\n",
      "#### Fetal Thrombophilia\n",
      "\n",
      "As in adult and pediatric stroke, underlying thrombophilic disorders are important risk factors for perinatal stroke. The only maternal thrombophilias implicated in neonatal stroke are diseases associated with IgG antiphospholipid antibodies, which can cross the placental barrier. In this case, there was no history of maternal antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or connective tissue disease. Neonatal abnormalities associated with perinatal arterial stroke that could be considered in this case include those that may occur in the mother and others listed in [Table 2](#t02).[6](#core-r006) Despite the family history of pulmonary embolism, the mild transient elevation in the patient's prothrombin time, and the possible thrombus on the tricuspid valve, testing in this case failed to reveal any of these abnormalities. Nonetheless, since levels of coagulation and anticoagulation factors in the neonatal period differ markedly from levels later in life, repeated and extended testing of mother and fetus after the perinatal period should be considered in this case.\n",
      "#### Neonatal Infection\n",
      "\n",
      "Fetal and neonatal infections can be associated with high circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, activated platelets, complement components, and decreased anticoagulant proteins that together can promote endothelial activation, platelet adherence, and development of thrombi.[7](#core-r007) Endocarditis might be a cause of the thrombus on the tricuspid valve in this infant, but such a condition is extremely rare in otherwise normal neonates. Local infections of the CNS, including meningitis, ventriculitis, and brain abscess, can lead to a local inflammatory response that can include thrombosis, but this response would generally involve smaller vessels. This infant's blood cultures were negative, and the lack of systemic symptoms of sepsis and the normal chest radiograph argue against neonatal infection as a cause of stroke in this case.\n",
      "#### Severe Placental–Fetal Vascular Lesions\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, thromboinflammatory processes affecting large fetal vessels in the umbilical cord, chorionic plate, and large stem villi have been found in children with cerebral palsy and other forms of long-term neurologic impairment, including stroke[8](#core-r008) ([Table 3](#t03)). These lesions can contribute to stroke in three ways: global impairment of placental function, leading to hypoxia and acidosis; release of inflammatory mediators that can promote a fetal coagulopathy; and formation of placental vascular thrombi that can embolize through the ductus venosus and foramen ovale to the cerebral arterial circulation.Meconium-associated vascular necrosis[9](#core-r009) can be ruled out, since there was no meconium staining of amniotic fluid in this case. Chronic villitis with obliterative fetal vasculitis[10](#core-r010) is more commonly associated with diffuse CNS disease than with localized disease. Fetal thrombotic vasculopathy[11](#core-r011) is unlikely in the absence of fetal thrombophilia or chronic umbilical-cord obstruction. The most likely diagnosis in this case is thus acute chorioamnionitis with a severe fetal inflammatory response.[12](#core-r012) Although histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis is seen in 10 to 15% of term placentas, severe fetal inflammatory responses are much less common, are risk factors for neurologic impairment in both term and preterm infants,[2](#core-r002) and are, in my experience, the placental lesion most commonly seen in cases of spastic hemiplegia and perinatal stroke.[13–16](#core-r013)My choice of diagnostic test would be pathological examination of the placenta.*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): Dr. Krishnamoorthy, what was your thinking when you evaluated this patient?*Dr. Krishnamoorthy:* The combination of apnea, oxygen desaturation, and cyanosis in a term infant suggested the diagnosis of recurrent subtle seizures, which were confirmed by continuous EEG monitoring. Since a common cause of subtle seizures is intracranial hemorrhage, especially subarachnoid hemorrhage with pooling in the temporal-lobe tips, I initially suspected an intracranial hemorrhage. In most cases, neonatal stroke is manifested as focal clonic seizures, so this condition was not as high on our list of diagnoses. However, imaging studies revealed evidence of a stroke. We requested that the placenta be sent from the other hospital for examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pathological Discussion\n",
      "-----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "*Dr. Drucilla J. Roberts:* The placenta had been frozen and was sent to us for examination. It weighed 660 g, and there was no gross abnormality. The cord was inserted eccentrically into the placenta, with no membranous vessels. It was normal in length and diameter, without abnormal spiraling or knots; the membranes were not appreciably discolored, and there were no masses in the parenchyma. Sections of the cord, membranes, chorionic plate, maternal floor, and parenchyma were obtained. Histologic examination revealed a normally developed, mature placenta with moderate acute chorioamnionitis ([Figure 3A](#f03)); a severe, dramatic chorionic-plate vasculitis ([Figure 3B](#f03)); and a mild umbilical-cord phlebitis ([Figure 3C](#f03)). The diagnosis is acute chorioamnionitis with umbilical-cord phlebitis and intense chorionic-plate vasculitis.*Dr. Harris:* Dr. Grabowski, would you like to comment on the management of this case?\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussion of Management\n",
      "------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "*Dr. Eric F. Grabowski:* As a member of the Pediatric Stroke Service, I was asked whether there was a need for anticoagulation in this case. Recurrent thromboembolic events are rare in neonates with arterial ischemic stroke, with such events reported in only 3% of the infants in one study.[17](#core-r017) This low rate reflects the predominance of perinatal and maternal factors, which do not persist after birth, in the case of neonatal stroke. Many neonates with recurrent stroke have at least one plasma-phase risk factor (e.g., factor V Leiden).[17](#core-r017) Although newborns with stroke usually do not require anticoagulant therapy, I would recommend its use, first, if there is a thrombus in the heart or in a major artery, especially in the presence of a patent foramen ovale or atrial or ventricular septal defect; second, if there is a plasma-phase risk factor other than isolated factor V Leiden or the prothrombin gene mutation G20210A; and third, if there is radiologically confirmed progression or recurrence of stroke.In this patient, despite a family history of pulmonary embolism, no plasma risk factor was found. The parents had declined administration of vitamin K after birth, which is given to correct the low levels of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X) in newborns but which also corrects the low levels of anticlotting factors (proteins C, S, and Z). The withholding of vitamin K in this case may have allowed low levels of both factor types to persist. Vitamin K was given on the second hospital day, with normalization of the prothrombin time.Although the thrombus that gave rise to this patient's stroke seems likely to have originated in the placenta, the picture was complicated by the echocardiogram, which showed thickening of the tricuspid leaflets and a prolapsing structure on the valve, findings that we interpreted as valvular thrombus, especially in view of the child's elevated level of D-dimer. Whether this thrombus also originated in the placenta or was formed in situ because of a hypercoagulable state, there was a risk that it would embolize to the brain through the patent foramen ovale. Thus, this patient met our criteria for use of anticoagulation therapy. We administered low-molecular-weight heparin (1.5 mg per kilogram), subcutaneously, twice daily for 3 months.Follow-up echocardiography while the patient was receiving treatment with this regimen showed disappearance of the mobile thrombus at the time of discharge on the 11th hospital day; the thickening of the tricuspid valve had resolved by the 7th week. A patent foramen ovale was still present.*Dr. Harris:* Dr. Krishnamoorthy, will you tell us how the patient is now?*Dr. Krishnamoorthy:* I last saw her about 3 months after discharge. At that time, the phenobarbital had been stopped for about 6 weeks; there was no further evidence of seizure activity, and her neurologic examination was normal. Her pediatrician reported that she had achieved all the normal developmental milestones at 1 year of age and that her development was normal. Most infants with perinatal stroke have a good prognosis, without neurologic deficits, and achieve normal or close-to-normal milestones. This patient's parents declined further imaging studies, but in most patients, the lesions are actually reduced in size on follow-up MRI. In contrast, the prognosis is much worse in cases of antenatal stroke, occurring at a gestational age of less than 28 weeks. Larger areas of tissue loss can be seen on MRI, most patients have cerebral palsy with marked spasticity, and many have abnormal cognitive development.\n",

      "\n",
      "A second-year PG resident tells you to perform an arterial blood gas (ABG) on a patient. You have a few questions about the procedure. The resident says that before performing the ABG, a syringe should be loaded with 0.3 cc of heparin. You wonder if this is true. You also wonder whether a normal pH, HCO3− level, and PCO2 level always indicate the absence of an acid-base disorder. Finally, you wonder whether a different site should be tried if the modified Allen test is negative. You also wonder whether the radial artery is the preferred site for an ABG.\n",
      "### Arterial Blood Gas\n",
      "\n",
      "An ABG is a test that provides information about the acid-base status of a patient. It is obtained by inserting a needle into an artery and withdrawing a small amount of blood. The blood is then analyzed for pH, PCO2, and HCO3− levels. The pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the blood. The PCO2 is a measure of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood. The HCO3− is a measure of the bicarbonate level in the blood. The results of the ABG are interpreted by using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, which is as follows: pH = 6.1 + log10 (HCO3−/0.03PCO2). This equation shows that the pH is determined by the ratio of the HCO3− level to the PCO2 level. If the ratio is high, the pH is high (alkaline), and if the ratio is low, the pH is low (acidic). The pH, PCO2, and HCO3− levels are used to classify acid-base disorders as either respiratory or metabolic. Respiratory acid-base disorders are caused by an imbalance in the exchange of gases between the blood and the lungs, and metabolic acid-base disorders are caused by an imbalance in the production or excretion of acid and base by the kidneys. A normal pH, PCO2, and HCO3− level does not necessarily indicate the absence of an acid-base disorder, because the body has a compensatory mechanism that allows it to maintain a normal pH in the presence of a primary acid-base disorder. For example, if the PCO2 level is high, the kidneys will increase the production of HCO3− to compensate for the acidosis. If the PCO2 level is low, the kidneys will decrease the production of HCO3− to compensate for the alkalosis. If the HCO3− level is high, the kidneys will increase the excretion of HCO3− to compensate for the alkalosis. If the HCO3− level is low, the kidneys will decrease the excretion of HCO3− to compensate for the acidosis. The ABG is an important test in the diagnosis and management of acid-base disorders. It is often performed in critically ill patients, such as those in the intensive care unit. It is also performed in patients with chronic respiratory or renal disease and in patients with a history of alcohol abuse.\n",
      "### Heparinized Syringe\n",
      "\n",
      "The resident tells you that the syringe should be loaded with 0.3 cc of heparin before the ABG is performed. You wonder if this is true. Heparin is a blood thinner that is used to prevent clotting of the blood in the syringe. The heparin is placed in the syringe before the needle is inserted into the artery. When the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood is drawn into the syringe, and the syringe is then removed from the artery. The blood in the syringe is then analyzed for pH, PCO2, and HCO3− levels. If the syringe is not heparinized, the blood will clot, and the test will not be valid. In this case, the resident is correct. The syringe should be loaded with heparin before the ABG is performed.\n",
      "### Modified Allen's Test\n",
      "\n",
      "The resident tells you that if the modified Allen's test is negative, a different site should be tried. You wonder if this is true. The modified Allen's test is a test of the blood flow to the hand. The test is performed by having the patient make a fist with the hand and then releasing it. The patient is then asked to extend the wrist and fingers while the examiner compresses the radial and ulnar arteries. The hand is then blanched, and the patient is asked to make a fist again. The examiner then releases the radial artery, and the hand is observed for color. If the hand is pink, the test is considered positive. If the hand is not pink, the test is considered negative. The modified Allen's test is used to determine whether the radial artery can be used for an ABG. If the test is negative, the radial artery may not be able to provide enough blood flow to the hand, and the test should be performed on a different artery. In this case, the resident is correct. If the modified Allen's test is negative, a different site should be tried.\n",
      "### Preferred Site\n",
      "\n",
      "The resident tells you that the radial artery is the preferred site. You wonder if this is true. The radial artery is the preferred site for an ABG because it is easily accessible and has a relatively large diameter. The radial artery is located on the lateral aspect of the wrist, and the skin is easily cleansed and prepared for the procedure. The radial artery is also relatively superficial, and the needle can be easily inserted into the artery. The radial artery is preferred over other arteries, such as the brachial artery, because it is smaller and more difficult to access. The ulnar artery is also not preferred because of the high rate of complications, such as nerve injury and hematoma. In this case, the resident is incorrect. The radial artery is not the preferred site. The brachial artery is the preferred site.\n",

      "Dr. William C. Moloney\\*: This complicated case not only presents difficult clinical problems but also raises fundamental questions in immunopathology. The first consideration is the possibility that we are dealing with a relapse of Stage IV-B Hodgkin's disease. However, the patient had had a four-year complete remission after MOPP combination chemotherapy, and throughout the final illness there was no evidence of recurrent Hodgkin's disease in the lung, pleura, mediastinum, retroperitoneal area or liver. During the last admission x-ray films of the knee were said to show small osteolytic lesions, but according to my experience this finding is not typical of Hodgkin's disease in bone. I do not believe that the patient had recurrent Hodgkin's disease.May we see the x-ray films now, Dr. Ferrucci?Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: A representative film taken early in the recent admission demonstrates a thick, loculated pleural peel surrounding the entire right lung and extending over the apex along the mediastinum. There is no evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy or an active parenchymal pulmonary process. This right pleural reaction gradually resolved, and the chest appears normal on a film taken on the 53d hospital day ([Fig. 1](#f001)). A film obtained terminally, on the 56th hospital day ([Fig. 2](#f002)), discloses a striking diffuse, nodular air-space process in both lungs, with almost complete confluent opacity in the lower lobes.The films of the spine are normal. The findings in the knee consist of numerous small areas of rarefaction in the proximal tibial metaphysis and in the supracondylar region of the femur. The lateral joint space is somewhat narrowed. No fluid is evident. I believe that this pattern of changes on both sides of the joint suggests disuse atrophy or osteoporosis, possibly associated with an acute intra-articular process. I agree with Dr. Moloney that it is not typical of Hodgkin's disease, which is usually characterized by a focal destructive lesion or a diffuse sclerotic process. A film from the small-bowel study shows a minor diffuse abnormality of the plical folds, with nonspecific thickening and distortion. In a few areas loops of bowel appear slightly narrowed and fixed, but I see no nodular thickening of the bowel wall, discrete masses or evidence of obstruction. Conceivably, the changes were the result of adhesions from the previous laparotomy, but they do not permit a radiologic diagnosis of recurrent lymphoma within the mesentery or the small bowel. The CBT scan of the abdomen shows no abnormality in the para-aortic or mesenteric lymph-node chains.Dr. Moloney: Infection was an outstanding feature in this case, and from the onset repeated bouts of pneumonia and pleural effusions posed difficult and life-threatening complications. On several occasions exudative pleural effusions and sputum yielded positive cultures for enterobacter and *Staph. aureus*. However, repeated examinations failed to reveal tuberculosis or a fungal infection. An open-lung biopsy could not be performed because of a low level of platelets, but a pleural biopsy showed no evidence of tumor or micro-organisms. The rising titer of cytomegalovirus antibody and isolation of this virus from the urine established the presence of cytomegalovirus infection, but it did not appear to have a role in the course of the disease. In addition to the pulmonary infection osteomyelitis, cellulitis and pyuria developed. *Staph. aureus* was cultured from the lesion in the scapula, although repeated blood cultures were negative. In the terminal stage of the illness x-ray films revealed a diffuse nodular infiltration throughout both lungs that rapidly became confluent, resulting in pulmonary failure and death. This final episode was consistent with either fungal or pneumocystis pneumonia.Several interesting developments marked the first and second admissions. After the administration of antibiotics the patient had a reaction characterized by rash, fever, polyarthralgia and marked eosinophilia. He also became jaundiced and was found to have viral hepatitis, a diagnosis that was confirmed by liver biopsy. Although a hypersensitivity syndrome may occur in the prodromal phase of hepatitis, in this case the reaction seemed to be related to the antibiotic therapy.Of particular interest were the intensive efforts made to identify immune complexes in the serum of this patient. The positive serologic findings included a 1:64 titer of rheumatoid factor, a slightly positive test for anti-smoothmuscle antibodies and a moderately positive test for rabbit renal-collecting-duct antibodies. The Raji-cell assay for circulating immune complexes was also positive, as was a test for serum cryoproteins. In view of the marked dysproteinemia, viral hepatitis and hypersensitivity syndrome, the importance of these immunoserologic findings is questionable. Apparently, no tests were done that would indicate specific immune complexes to cells cultured from patients with Hodgkin's disease, with the use of technics recently described by Long and his associates.[1](#core-r001) The positive serologic tests cannot be construed as evidence of the presence of recurrent Hodgkin's disease, nor was there any indication that the immune complexes caused diffuse organ damage in this case.In view of the repeated bacterial and viral infections the question arises whether the patient lacked immunologic defenses. We have no specific information in this regard before the final illness. However, the negative skin tests for PPD, streptokinase-streptodornase and monilia may indicate immunoincompetence. Patients with Hodgkin's disease usually are capable of mounting a humoral response to bacterial infection, but Weitzman and his associates[2](#core-r002) have shown that antibody production may be impaired after splenectomy, radiation therapy and intensive chemotherapy. Whether the splenectomy and MOPP therapy contributed to the lowering of host defenses in this case is a matter of speculation.The hematologic findings were of considerable importance during the course of the disease. On the first admission anemia and thrombocytopenia were present, and abnormal myeloid cells, monocytosis and nucleated red cells were noted in the peripheral blood. After a careful review of the initial bone-marrow smear I agree that a definite diagnosis of leukemia could not be established at that time. However, the erythroid and myeloid abnormalities were suggestive of early erythromyelocytic leukemia. The patient remained anemic and thrombocytopenic throughout the illness, with the development of a marked monocytosis. There are few causes of this degree of monocytosis, although monocytic leukemoid reactions are well known to occur in patients with tuberculosis, Hodgkin's disease and other neoplasms. However, in this case the monocytosis was associated with blasts, immature myeloid cells and the Pelger-Huet anomaly in the peripheral blood. Moreover, monocytosis is not infrequently present in preleukemic states and in the early stages of chronic monocytic and acute monomyelocytic leukemia. In my opinion, the second bone-marrow specimens that I reviewed (Fig. [1](#f001) and [2](#f002)), obtained during the final admission, were diagnostic of acute myelogenous leukemia, with some features characteristic of erythromyelosis. The biopsy specimen was hypercellular, and the myeloid series showed striking dysplasia with numerous huge promyelocytes. Myeloblasts were numerous, and many poorly granulated basophilic and eosinophilic myelocytes and metamyelocytes were present. Among the small per cent of segmented neutrophils some were very large and overlobulated, whereas others contained the poorly lobed nuclei of Pelger-Huet cells. Despite the peripheral-blood monocytosis, an increased number of monocytes or promonocytes was not noted in the marrow smears. The red-cell precursors had marked megaloblastic characteristics, and numerous multinucleated erythroid cells were present. Mitoses, many of them abnormal, were greatly increased, and there were cells with pulverization of the nucleus. A remarkable feature was the abundance of megakaryocytes, many of them with a very abnormal appearance. The plasma cells were somewhat increased, but no tumor cells were seen. It should be pointed out that the serum folic acid level was somewhat decreased (3.1 ng), and the vitamin B12 level was greatly elevated (over 1000 pg per milliliter), findings that are typical of a myeloproliferative state.During the past five years it has become increasingly apparent that patients with Hodgkin's disease, especially those treated with both high-level radiation and intensive chemotherapy, have a greatly increased risk of the development of leukemia. Recently, Coleman and his associates[3](#core-r003) reported a frequency of nearly 4 per cent in their series. Whether the leukemogenic effect is due to an immunologic defect or is the result of a direct injury to myeloid cells by radiation and chemical agents is not established and will have to await a better understanding of the cause and pathogenesis of leukemia.In summary, I believe that this patient had acute myelogenous or erythromyelocytic leukemia, with terminal pneumocystis or fungal pneumonia. In addition, he had viral hepatitis, repeated episodes of bacterial pneumonia, osteomyelitis, cytomegalovirus infection and a hypersensitivity syndrome.Dr. Jerome E.Groopman: An allergic reaction to drugs presumably requires recognition of an antigen, a T-cell function. This patient demonstrated anergy on skin testing. Thus, despite depressed T-cell function he retained the capacity of immediate hypersensitivity. Is there any understanding of this dissociation in immune reactivity?Dr. Alan C. Aisenberg: The immunologic system is very complicated. This man presumably had initially the T-cell defect that is associated with Hodgkin's disease. When Hodgkin's disease is cured by MOPP there is evidence that this defect is corrected. However, we have learned from experience that treatment with MOPP and radiation results in what is probably a B-cell defect because patients thus treated have impaired humoral immunity. Hence, the cellular immune deficit is replaced by a humoral defect, and fulminating sepsis may develop. Indeed, when this patient was first admitted I suspected that he had streptococcal pneumonia as a consequence of the humoral defect resulting from the treatment.Dr. James J. Galdabini: Is there any evidence of a connection between an immunologic defect related to therapy and leukemogenesis in these patients?Dr. Aisenberg: One suspects such a relation, but that's about all. The situation is comparable to that of the neoplasms that develop in patients with a renal transplant. It is more complicated than simple suppression of the immune system leading to cancer or leukemia. I suspect that the immunologic defect has a role, but there are many other factors, such as injury to lymphoid tissue by the immunosuppressant, perhaps with activation of a leukemogenic virus.Dr. Moloney: I didn't stress also that many types of malignant tumor other than leukemia develop in these patients.Dr. Galdabini: Dr. Long, do you have any comment on the positive Raji-cell assay for circulating immune complexes in this case?Dr. John C. Long: Circulating immune complexes have been demonstrated in the serum of patients with Hodgkin's disease and related to the clinical stage, histologic subtype and therapy for the disorder.[4,5](#core-r004) Dr. C. Alan Brown and Dr. Clive L. Hall and their associates,[6](#core-r006) of our laboratory, reported that 50 per cent of the patients with untreated Hodgkin's disease have elevated levels of serum immune complexes as measured by the Raji-cell radioimmunoassay. After treatment most of those patients were found to have normal levels. The circulating immune-complex level in the case under discussion was 15 μg per milliliter, which is only slightly elevated. We examined the serum specimen for reactivity by immunofluoresence with established Hodgkin-disease monolayer tissue cultures,[1](#core-r001) and it was negative, suggesting that the elevated level of circulating immune complexes was not related to recurrence of Hodgkin's disease. It could be attributed to the development of acute granulocytic leukemia since 40 per cent of the patients with this disorder have been reported to have increased immune complexes in the serum.[7](#core-r007)Dr. Galdabini: Dr. Demirjian, you were following this patient from a hematologic point of view. Do you have a comment?Dr. Zareh N. Demirjian: There were several disturbing features of the hematologic disease. He had thrombocytopenia with numerous megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, the serum muramidase level was normal, and the liver biopsy did not reveal leukemic infiltration. These findings were not fully compatible with myelogenous leukemia. The other possibilities that we considered were recurrent Hodgkin's disease and tuberculosis with a leukemoid reaction. The most likely diagnosis seemed to be monocytic or myelogenous leukemia. He was so cachectic that I ascribed part of the megaloblastic changes to folic acid deficiency related to the malnourished state, although many patients with myelogenous leukemia have megaloblasts in the bone marrow.Dr. Galdabini: Dr. Hirsch, you wrestled with some of the problems of the infectious diseases in this case. Do you have a comment?Dr. Martin S. Hirsch: We thought that the cytomegalovirus might have a role in the development of the hepatitis and in the formation of circulating immune complexes. Hepatitis and immunologic alterations are common in patients with overt cytomegalovirus infection,[8,9](#core-r008) and immune complexes have been described.[10](#core-r010)Dr. Galdabini: Dr. Zusman, how did the medical students approach this case?Dr. Randall M. Zusman: They thought that this patient had miliary tuberculosis and raised the question of recurrence of Hodgkin's disease because of the evidence of an immunocompromised state and a malabsorption syndrome. They decided that the Hodgkin's disease had indeed recurred. However, they did not think that it was necessary to postulate that it had infiltrated the bone marrow, since they concluded that tuberculosis involving the marrow could account for the hematologic findings.\n",

      "-----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Long: At the post-mortem examination the bone marrow was infiltrated with immature myeloid cells that had almost completely replaced the normal hematopoietic elements ([Fig. 5](#f005)). Leukemic infiltrates were found in the retroperitoneal and mediastinal lymph nodes, liver, kidneys, lungs and heart and in the meninges and subarachnoid space overlying the cerebral cortex. Giemsa-stained sections revealed scattered eosinophilic myelocytes within the leukemic infiltrates. Cytochemical stains confirmed the granulocytic origin of the neoplasm since many of the leukemic cells were found to contain naphthol-AS-D-chloroacetate esterase ([Fig. 6](#f006)).The lungs contained multiple, bilateral white nodules, 0.5 to 1.0 cm in diameter, in the upper lobes, and there was confluent yellowish consolidation of the lower lobes and lingula. Microscopical examination disclosed that the nodules were well demarcated leukemic infiltrates surrounding arterioles and within alveoli ([Fig. 7](#f007)). The lower-lobe consolidation was due to an acute necrotizing pneumonitis with areas of caseous necrosis and an inflammatory-cell infiltrate composed predominantly of mononuclear cells with very few granulocytes. A Ziehl-Neelsen stain revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli within many of the mononuclear inflammatory cells and in areas of necrosis adjacent to bronchioles. Post-mortem cultures of the lung for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* were negative. There was no definite histologic evidence of viral pneumonitis, and no intranuclear viral inclusions were found in the lungs. Nonetheless, cytomegalovirus was cultured from a post-mortem specimen of the lung.There was no evidence of viral hepatitis at autopsy. We found sinusoidal leukemic infiltrates in the liver but no hepatocellular necrosis, and cultures of the liver for cytomegalovirus were negative. Because of these post-mortem findings we reviewed the liver-biopsy specimen initially interpreted as hepatitis possibly due to cytomegalovirus. A chloroacetate-esterase stain of the specimen revealed a few positive large, abnormal cells similar to those observed in the hepatic leukemic infiltrates at autopsy. In retrospect, it seems possible that the cellular infiltrate in the biopsy specimen reflected early involvement by myelogenous leukemia rather than viral hepatitis.In summary, the findings at autopsy were widely disseminated acute granulocytic leukemia and a terminal tuberculous pneumonitis. There was no evidence of residual Hodgkin's disease.Dr. Thomas P. Stossel: Dr. Moloney, do you believe that one can see Auer rods in cases of miliary tuberculosis, as has been proposed?Dr. Moloney: No. I believe that in such cases both tuberculosis and acute myelogenous leukemia are present.This case brings up many problems. We are dealing with a different kind of leukemia in this patient. By our therapy we create an entirely different milieu in which the leukemia develops. Its appearance is unlike that of the de novo form of the disease. As in older patients with so-called refractory or dysmyelopoietic anemia, the emergence of leukemia is probably due to a membrane change that allows the cells to become neoplastic. It seems to me that patients who have had intensive radiation therapy or chemotherapy provide exceptional opportunities to study preleukemia and early stages of leukemia. Such investigations, especially those employing cell-culture methods, may make important contributions to the understanding of the leukemogenic process in human beings.Dr. Aisenberg: When we were following this patient we were slow to appreciate the development of preleukemia. He was seen before it became clear that this occurrence is not infrequent in patients with treated Hodgkin's disease. The fact that he hadn't had radiation therapy gave us more pause in making the diagnosis of leukemia. As the picture evolved the possibility of leukemia was increasingly considered.Dr. Long: Dr. Hirsch, what is your opinion of the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in this case? The x-ray film of the chest obtained four days before death was normal, and then bilateral pulmonary infiltrates appeared terminally. Despite the presence of innumerable acid-fast bacilli in sections of the lung, post-mortem cultures for tuberculosis were negative.Dr. Hirsch: Specimens were cultured and smeared for acid-fast bacilli 13 times while the patient was alive, and the results were negative. When he had the rapid terminal development of bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates we thought that another infectious agent, such as pneumocystis, cytomegalovirus, Legionnaires' bacillus or an opportunistic fungus, was probably involved. It is surprising that the autopsy revealed caseous necrosis in the lungs and not elsewhere, as one would expect with miliary tuberculosis. The process didn't behave like acute tuberculous pneumonia either, because one would expect to find a different radiologic and histologic appearance and acid-fast bacilli. I share your bafflement about why acid-fast organisms didn't grow on post-mortem culture.Dr. Long: With such unequivocal histologic evidence for acid-fast bacilli in the lungs perhaps the pathogen was an atypical strain of mycobacterium.\n",

      "Reasoning:\n",
      "Okay, let's think this through.\n",
      "\n",
      "An overload of the denture base means the denture is putting excessive force or pressure on the underlying tissues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question is asking what causes this overload.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the bases are too small, they would likely not provide enough surface area to distribute the force evenly, potentially causing localized pressure points and discomfort, but not necessarily an overload.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the bases are too large, they would provide a larger surface area, which would help to distribute the force more evenly across the underlying tissues. This would reduce the risk of overload and discomfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the teeth are small, it could affect the bite balance, but it wouldn't directly cause an overload of the denture base itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the teeth are large, it could potentially cause an overload if the denture is not properly adjusted to accommodate the larger teeth and the resulting increased vertical dimension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the options, the most direct cause of an overload of the denture base would be if the bases are too large, as this would reduce the surface area for force distribution and increase the risk of localized pressure and discomfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the correct answer is B. Too large bases.\n",

       "{'raw': {'Question': 'A 31-year-old woman with a history of left adnexal excision for torsion followed by ovarian remnant excision presents with recurrent left lumbar pain radiating to the left lower quadrant, back, and medial left thigh. Initial evaluation revealed a soft-tissue density at the aortic bifurcation on CT scan. MRI of the abdomen now shows a 5.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm mass encasing the aorta just above its bifurcation, encasing the inferior mesenteric artery, and extending slightly along the common iliac vessels. The mass has signal intensity similar to surrounding areas on T1-weighted imaging, slightly reduced signal on T2-weighted imaging, and enhances with gadolinium. Angiography reveals smooth, focal narrowing of both common iliac arteries and a smoothly tapered appearance of the proximal branches of the inferior mesenteric artery, without arterial occlusion or a hypervascular retroperitoneal mass. Urinary and plasma hormone studies are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, a functioning pheochromocytoma. Phenoxybenzamine initially controlled her blood pressure and pain, but her back pain has worsened, and hypertension control is now inadequate. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the mass yielded inadequate tissue for diagnostic studies. Given this clinical picture, what is the most appropriate next step in management?',\n",
       "  'Complex_CoT': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Ashby C. Moncure[\\\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic findings?Dr. Rhonda K. McDowell: An abdominal MRI scan ([Figure 1](#f01)) shows an abnormal mass of tissue surrounding the aorta and encasing the inferior mesenteric artery. The mass extends down to the bifurcation of the iliac vessels. The intravenous urographic study ([Figure 2](#f02)) is normal, except for a small pericaliceal diverticulum. An angiogram ([Figure 3](#f03)) shows a slight narrowing of the distal aorta, the proximal portions of the iliac arteries, and the inferior mesenteric artery — findings consistent with the encasement of these vessels by a mass.Dr. Moncure: Both neoplastic and inflammatory causes of a mass in this anatomical area must be considered. Primary tumors of the retroperitoneum include various sarcomas; neurogenic tumors, such as neurofibroma and ganglioneuroma; chromaffin-cell tumors; lymphomas; and diffuse retroperitoneal carcinoma, which is often of pancreatic origin or of prostatic origin in men. The retroperitoneal equivalent of the desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall, called fibromatosis, is usually located in the bowel mesentery. Chordomas may arise in the lumbar spine and encase the anterior veins and arteries. The long duration of this woman's symptoms; the discrete, confined appearance of the mass on imaging, with minimal arterial encasement and no venous encasement; and the absence of lymphadenopathy make a primary or metastatic neoplasm an unlikely diagnosis.The location of the mass and the presence of hypertension led the patient's physicians to consider a diagnosis of extraadrenal pheochromocytoma, which can synthesize catecholamines and cause life-threatening hypertension. The adrenal medulla is the site of pheochromocytoma in 90 percent of cases, and most of the remainder arise in the paraaortic sympathetic nervous system. An important extraadrenal site is the organ of Zuckerkandl, adjacent to the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery. These tumors usually have a very vascular appearance on angiographic examination, in contrast to the mass in this case, which was relatively avascular.The laboratory diagnosis of pheochromocytoma depends on the demonstration of elevated levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in plasma and urine. There are many pitfalls in the biochemical diagnosis. Different centers rely on different tests, but generally, the initial screening test is a measurement of the metabolites of catecholamines in a 24-hour urine specimen. A high urinary norepinephrine value with minor elevations of the epinephrine level has been reported to suggest an extraadrenal origin, since epinephrine can be formed by enzymes found only in the adrenal medulla. Urinary assays may be more reliable in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma than determinations of plasma levels of catecholamines, because the pain and stress caused by the needle prick to obtain blood may raise the plasma catecholamine values. In this case, the biochemical findings are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, a functioning pheochromocytoma.Phenoxybenzamine, a combined α1- and α2-adrenergic blocker, reduces blood pressure and symptoms when given orally (10 to 20 mg three times a day) in patients with pheochromocytoma. This drug is used to control blood pressure, to reverse the vasoconstriction and allow volume expansion, and to restore adrenergic vascular reflexes in preparation for invasive diagnostic procedures, such as angiographic examination, and for surgery. The patient's physicians obviously believed that an extraadrenal pheochromocytoma was a possible diagnosis, as evidenced by the administration of phenoxybenzamine as preparation for the invasive diagnostic procedure, and pheochromocytoma must be considered seriously in the differential diagnosis in this case.Among the possible inflammatory causes of the mass, one must consider retroperitoneal fibrosis, which can be idiopathic or secondary. Secondary retroperitoneal fibrosis may have numerous causes ([Table 3](#t03)). There is no evidence that any of these conditions were responsible for this patient's retroperitoneal mass.In most cases, retroperitoneal fibrosis is idiopathic. The idiopathic form was initially described in 1948 by Ormond.[1](#core-r001) It is characterized by fibroblastic proliferation, which may extend from the deep pelvic structures to the renal vessels, with variable compression or encasement of such structures as the ureters, nerves, aorta, and iliac arteries, and in rare cases, the iliac veins and inferior vena cava. There have been scattered reports of involvement of the biliary tree and duodenum and of simultaneous involvement of the mediastinum, thyroid gland, maxillary sinuses, and retrobulbar optic area.[2](#core-r002) Many investigators believe that retroperitoneal fibrosis is an autoimmune disorder.Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis may present with generalized symptoms, such as fatigue, fever, and weight loss, or with variable specific symptoms related to encasement or compression of various structures. These symptoms include pain, which was prominent in this patient, symptoms attributable to uremia, and infrequently, leg pain and edema. Pain in the flank, lower abdomen, or lumbosacral region is the most common presenting symptom. In rare cases, an abdominal mass is palpated.The type of presentation guides the initial diagnostic approach, but intravenous urographic studies, angiographic studies, and CT scanning or MRI, or both, are usually performed subsequently. These studies may reveal an infiltrative process involving the ureters, kidneys, great vessels, and in rare cases, the duodenum and biliary tree, with variable obstruction of these structures, as well as discrete retroperitoneal masses, such as the mass described in this patient.The biopsy findings may be nondiagnostic in cases involving a retroperitoneal mass. Malignant tumors can be associated with a dense inflammatory reaction, with only inflammatory cells visible in a biopsy specimen; conversely, an inflammatory infiltrate may contain cells that mimic malignant-tumor cells. Surgical exploration with adequate tissue sampling is frequently necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.In patients presenting with ureteral obstruction, the treatment options range from intraperitoneal transposition of the affected ureters after ureterolysis to percutaneous nephrostomy and long-term immunosuppressive therapy. There are numerous reports of the regression of retroperitoneal fibrosis with the administration of azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or corticosteroids and occasionally with the use of tamoxifen.[3,4](#core-r003)In conclusion, the features of this case best fit the diagnosis of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis. The alternative diagnosis, an extraadrenal pheochromocytoma, is less likely because of the relative absence of vascularity on angiographic examination of the mass. I have never seen a cervical, mediastinal, adrenal, or retroperitoneal paraganglioma that was not vascular on angiography. The biochemical evidence of a hypercatecholamine state was also equivocal. I suspect that the diagnostic procedure was an abdominal exploration.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Eugene J. Mark: Dr. Briggs, will you describe the diagnostic procedure?Dr. Susan M. Briggs: We performed an exploratory laparotomy to rule out diseases such as lymphoma. We found a large fibrous mass encasing the lower aorta and common iliac arteries. The ureters adhered to the mass, but there was no obvious hydronephrosis. We obtained multiple biopsy specimens. After debulking the abnormal tissue, we moved the ureters intraperitoneally, having performed a cystoscopy with the placement of stents before the exploration. Since the patient presented with severe back pain and the mass involved the sympathetic nerves, we also performed a bilateral lumbar sympathectomy. Her pain resolved almost immediately after the operation.Dr. G. Petur Nielsen: The biopsy specimens were tan-white and fibrotic. Microscopical examination showed a fibroblastic proliferation with abundant collagen deposition and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and rare eosinophils. The inflammatory infiltrate was predominantly perivascular ([Figure 4](#f04)), but inflammatory cells were also interspersed between collagen fibers; occasional germinal centers were present ([Figure 5](#f05)). The fibrosis and inflammatory infiltrate extended into adjacent adipose tissue ([Figure 6](#f06)). Immunohistochemical studies of fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue showed a mixture of B and T lymphocytes and polyclonality of the lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. These findings are consistent with retroperitoneal fibrosis.Although retroperitoneal fibrosis was first described by Albarran[5](#core-r005) in the French literature in 1906, it did not become well known in the English literature until Ormond's report[1](#core-r001) in 1948. In about 70 percent of the cases, retroperitoneal fibrosis is idiopathic. The disorder can affect all age groups, but it is most common in persons between the ages of 50 and 70 years and occurs about two to three times more frequently in males than in females.[6,7](#core-r006)The various diseases associated with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis are idiopathic mediastinal fibrosis, Riedel's thyroiditis, pseudotumor of the orbit, sclerosing cholangitis, and pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma. Different combinations of these disorders can affect the same patients,[8,9](#core-r008) suggesting that idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is one expression of a systemic disease. These disorders have therefore been grouped together under the general heading of “familial multifocal fibrosclerosis” or “systemic idiopathic fibrosis.”[10,11](#core-r010) A case of primary biliary cirrhosis has also been reported in a patient with a history of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis.[12](#core-r012)Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is probably immunologically mediated, in view of its response to corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy and its occasional association with other immune-mediated diseases.[13–15](#core-r013) Immunohistochemical studies have shown that the inflammatory infiltrate is composed of B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes that are predominantly of the T-helper phenotype, and macrophages, as in this case. The presence of several cytokines and adhesion molecules has also been demonstrated, confirming the active nature of the inflammatory infiltrate and supporting an immune-mediated mechanism.[16,17](#core-r016)Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis differs histologically from several other disorders, such as sclerosing lymphoma, metastatic seminoma, inflammatory fibrosarcoma, inflammatory malignant fibrous histiocytoma, metastatic carcinoma, idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis, and mesenteric fibromatosis. It should be relatively easy to distinguish these diseases from idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis, however, by a careful light-microscopical examination in conjunction with immunohistochemical staining in selected cases.\\n\\nAddendum\\n--------\\n\\nAfter the operation, the patient received corticosteroid medication. Her blood pressure returned to normal. MRI scans of the abdomen showed evidence of a decrease in the retroperitoneal process. Intermittent burning pain developed in the left flank, the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, and the back several months after the operation. An increase in the pain led to an exploratory laparotomy one year after the operation, which disclosed a midline adhesion of the middle portion of the small bowel to the posterior peritoneum, with dilatation of the proximal portion of the small bowel and collapse of the distal portion. Lysis of this adhesion and other small-bowel adhesions was performed. No other intraabdominal abnormalities were noted. The patient was well during a short follow-up period after the second operation.\\n\",\n",

These symptoms include pain, which was prominent in this patient, symptoms attributable to uremia, and infrequently, leg pain and edema. Pain in the flank, lower abdomen, or lumbosacral region is the most common presenting symptom. In rare cases, an abdominal mass is palpated.The type of presentation guides the initial diagnostic approach, but intravenous urographic studies, angiographic studies, and CT scanning or MRI, or both, are usually performed subsequently. These studies may reveal an infiltrative process involving the ureters, kidneys, great vessels, and in rare cases, the duodenum and biliary tree, with variable obstruction of these structures, as well as discrete retroperitoneal masses, such as the mass described in this patient.The biopsy findings may be nondiagnostic in cases involving a retroperitoneal mass. Malignant tumors can be associated with a dense inflammatory reaction, with only inflammatory cells visible in a biopsy specimen; conversely, an inflammatory infiltrate may contain cells that mimic malignant-tumor cells. Surgical exploration with adequate tissue sampling is frequently necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.In patients presenting with ureteral obstruction, the treatment options range from intraperitoneal transposition of the affected ureters after ureterolysis to percutaneous nephrostomy and long-term immunosuppressive therapy. There are numerous reports of the regression of retroperitoneal fibrosis with the administration of azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or corticosteroids and occasionally with the use of tamoxifen.[3,4](#core-r003)In conclusion, the features of this case best fit the diagnosis of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis. The alternative diagnosis, an extraadrenal pheochromocytoma, is less likely because of the relative absence of vascularity on angiographic examination of the mass. I have never seen a cervical, mediastinal, adrenal, or retroperitoneal paraganglioma that was not vascular on angiography. The biochemical evidence of a hypercatecholamine state was also equivocal. I suspect that the diagnostic procedure was an abdominal exploration.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Eugene J. Mark: Dr. Briggs, will you describe the diagnostic procedure?Dr. Susan M. Briggs: We performed an exploratory laparotomy to rule out diseases such as lymphoma. We found a large fibrous mass encasing the lower aorta and common iliac arteries. The ureters adhered to the mass, but there was no obvious hydronephrosis. We obtained multiple biopsy specimens. After debulking the abnormal tissue, we moved the ureters intraperitoneally, having performed a cystoscopy with the placement of stents before the exploration. Since the patient presented with severe back pain and the mass involved the sympathetic nerves, we also performed a bilateral lumbar sympathectomy. Her pain resolved almost immediately after the operation.Dr. G. Petur Nielsen: The biopsy specimens were tan-white and fibrotic. Microscopical examination showed a fibroblastic proliferation with abundant collagen deposition and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and rare eosinophils. The inflammatory infiltrate was predominantly perivascular ([Figure 4](#f04)), but inflammatory cells were also interspersed between collagen fibers; occasional germinal centers were present ([Figure 5](#f05)). The fibrosis and inflammatory infiltrate extended into adjacent adipose tissue ([Figure 6](#f06)). Immunohistochemical studies of fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue showed a mixture of B and T lymphocytes and polyclonality of the lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. These findings are consistent with retroperitoneal fibrosis.Although retroperitoneal fibrosis was first described by Albarran[5](#core-r005) in the French literature in 1906, it did not become well known in the English literature until Ormond's report[1](#core-r001) in 1948. In about 70 percent of the cases, retroperitoneal fibrosis is idiopathic. The disorder can affect all age groups, but it is most common in persons between the ages of 50 and 70 years and occurs about two to three times more frequently in males than in females.[6,7](#core-r006)The various diseases associated with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis are idiopathic mediastinal fibrosis, Riedel's thyroiditis, pseudotumor of the orbit, sclerosing cholangitis, and pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma. Different combinations of these disorders can affect the same patients,[8,9](#core-r008) suggesting that idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is one expression of a systemic disease. These disorders have therefore been grouped together under the general heading of “familial multifocal fibrosclerosis” or “systemic idiopathic fibrosis.”[10,11](#core-r010) A case of primary biliary cirrhosis has also been reported in a patient with a history of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis.[12](#core-r012)Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is probably immunologically mediated, in view of its response to corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy and its occasional association with other immune-mediated diseases.[13–15](#core-r013) Immunohistochemical studies have shown that the inflammatory infiltrate is composed of B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes that are predominantly of the T-helper phenotype, and macrophages, as in this case. The presence of several cytokines and adhesion molecules has also been demonstrated, confirming the active nature of the inflammatory infiltrate and supporting an immune-mediated mechanism.[16,17](#core-r016)Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis differs histologically from several other disorders, such as sclerosing lymphoma, metastatic seminoma, inflammatory fibrosarcoma, inflammatory malignant fibrous histiocytoma, metastatic carcinoma, idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis, and mesenteric fibromatosis. It should be relatively easy to distinguish these diseases from idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis, however, by a careful light-microscopical examination in conjunction with immunohistochemical staining in selected cases.\\n\\nAddendum\\n--------\\n\\nAfter the operation, the patient received corticosteroid medication. Her blood pressure returned to normal. MRI scans of the abdomen showed evidence of a decrease in the retroperitoneal process. Intermittent burning pain developed in the left flank, the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, and the back several months after the operation. An increase in the pain led to an exploratory laparotomy one year after the operation, which disclosed a midline adhesion of the middle portion of the small bowel to the posterior peritoneum, with dilatation of the proximal portion of the small bowel and collapse of the distal portion. Lysis of this adhesion and other small-bowel adhesions was performed. No other intraabdominal abnormalities were noted. The patient was well during a short follow-up period after the second operation.\\n\",\n",
       "  'Complex_CoT_extracted': 'Question: A 31-year-old woman with a history of left adnexal excision for torsion followed by ovarian remnant excision presents with recurrent left lumbar pain radiating to the left lower quadrant, back, and medial left thigh. Initial evaluation revealed a soft-tissue density at the aortic bifurcation on CT scan. MRI of the abdomen now shows a 5.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm mass encasing the aorta just above its bifurcation, encasing the inferior mesenteric artery, and extending slightly along the common iliac vessels. The mass has signal intensity similar to surrounding areas on T1-weighted imaging, slightly reduced signal on T2-weighted imaging, and enhances with gadolinium. Angiography reveals smooth, focal narrowing of both common iliac arteries and a smoothly tapered appearance of the proximal branches of the inferior mesenteric artery, without arterial occlusion or a hypervascular retroperitoneal mass. Urinary and plasma hormone studies are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, a functioning pheochromocytoma. Phenoxybenzamine initially controlled her blood pressure and pain, but her back pain has worsened, and hypertension control is now inadequate. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the mass yielded inadequate tissue for diagnostic studies.

       "  'Complex_CoT_after_nejmcr-qa': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Ashby C. Moncure[\\\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic findings?Dr. Rhonda K. McDowell: An abdominal MRI scan ([Figure 1](#f01)) shows an abnormal mass of tissue surrounding the aorta and encasing the inferior mesenteric artery. The mass extends down to the bifurcation of the iliac vessels. The intravenous urographic study ([Figure 2](#f02)) is normal, except for a small pericaliceal diverticulum. An angiogram ([Figure 3](#f03)) shows a slight narrowing of the distal aorta, the proximal portions of the iliac arteries, and the inferior mesenteric artery — findings consistent with the encasement of these vessels by a mass.Dr. Moncure: Both neoplastic and inflammatory causes of a mass in this anatomical area must be considered. Primary tumors of the retroperitoneum include various sarcomas; neurogenic tumors, such as neurofibroma and ganglioneuroma; chromaffin-cell tumors; lymphomas; and diffuse retroperitoneal carcinoma, which is often of pancreatic origin or of prostatic origin in men. The retroperitoneal equivalent of the desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall, called fibromatosis, is usually located in the bowel mesentery. Chordomas may arise in the lumbar spine and encase the anterior veins and arteries. The long duration of this woman's symptoms; the discrete, confined appearance of the mass on imaging, with minimal arterial encasement and no venous encasement; and the absence of lymphadenopathy make a primary or metastatic neoplasm an unlikely diagnosis.The location of the mass and the presence of hypertension led the patient's physicians to consider a diagnosis of extraadrenal pheochromocytoma, which can synthesize catecholamines and cause life-threatening hypertension. The adrenal medulla is the site of pheochromocytoma in 90 percent of cases, and most of the remainder arise in the paraaortic sympathetic nervous system. An important extraadrenal site is the organ of Zuckerkandl, adjacent to the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery. These tumors usually have a very vascular appearance on angiographic examination, in contrast to the mass in this case, which was relatively avascular.The laboratory diagnosis of pheochromocytoma depends on the demonstration of elevated levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in plasma and urine. There are many pitfalls in the biochemical diagnosis. Different centers rely on different tests, but generally, the initial screening test is a measurement of the metabolites of catecholamines in a 24-hour urine specimen. A high urinary norepinephrine value with minor elevations of the epinephrine level has been reported to suggest an extraadrenal origin, since epinephrine can be formed by enzymes found only in the adrenal medulla. Urinary assays may be more reliable in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma than determinations of plasma levels of catecholamines, because the pain and stress caused by the needle prick to obtain blood may raise the plasma catecholamine values. In this case, the biochemical findings are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, a functioning pheochromocytoma.Phenoxybenzamine, a combined α1- and α2-adrenergic blocker, reduces blood pressure and symptoms when given orally (10 to 20 mg three times a day) in patients with pheochromocytoma. This drug is used to control blood pressure, to reverse the vasoconstriction and allow volume expansion, and to restore adrenergic vascular reflexes in preparation for invasive diagnostic procedures, such as angiographic examination, and for surgery. The patient's physicians obviously believed that an extraadrenal pheochromocytoma was a possible diagnosis, as evidenced by the administration of phenoxybenzamine as preparation for the invasive diagnostic procedure, and pheochromocytoma must be considered seriously in the differential diagnosis in this case.Among the possible inflammatory causes of the mass, one must consider retroperitoneal fibrosis, which can be idiopathic or secondary. Secondary retroperitoneal fibrosis may have numerous causes ([Table 3](#t03)). There is no evidence that any of these conditions were responsible for this patient's retroperitoneal mass.In most cases, retroperitoneal fibrosis is idiopathic. The idiopathic form was initially described in 1948 by Ormond.[1](#core-r001) It is characterized by fibroblastic proliferation, which may extend from the deep pelvic structures to the renal vessels, with variable compression or encasement of such structures as the ureters, nerves, aorta, and iliac arteries, and in rare cases, the iliac veins and inferior vena cava.

You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nA 26-year-old woman presents with a 7-week history of progressive symptoms including severe occipital headache unresponsive to migraine treatments, somnolence, dysphoria, short-term memory problems, confusion, agitation, depersonalization, visual hallucinations, incoherent speech, abnormal movements (including hyperextension of the arms and mouth movements), fever, elevated creatine kinase, a generalized tonic-clonic seizure with bradycardia (30-39 bpm), and autonomic instability (facial flushing, diaphoresis, tachycardia, irregular breathing, pinpoint pupils). Initial workup revealed negative Lyme and syphilis tests, normal CT scans of the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing modestly elevated protein, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and oligoclonal bands. MRI of the brain was normal. The patient has a history of migraine headaches, obesity, asthma, seasonal allergies, smoking, and weekend alcohol use. She reported using a drug containing cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, ecstasy, and possibly salvia several days before symptom onset. She was found to have a 1.6 cm left ovarian lesion containing fat and calcifications on CT imaging, confirmed by pelvic ultrasound as a hyperechogenic focus containing fat and internal calcification. Given this presentation, what is the most appropriate next step in management?<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n<|im_start|>think\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\n*Dr. Thomas D. Sabin:* May we review the imaging studies?*Dr. Jeffrey A. Jednacz:* CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis show atelectasis of the left lower lobe due to mucous plugging, with partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe. There are multiple peripheral, wedge-shaped areas of decreased enhancement in both kidneys ((#f01)). This appearance is most commonly seen in pyelonephritis. Other possible causes are renal infarctions or microvascular disease, as well as lymphoma, although lymphoma is less likely, because there is no lymphadenopathy and the kidneys are normal in size. The left ovary has a small mass containing fat and calcium that is consistent with an ovarian dermoid cyst ((#f01)). A transvaginal pelvic ultrasound shows a hyperechogenic mass containing fat in an otherwise normal left ovary, which is also characteristic of an ovarian dermoid cyst ((#f01)).\\n### Important Features of the History\\n\\n*Dr. Sabin:* This young woman's illness began with an ominous change in the pattern of her migraine headaches, which did not relent despite multiple visits to emergency rooms over the course of 10 days. Somnolence, mood alteration, confusion, difficulty with short-term memory, depersonalization, hallucinations, incoherent speech, and involuntary movements developed. A variety of psychopharmacologic medications failed to alleviate these symptoms. Fever and elevated levels of creatine kinase raised the suspicion of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A tonic–clonic seizure with marked bradycardia was followed by several days of unresponsiveness, with pinpoint pupils. The clinical picture was then complicated by the infections and drug effects that often occur with intensive care.On admission to this hospital, autonomic disequilibrium was manifested as facial flushing, diaphoresis, tachycardia, irregular breathing, and pinpoint pupils. The patient had conjugate darting eye movements, grimacing facial–oral dyskinesias, and involuntary rotation and flexion of the legs. Although her eyes were open, she did not respond to a variety of environmental stimuli. Her reflexes were brisk, but the plantar responses were flexor. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed a modestly elevated protein level, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and oligoclonal bands. The EEG showed diffuse abnormalities.\\n### Localization\\n\\nThis process was widespread but not diffuse, with an absence of elementary deficits, localizing cortical syndromes, cranial-nerve signs, and lateralizing features. The behavioral and memory problems implicate the limbic system, and the other signs suggest involvement of the reticular core of the brain stem. This combination localizes the process to the limbic system and brain stem, where changes in mood, thought sequencing, and autonomic abnormalities can accompany primitive postural and movement disorders of the face, eyes, and limbs. In order for the disease to extend symmetrically through the substantial longitudinal distance between these structures without affecting the surrounding white-matter pathways, it has to be highly selective for neurons that might be further specified by synapses or channels. This patient had a seizure with bradycardia, which is consistent with a limbic origin, since this portion of the cortex has the lowest threshold for seizure. The fluctuating course of her illness argues against a large number of demyelinating, vascular, and aggressive neoplastic processes.The information ultimately provided in the history does allow a specific diagnosis to be made. As the story unfolded in real time, however, the differential diagnosis included a number of possibilities.\\n### Viral Infections\\n\\nAcute limbic encephalitis is seen in patients with herpes simplex virus infection, but these patients have an acute onset, with fever, behavioral changes, and meningismus. MRI reveals swelling, often with hemorrhage, bilaterally but asymmetrically in the temporal lobes, cingulate gyri, insula, or subfrontal areas. The virus usually cannot be cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid, but polymerase-chain-reaction analysis for viral DNA is reliably positive after the first 2 to 3 days, and in this case the results of that analysis were negative. Human herpesvirus 6 may cause a more indolent limbic encephalitis, but it is usually limited to patients with immunosuppression. None of the other common viral encephalitides with behavioral changes have an ingravescent onset, such as that seen in this case.\\n### Systemic Autoimmune or Vasculitic Diseases\\n\\nIn a young woman, systemic lupus erythematosus would be the primary consideration in this category. Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus, with behavioral and cognitive signs, occurs as a presenting feature in about 20% of cases. There may be a wide variety of mood and cognitive problems, along with seizures, headaches, choreoathetosis, stroke, myelopathy, and cranial-nerve palsies. Although neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus could account for all the clinical findings in this patient, including a normal MRI scan and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis with oligoclonal bands, the rapid course to obtundation without lateralizing findings would be very unusual. This patient has none of the non-neurologic features of this illness, and the appropriate laboratory studies are negative.\\n### Hashimoto's Encephalopathy\\n\\nMost patients with Hashimoto's disease are women, and patients with this disorder often have normal thyroid function when encephalopathy develops. A subacute onset of cognitive decline with seizures or multifocal myoclonic jerking may result in the misdiagnosis of prion disease. Abrupt, strokelike episodes with hemiparesis may punctuate the course of the illness and may recur. Although the results of CT are often normal, abnormal signal in the white matter is seen on MRI in about half of patients. There is usually no cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and the diagnosis can be confirmed by the presence of antithyroglobulin or antimicrosomal antibodies. This patient had no history of thyroiditis or hypothyroidism.Sjögren's syndrome can produce chronic cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis with oligoclonal bands and cognitive decline. In contrast with this patient, patients with Sjögren's syndrome often have acute episodes of hemiplegia, ataxia, optic neuritis, or myelopathy, the latter being more consistent with white-matter lesions than gray-matter lesions. The non-neurologic features of Sjögren's syndrome were also lacking in this case.\\n### Whipple's Disease\\n\\nWhipple's disease, which is caused by the bacillus *Tropheryma whipplei,* is usually associated with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. When the nervous system is invaded, a progressive dementia with prominent memory loss, seizures, and involuntary facial and ocular movements may ensue. This patient had facial dyskinesias and darting, multidirectional, conjugate eye movements that appeared to be opsoclonus. In Whipple's disease the diagnostic phenomenon is called oculomasticatory myorhythmia (rhythmic bursts of rapid, simultaneous contractions of the face and jaw, accompanied by convergence movements of the eyes). Patients with Whipple's disease do not have as rapid a decline in their level of consciousness as this patient had. Furthermore, this is a disease most often seen in middle-aged men.\\n### Inflammatory Limbic Encephalitis\\n\\nInflammatory autoimmune limbic encephalitis is characterized by the relatively rapid development — over a period of days or weeks — of difficulty with short-term memory and psychiatric symptoms, features similar to those in this case. It is also characterized by inflammation, usually centered in the medial temporal lobes but often affecting the brain stem, hypothalamus, and a variety of other structures. Limbic encephalitis is typically a paraneoplastic syndrome, in which a non-neural tumor containing an antigen normally present in the nervous system precipitates an autoimmune attack on the neural tissue.(#core-r001) The autoantibodies may attack intracellular antigens (anti-Hu, Ma2, and CV2/CRMP-5 antibodies associated with small-cell lung cancer, germ-cell tumors, and thymomas) and cause cell death, or they may attack components of the cell membrane (voltage-gated potassium channels associated with thymomas and *N*-methyl-D-aspartate receptors associated with teratomas) and cause reversible loss of function.(#core-r002)The finding of the ovarian dermoid cyst in this case thus turns out to be important in arriving at a specific final diagnosis. Dermoid cysts are associated with limbic encephalitis in a manner that fits this case in every way, and are also associated with NMDAR antibodies in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid.(#core-r003) The prodrome consists of a severe headache with stiff neck and malaise in young women. Mood changes are followed by a serious thought disorder, incomprehensible speech, confusion, and hallucinations. There are then seizures and a decreasing level of consciousness. A state of staring unresponsiveness, such as that in this patient, has also been observed; it is called catatonia on the psychiatric service and akinetic mutism on the neurology service. Episodes of increased muscle tone occur, along with facial dyskinesias and pathologic posturing in the limbs, mimicking the neuroleptic malignant syndrome, as in this case. Without treatment, central failure of respiration and death can result.The EEG shows diffuse slowing or epileptiform activity in cases of limbic encephalitis. MRI or positron-emission tomography may show abnormal signal in the medial temporal lobes, confirming that diagnosis, but such imaging is negative in the majority of these cases, as in this one. The negative imaging results are helpful in that many other entities are thus ruled out. The cerebrospinal fluid shows pleocytosis, an elevated protein level, and oligoclonal bands, as in this case, and NMDAR antibodies are found on testing for limbic encephalitis.Reversal of this horrendous state may occur with immunotherapy, but the most dramatic outcomes occur with removal of the ovarian tumor. The tumor contains primitive neural tissue, which presumably provides the antigen responsible for the presence of NMDAR antibodies. The diagnostic procedure in this case was probably the removal of the ovarian tumor, which, along with appropriate immunotherapy, may result in an excellent outcome.(#core-r004) Some patients do recover without specific treatment.(#core-r005)*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): Dr. Sims, you saw this patient on admission. What were your thoughts?*Dr. John R. Sims II* (Neurology): When the patient first arrived, our primary consideration was to rule out infectious encephalitis, particularly herpes simplex virus infection. She initially had a positive test for the virus, which turned out to be a false positive result. We were struck, as was Dr. Sabin, by the discrepancy between the severity of the clinical findings and the results of laboratory and imaging studies and the EEG. We rapidly considered a paraneoplastic process, as well as a variety of metabolic diseases, and awaited the results of these tests.*Dr. Harris:* Dr. Kolp, what was the diagnostic procedure?*Dr. Rebecca Kolp* (Obstetrics and Gynecology): The standard operative management for an ovarian dermoid cyst is laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. However, with cystectomy, there is a risk of leaving behind some of the cyst wall. In view of this patient's clinical instability, I wanted to ensure that none of the cyst was left behind; I therefore opted for a laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy, which was performed without complication.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\n*Dr. Paul N. Staats:* On gross examination, the ovary measured 2.8 cm at its greatest dimension and was largely replaced by a cystic and solid mass that contained hair and yellow, caseous material. On histologic examination, there were mature tissue types deriving from all three embryonic germ layers ((#f02)). The diagnosis is mature cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst), the most common of the ovarian tumors, which accounts for 60% of benign ovarian neoplasms.(#core-r006) Teratomas are often found incidentally; however, torsion, infection, or rupture with peritonitis can occur. Much more rarely, these tumors are associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia,(#core-r007) retinopathy,(#core-r008) exercise-induced urticarial vasculitis,(#core-r009) polyarthritis,(#core-r010) and limbic encephalitis.(#core-r003)Samples of the patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid contained antibodies that reacted with sections of rat hippocampus ((#f02)), an area of the brain that is rich in the NR1/NR2B heteromer of NMDAR, bound to the surface of cultured rat hippocampal neurons ((#f02)), and bound to human embryonic kidney cells transfected with the NR1 and NR2B subunits of NMDAR. These results confirm the diagnosis of anti-NMDAR antibody–mediated paraneoplastic encephalitis associated with ovarian teratoma. A role of the teratoma in stimulating the production of antibody is suggested in one study by the presence of mature neural tissue in the tumors, the demonstration of reactivity of the patients' autoantibodies and commercial anti-NR2 antibodies with the teratoma, clinical improvement (usually a nearly complete recovery) with a drop in anti-NMDAR antibody titers in nearly all patients after removal of the teratoma, the death of two of the three patients who were not treated surgically, and recurrences of neurological symptoms associated with recurrence of the teratoma.(#core-r003)*Dr. Harris:* Dr. Scott, can you give us follow-up information?*Dr. Brian J. Scott* (Neuro-Oncology): Within 48 hours after the operation, the patient was able to answer basic questions appropriately and write her name. Her tracheostomy tube was decannulated on postoperative day 3. She made steady improvement until postoperative day 6, when she became agitated and tremulous, expressed distrust of the staff and her family, and had visual hallucinations. Fixed laterocollis developed, which had occurred earlier during the course of her disease before treatment began. Immune globulin (400 mg per kilogram of body weight in 5 daily doses) was given intravenously beginning on the 10th postoperative day in an attempt to interrupt the ongoing encephalopathy resulting from circulating antibodies. The intense anxiety and paranoia diminished during this treatment and resolved a few days after the patient received her last dose. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on the 35th hospital day.At a 2-month follow-up visit, the patient was living at home with her parents. Her family and friends described her as “withdrawn” and uninterested in things that she used to enjoy. She had moderate headache and was sleeping 15 to 18 hours a day. Antidepressant therapy was begun. At the 6-month follow-up visit, the patient had resumed driving and working 40 hours per week at the same job she had had before her illness. Her affect had returned to normal, but she continued to have fatigue and had gained 31.8 kg in the 4 months between visits. She had no subjective cognitive impairment. Formal neuropsychological testing revealed intact memory but some inattention, difficulty with calculations, and slow information processing.\\n<|im_start|>answer\\nAnswer: Laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy.<|im_end|>\\n\"}}"

       "    'output': \"think\\nOkay, let's think this through. The patient is a 25-year-old female with a possible overdose.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out what she might have taken. The family says she took acetaminophen, but they're not sure how much. That's a big red flag.\\n\\nThe family also mentions she had scattered pill bottles. That's concerning. It suggests she might have taken something else, maybe something more dangerous.\\n\\nShe has a history of anxiety, obesity, hypertension, and PCOS. That makes me think about psychiatric medications, especially benzodiazepines, which are often prescribed for anxiety.\\n\\nShe's also obese, which increases the risk of complications from acetaminophen overdose.\\n\\nThe fact that she's not compliant with her exercise program is also important. That could mean she's struggling with her anxiety and depression, making her more vulnerable to overdose.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, I'm worried about a possible benzodiazepine overdose, especially since she's obese and has a history of psychiatric issues.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the options.\\n\\nA. N-acetylcysteine: This is for acetaminophen overdose. But we don't know for sure if that's what she took. It could be a waste of time and resources.\\n\\nB. Charcoal: This is for any kind of overdose. It can help absorb the toxins. It's a good idea to use it, even if we're not sure what she took.\\n\\nC. IV fluids: This is generally a good idea for any overdose, to help flush out the toxins. But it's not the most urgent step.\\n\\nD. Syrup of ipecac: This is to induce vomiting. It's not recommended because it can cause more harm than good, especially in someone who might be depressed or suicidal.\\n\\nSo, between B and C, I need to choose the most urgent and effective step. Charcoal is more likely to help, even if we're not sure what she took. It can absorb a lot of different toxins.\\n\\nTherefore, the next best step is to give her charcoal.\\n\\nAnswer: B. Charcoal\\nanswer\\nAnswer: B. Charcoal.\"})],\n",
