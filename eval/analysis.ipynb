      "----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "*Dr. Raymond W. Redline:* May we see the EEG and imaging studies?*Dr. Kalpathy S. Krishnamoorthy:* A 24-hour bedside EEG, obtained when the baby was having multiple apneic events (see Figure 1 of the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP358161713DC1), available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org), shows runs of high-voltage sharp waves coming predominantly from the left temporal region, lasting for more than 10 seconds; this pattern is considered an EEG hallmark of seizure. Similar runs occurred almost every 5 to 10 minutes for the next 18 hours, which were consistent with frequent seizures. Many of these results were not correlated with any clinical evidence of seizure activity. Since the absence of a correlation between EEG and clinical findings is not uncommon, in difficult cases, continuous bedside EEG can be helpful in deciding on appropriate therapy.Because of the EEG evidence of seizures, the child was given anticonvulsant agents intravenously; after 6 to 8 hours, EEG evidence of seizure disappeared, indicating a response to treatment. A follow-up standard EEG obtained 3 days later was normal.*Dr. Pallavi Sagar:* CT scanning of the brain on the first hospital day without the administration of contrast material showed no evidence of hydrocephalus, intracranial hemorrhage, brain malformation, or mass lesion. However, a subtle hypodensity in the left temporal lobe ([Figure 1A](#f01)) raised concern about acute ischemic injury. The same day, an MRI study of the brain ([Figure 1B](#f01)) confirmed the presence of a wedge-shaped area of loss of differentiation between gray matter and white matter in the left temporal lobe corresponding to the abnormality on the CT scan of the brain, which was consistent with edema. Diffusion-weighted imaging ([Figure 1C](#f01)) showed restricted diffusion, with decreased apparent-diffusion-coefficient values ([Figure 1D](#f01)) suggestive of cytotoxic edema. These findings are consistent with acute arterial ischemic stroke in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery.*Dr. Mary Etta King:* The echocardiogram shows diffuse thickening of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve ([Figure 2A](#f02) and [Video 1](#v01)). In some views, there is a small, linear, prolapsing structure associated with the area of thickening ([Figure 2A](#f02) and [Video 2](#v01)). This may represent a fibrin strand, thrombus, or vegetation associated with the valve. There is a patent foramen ovale ([Figure 2B](#f02) and [Video 3](#v01)), as seen in nearly all newborns, with evidence of intermittent right-to-left shunting on color Doppler imaging ([Figure 2C](#f02) and [Video 4](#v01)). Since the pressures in the right side of the heart of a newborn are still somewhat high, there is the potential for right-to-left embolization through the patent foramen ovale.*Dr. Redline:* This 1-day-old infant had unexplained episodes of apnea after birth by cesarean section at 41 weeks 4 days' gestation. The birth was complicated by prolonged labor, artificial rupture of the membranes 17 hours before delivery, and a maternal temperature of 38.0°C. This presentation could result from a number of conditions.\n",
      "### Chorioamnionitis\n",
      "\n",
      "Long labor, a prolonged period between artificial rupture of the membranes and delivery, maternal fever, a high maternal white-cell count, and a ratio of immature to total neutrophils in the newborn that is at the upper limit of the normal range are suggestive, but not diagnostic, of chorioamnionitis in this case.[1](#core-r001) Chorioamnionitis is an infection of the placental membranes usually caused by organisms spreading to the uterus from the lower genital tract. The clinical diagnosis of chorioamnionitis has high false negative and false positive rates as compared with the gold standard, placental histopathological diagnosis.[2](#core-r002)\n",
      "### Apneic Spells\n",
      "\n",
      "Apneic spells, defined as cessation of respirations for 15 to 20 seconds or more in the first 6 months of life, are frequently associated with oxygen desaturation and reflex bradycardia.[3](#core-r003) In preterm infants, the normal stimulation of respiratory drive triggered by transient arterial hypoxia and increased hypercapnia is commonly delayed, and prolonged periods of apnea can occur in the absence of a specific cause. In term infants, such as this one, apneic spells are usually observed in association with other abnormalities. Causes of apneic spells originating outside the central nervous system (CNS) include sepsis, genetic metabolic disorders, congenital heart disease, gastroesophageal reflux, and poor pharyngeal coordination. Causes that originate within the CNS include hypoventilation syndromes, parenchymal lesions, and seizures. In this patient, seizures were documented by EEG and were responsible for the episodes of bradypnea and apnea.\n",
      "### Neonatal Seizures\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike seizures in later life, neonatal seizures are often brief and subtle.[4](#core-r004) They usually require EEG confirmation and have a distinct spectrum of eliciting factors. Causes of neonatal seizure not associated with the CNS include drug withdrawal, electrolyte imbalance, pyridoxine deficiency, and genetic–metabolic disorders. In this case, there was no history of maternal substance abuse or positive results of drug testing. Serum sodium, calcium, and glucose levels were normal, and the seizures responded to medication without pyridoxine supplementation. The list of inborn errors of metabolism associated with neonatal seizures is long. Most are characterized by hypotonia, lethargy, coma, or ataxia rather than the hypertonia and normal consciousness in this patient. Furthermore, localization of seizures to the left temporal lobe of the brain, normal screening laboratory values, a negative family history, and the absence of extra-CNS manifestations make these diagnoses unlikely.Causes of seizures arising within the CNS include hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, maldevelopment of the CNS, and cerebrovascular lesions. This infant's Apgar scores were normal, and there were no signs or symptoms of neonatal encephalopathy, ruling out a hypoxic–ischemic event. Cerebrovascular lesions can affect veins or arteries. Venous lesions include sinus venous thrombosis, hemorrhagic infarction, and malformations. Arterial lesions include strokes due to occlusion of large or small arteries and global cerebral hypoperfusion, causing necrosis of tissue at the periphery of arterial vascular beds (known as watershed infarcts). Radiologic studies showed a lesion in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery, a finding consistent with perinatal arterial stroke.\n",
      "### Perinatal Ischemic Stroke\n",
      "\n",
      "The features of this case meet the defining criterion for perinatal ischemic stroke: focal disruption of cerebral blood flow due to arterial or venous thrombosis occurring between the 20th week of fetal life and the 28th postnatal day and confirmed by neuroimaging or neuropathological studies.[5](#core-r005) Neonatal stroke is the most common known cause of cerebral palsy in term infants such as this one. Although rare cases are caused by malformed or damaged blood vessels or infectious vasculitis,[6](#core-r006) these causes are especially uncommon in the early perinatal period and thus are unlikely in this case. The remaining cases are attributable to thromboembolic disease, the probable diagnosis here. Thromboembolic lesions most commonly affect the left middle cerebral artery, possibly reflecting a more direct route of spread to this artery through a patent foramen ovale than to other cerebral arteries. This patient had no obvious risk factors for thromboembolic disease, such as indwelling catheters or cardiac malformations. Among the multiple risk factors ([Table 2](#t02)), those most relevant to this case are fetal thrombophilia, neonatal infection, and thromboinflammatory disorders of the placenta.\n",
      "#### Fetal Thrombophilia\n",
      "\n",
      "As in adult and pediatric stroke, underlying thrombophilic disorders are important risk factors for perinatal stroke. The only maternal thrombophilias implicated in neonatal stroke are diseases associated with IgG antiphospholipid antibodies, which can cross the placental barrier. In this case, there was no history of maternal antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or connective tissue disease. Neonatal abnormalities associated with perinatal arterial stroke that could be considered in this case include those that may occur in the mother and others listed in [Table 2](#t02).[6](#core-r006) Despite the family history of pulmonary embolism, the mild transient elevation in the patient's prothrombin time, and the possible thrombus on the tricuspid valve, testing in this case failed to reveal any of these abnormalities. Nonetheless, since levels of coagulation and anticoagulation factors in the neonatal period differ markedly from levels later in life, repeated and extended testing of mother and fetus after the perinatal period should be considered in this case.\n",
      "#### Neonatal Infection\n",
      "\n",
      "Fetal and neonatal infections can be associated with high circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, activated platelets, complement components, and decreased anticoagulant proteins that together can promote endothelial activation, platelet adherence, and development of thrombi.[7](#core-r007) Endocarditis might be a cause of the thrombus on the tricuspid valve in this infant, but such a condition is extremely rare in otherwise normal neonates. Local infections of the CNS, including meningitis, ventriculitis, and brain abscess, can lead to a local inflammatory response that can include thrombosis, but this response would generally involve smaller vessels. This infant's blood cultures were negative, and the lack of systemic symptoms of sepsis and the normal chest radiograph argue against neonatal infection as a cause of stroke in this case.\n",
      "#### Severe Placental–Fetal Vascular Lesions\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, thromboinflammatory processes affecting large fetal vessels in the umbilical cord, chorionic plate, and large stem villi have been found in children with cerebral palsy and other forms of long-term neurologic impairment, including stroke[8](#core-r008) ([Table 3](#t03)). These lesions can contribute to stroke in three ways: global impairment of placental function, leading to hypoxia and acidosis; release of inflammatory mediators that can promote a fetal coagulopathy; and formation of placental vascular thrombi that can embolize through the ductus venosus and foramen ovale to the cerebral arterial circulation.Meconium-associated vascular necrosis[9](#core-r009) can be ruled out, since there was no meconium staining of amniotic fluid in this case. Chronic villitis with obliterative fetal vasculitis[10](#core-r010) is more commonly associated with diffuse CNS disease than with localized disease. Fetal thrombotic vasculopathy[11](#core-r011) is unlikely in the absence of fetal thrombophilia or chronic umbilical-cord obstruction. The most likely diagnosis in this case is thus acute chorioamnionitis with a severe fetal inflammatory response.[12](#core-r012) Although histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis is seen in 10 to 15% of term placentas, severe fetal inflammatory responses are much less common, are risk factors for neurologic impairment in both term and preterm infants,[2](#core-r002) and are, in my experience, the placental lesion most commonly seen in cases of spastic hemiplegia and perinatal stroke.[13–16](#core-r013)My choice of diagnostic test would be pathological examination of the placenta.*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): Dr. Krishnamoorthy, what was your thinking when you evaluated this patient?*Dr. Krishnamoorthy:* The combination of apnea, oxygen desaturation, and cyanosis in a term infant suggested the diagnosis of recurrent subtle seizures, which were confirmed by continuous EEG monitoring. Since a common cause of subtle seizures is intracranial hemorrhage, especially subarachnoid hemorrhage with pooling in the temporal-lobe tips, I initially suspected an intracranial hemorrhage. In most cases, neonatal stroke is manifested as focal clonic seizures, so this condition was not as high on our list of diagnoses. However, imaging studies revealed evidence of a stroke. We requested that the placenta be sent from the other hospital for examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pathological Discussion\n",
      "-----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "*Dr. Drucilla J. Roberts:* The placenta had been frozen and was sent to us for examination. It weighed 660 g, and there was no gross abnormality. The cord was inserted eccentrically into the placenta, with no membranous vessels. It was normal in length and diameter, without abnormal spiraling or knots; the membranes were not appreciably discolored, and there were no masses in the parenchyma. Sections of the cord, membranes, chorionic plate, maternal floor, and parenchyma were obtained. Histologic examination revealed a normally developed, mature placenta with moderate acute chorioamnionitis ([Figure 3A](#f03)); a severe, dramatic chorionic-plate vasculitis ([Figure 3B](#f03)); and a mild umbilical-cord phlebitis ([Figure 3C](#f03)). The diagnosis is acute chorioamnionitis with umbilical-cord phlebitis and intense chorionic-plate vasculitis.*Dr. Harris:* Dr. Grabowski, would you like to comment on the management of this case?\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussion of Management\n",
      "------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "*Dr. Eric F. Grabowski:* As a member of the Pediatric Stroke Service, I was asked whether there was a need for anticoagulation in this case. Recurrent thromboembolic events are rare in neonates with arterial ischemic stroke, with such events reported in only 3% of the infants in one study.[17](#core-r017) This low rate reflects the predominance of perinatal and maternal factors, which do not persist after birth, in the case of neonatal stroke. Many neonates with recurrent stroke have at least one plasma-phase risk factor (e.g., factor V Leiden).[17](#core-r017) Although newborns with stroke usually do not require anticoagulant therapy, I would recommend its use, first, if there is a thrombus in the heart or in a major artery, especially in the presence of a patent foramen ovale or atrial or ventricular septal defect; second, if there is a plasma-phase risk factor other than isolated factor V Leiden or the prothrombin gene mutation G20210A; and third, if there is radiologically confirmed progression or recurrence of stroke.In this patient, despite a family history of pulmonary embolism, no plasma risk factor was found. The parents had declined administration of vitamin K after birth, which is given to correct the low levels of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X) in newborns but which also corrects the low levels of anticlotting factors (proteins C, S, and Z). The withholding of vitamin K in this case may have allowed low levels of both factor types to persist. Vitamin K was given on the second hospital day, with normalization of the prothrombin time.Although the thrombus that gave rise to this patient's stroke seems likely to have originated in the placenta, the picture was complicated by the echocardiogram, which showed thickening of the tricuspid leaflets and a prolapsing structure on the valve, findings that we interpreted as valvular thrombus, especially in view of the child's elevated level of D-dimer. Whether this thrombus also originated in the placenta or was formed in situ because of a hypercoagulable state, there was a risk that it would embolize to the brain through the patent foramen ovale. Thus, this patient met our criteria for use of anticoagulation therapy. We administered low-molecular-weight heparin (1.5 mg per kilogram), subcutaneously, twice daily for 3 months.Follow-up echocardiography while the patient was receiving treatment with this regimen showed disappearance of the mobile thrombus at the time of discharge on the 11th hospital day; the thickening of the tricuspid valve had resolved by the 7th week. A patent foramen ovale was still present.*Dr. Harris:* Dr. Krishnamoorthy, will you tell us how the patient is now?*Dr. Krishnamoorthy:* I last saw her about 3 months after discharge. At that time, the phenobarbital had been stopped for about 6 weeks; there was no further evidence of seizure activity, and her neurologic examination was normal. Her pediatrician reported that she had achieved all the normal developmental milestones at 1 year of age and that her development was normal. Most infants with perinatal stroke have a good prognosis, without neurologic deficits, and achieve normal or close-to-normal milestones. This patient's parents declined further imaging studies, but in most patients, the lesions are actually reduced in size on follow-up MRI. In contrast, the prognosis is much worse in cases of antenatal stroke, occurring at a gestational age of less than 28 weeks. Larger areas of tissue loss can be seen on MRI, most patients have cerebral palsy with marked spasticity, and many have abnormal cognitive development.\n",

      "A second-year PG resident tells you to perform an arterial blood gas (ABG) on a patient. You have a few questions about the procedure. The resident says that before performing the ABG, a syringe should be loaded with 0.3 cc of heparin. You wonder if this is true. You also wonder whether a normal pH, HCO3− level, and PCO2 level always indicate the absence of an acid-base disorder. Finally, you wonder whether a different site should be tried if the modified Allen test is negative. You also wonder whether the radial artery is the preferred site for an ABG.\n",
      "### Arterial Blood Gas\n",
      "\n",
      "An ABG is a test that provides information about the acid-base status of a patient. It is obtained by inserting a needle into an artery and withdrawing a small amount of blood. The blood is then analyzed for pH, PCO2, and HCO3− levels. The pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the blood. The PCO2 is a measure of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood. The HCO3− is a measure of the bicarbonate level in the blood. The results of the ABG are interpreted by using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, which is as follows: pH = 6.1 + log10 (HCO3−/0.03PCO2). This equation shows that the pH is determined by the ratio of the HCO3− level to the PCO2 level. If the ratio is high, the pH is high (alkaline), and if the ratio is low, the pH is low (acidic). The pH, PCO2, and HCO3− levels are used to classify acid-base disorders as either respiratory or metabolic. Respiratory acid-base disorders are caused by an imbalance in the exchange of gases between the blood and the lungs, and metabolic acid-base disorders are caused by an imbalance in the production or excretion of acid and base by the kidneys. A normal pH, PCO2, and HCO3− level does not necessarily indicate the absence of an acid-base disorder, because the body has a compensatory mechanism that allows it to maintain a normal pH in the presence of a primary acid-base disorder. For example, if the PCO2 level is high, the kidneys will increase the production of HCO3− to compensate for the acidosis. If the PCO2 level is low, the kidneys will decrease the production of HCO3− to compensate for the alkalosis. If the HCO3− level is high, the kidneys will increase the excretion of HCO3− to compensate for the alkalosis. If the HCO3− level is low, the kidneys will decrease the excretion of HCO3− to compensate for the acidosis. The ABG is an important test in the diagnosis and management of acid-base disorders. It is often performed in critically ill patients, such as those in the intensive care unit. It is also performed in patients with chronic respiratory or renal disease and in patients with a history of alcohol abuse.\n",
      "### Heparinized Syringe\n",
      "\n",
      "The resident tells you that the syringe should be loaded with 0.3 cc of heparin before the ABG is performed. You wonder if this is true. Heparin is a blood thinner that is used to prevent clotting of the blood in the syringe. The heparin is placed in the syringe before the needle is inserted into the artery. When the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood is drawn into the syringe, and the syringe is then removed from the artery. The blood in the syringe is then analyzed for pH, PCO2, and HCO3− levels. If the syringe is not heparinized, the blood will clot, and the test will not be valid. In this case, the resident is correct. The syringe should be loaded with heparin before the ABG is performed.\n",
      "### Modified Allen's Test\n",
      "\n",
      "The resident tells you that if the modified Allen's test is negative, a different site should be tried. You wonder if this is true. The modified Allen's test is a test of the blood flow to the hand. The test is performed by having the patient make a fist with the hand and then releasing it. The patient is then asked to extend the wrist and fingers while the examiner compresses the radial and ulnar arteries. The hand is then blanched, and the patient is asked to make a fist again. The examiner then releases the radial artery, and the hand is observed for color. If the hand is pink, the test is considered positive. If the hand is not pink, the test is considered negative. The modified Allen's test is used to determine whether the radial artery can be used for an ABG. If the test is negative, the radial artery may not be able to provide enough blood flow to the hand, and the test should be performed on a different artery. In this case, the resident is correct. If the modified Allen's test is negative, a different site should be tried.\n",
      "### Preferred Site\n",
      "\n",
      "The resident tells you that the radial artery is the preferred site. You wonder if this is true. The radial artery is the preferred site for an ABG because it is easily accessible and has a relatively large diameter. The radial artery is located on the lateral aspect of the wrist, and the skin is easily cleansed and prepared for the procedure. The radial artery is also relatively superficial, and the needle can be easily inserted into the artery. The radial artery is preferred over other arteries, such as the brachial artery, because it is smaller and more difficult to access. The ulnar artery is also not preferred because of the high rate of complications, such as nerve injury and hematoma. In this case, the resident is incorrect. The radial artery is not the preferred site. The brachial artery is the preferred site.\n",

The high percentage of monocytes is particularly striking. Myelocytes and metamyelocytes are immature myeloid cells that are not normally found in significant numbers in the peripheral blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presence of 8 nucleated red blood cells per 100 white blood cells is also abnormal. Nucleated red blood cells are immature red blood cells that are typically only seen in the bone marrow.

      "The bone marrow biopsy showing marked hypercellularity with increased megaloblasts and immature myeloid cells is highly suggestive of a bone marrow disorder. Megaloblasts are abnormally large red blood cell precursors, and their presence indicates abnormal red blood cell maturation. The increased immature myeloid cells further support the possibility of a myeloid malignancy.\n",

      "Considering the patient's history of Hodgkin's disease treated with MOPP, the presence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, a very high white blood cell count with immature myeloid cells and a high monocyte count, nucleated red blood cells in the peripheral blood, and a hypercellular bone marrow with megaloblasts and immature myeloid cells, the most likely diagnosis is acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).\n",
      "\n",
      "While other possibilities exist, such as a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) transforming to AML, or a leukemoid reaction, the overall picture strongly favors AML, especially given the prior chemotherapy.

      "A 35-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of chest pain and fever.\n",
      "He was first seen at this hospital six years previously because of an enlarged axillary lymph node, irregular fever and loss of 4 kg in weight. A biopsy of the lymph node revealed Hodgkin's disease, mixed-cellularity type. A staging laparotomy confirmed that the liver, the excised spleen and the lymph nodes from the retroperitoneal area and the porta hepatis were involved. During the next 18 months 12 courses of MOPP (nitrogen mustard, vincristine [Oncovin], procarbazine and prednisone) were administered. The patient improved and was well and active during the next four years.\n",
      "Six months before admission he received influenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide and\n",

      "vaccines. Several weeks later he was given penicillin and tetracycline elsewhere because of pneumonia of the left lower lobe and a left pleural effusion; he failed to improve and returned to this hospital. The hematocrit was 23 per cent; the white-cell count was 20,000, with 20 per cent neutrophils, 33 per cent band forms, 20 per cent lymphocytes, 6 per cent eosinophils, 3 per cent blast forms, 7 per cent myelocytes and 11 per cent metamyelocytes; 2 nucleated red cells, frequent Howell-Jolly bodies and Pelger-Huet cells were observed. The platelet count was 27,000. A bone-marrow biopsy and aspiration disclosed myeloid hyperplasia with increased megakaryocytes; no definite evidence of Hodgkin's disease or leukemia was seen. A culture of sputum grew\n",

A thoracentesis yielded cloudy, yellow fluid that contained 2600 white cells, of which 80 per cent were neutrophils; the glucose was 147 mg, and the protein 5.5 g per 100 ml; the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) was 400 U, and the amylase 8 U; a culture yielded no bacterial growth, and cytologic examination showed no tumor cells; stained smears of pleural fluid and sputum showed no acid-fast bacilli, and no mycobacteria were recovered on cultures. The patient was given prednisone and nafcillin, followed by ampicillin. The fever worsened, a macular rash appeared, and a peripheral-blood eosinophilia of 60 per cent was noted; erythromycin was substituted for other antibiotics. Respiratory distress developed, and no further pleural fluid could be aspirated. Bronchoscopic examination was negative; a limited thoracotomy was performed to decorticate the lung, but no empyema was found. Enterobacter was grown from pleural fluid and sputum, and chloramphenicol was begun; a rash, fever and eosinophilia recurred, and chloramphenicol was discontinued. The patient improved and was discharged on the 41st hospital day on a tapering dosage of prednisone.\n",
      "One week later he returned to the hospital because of recurrent hectic fever and sweats. X-ray films of the chest showed no pulmonary infiltrates; there was minor left pleural thickening. Polyarthralgia appeared; culture of an aspirated specimen of synovial fluid yielded no growth of micro-organisms. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, cryoproteins and hepatitis B surface antigen were negative; a test for hepatitis B surface antibody was positive. The bilirubin rose to 9.4 mg and then fell to 3.5 mg per 100 ml. The glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) reached a peak of 480 U and fell to 123 U; the alkaline phosphatase rose to 17 and fell to 14.2 Bodansky U. Antibody titers to cytomegalovirus increased from less than 1:8 to 1:256, and cytomegalovirus was cultured from a specimen of urine. A Raji-cell assay for circulating immune complexes was positive, 15 μg per milliliter (normal, 10.8 to 11.2 μg). A retroperitoneal computed body tomographic (CBT) scan revealed no evidence of lymphadenopathy. The patient was discharged on the 19th hospital day.\n",
      "Two months before admission he returned to the hospital because of abdominal distress, hematemesis and melena. An x-ray film of the chest was unchanged. An upper gastrointestinal series showed minor deformities of the plical folds of the small bowel, with excessive secretions. Blood transfusions and cyclophosphamide were administered; the bleeding ceased, and the patient was discharged on the 12th hospital day. Two weeks before entry he began to experience right pleuritic pain. One week later fever recurred, without chills or sweats, and he returned to the hospital.\n",
      "He had lost 40 kg in weight during the six months preceding entry, despite an excellent appetite. There was no history of recent cough or sputum production, joint effusions or abdominal pain.\n",
      "The temperature was 39.2°C, the pulse 130, and the respirations 40. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg.\n",
      "On examination the patient appeared pale, wasted and dyspneic. No rash or peripheral lymphadenopathy was found. There was mild scleral icterus. Dullness and diminished breath sounds were heard over the lower half of the right hemithorax; no rales were audible. The heart was not enlarged; a Grade 3 systolic ejection murmur was heard. The liver was not felt. There was no peripheral edema, clubbing or cyanosis, and the joints were normal. Rectal examination was negative.\n",
      "The urine gave a + test for bile but was otherwise normal.

      "Prednisone, acetaminophen and folic acid were instituted. The temperature rose to 39.4°C during the first two hospital days and ranged between 37.2 and 38.1°C on most occasions during the remainder of the hospital stay. On the sixth hospital day another x-ray film of the chest showed loculated fluid in the superior aspect of the right major fissure. Vinblastine was injected, and a second dose was administered on the 13th hospital day. On the following day a repeated x-ray film of the chest disclosed a decrease in the right pleural effusion. On the 15th hospital day microscopical examination of a specimen of sputum revealed a few neutrophils and many gram-positive cocci; no acid-fast bacilli were seen; a culture yielded a moderate growth of\n",

Frozen packed red cells were transfused, and the hematocrit rose to 28.5 per cent; the platelet count was 40,000. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal. Tests of platelet aggregation gave abnormal results. On the 28th hospital day six units of platelets were transfused. A liver biopsy revealed portal and focal periportal inflammation, with scattered small foci of inflammation in the lobules, and slight focal periportal fibrosis; the appearance was believed consistent with low-grade chronic active hepatitis. On the following day the patient complained of pain in the left knee; the joint was red and warm, without a definite effusion. The uric acid was 4 mg per 100 ml. An x-ray film of the left knee showed numerous tiny osteolytic foci; no effusion, fracture or dislocation was observed; the lateral joint compartment appeared slightly narrowed, compatible with mild degenerative disease.\n",

An open-lung biopsy was rejected as offering excessive hazard to the patient, and trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin were begun empirically; sodium bicarbonate was administered by vein. A nasotracheal tube was passed, and ventilatory assistance was given. Hypotension developed, and fresh blood appeared in the tracheal aspirate. The prothrombin time was 17.3 seconds, with a control of 11 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 58 seconds; the thrombin time was 21.4 seconds, with a control of 18.9 seconds. The platelet count was 43,000. Fresh-frozen plasma, vitamin K and additional quantities of sodium bicarbonate were administered, without improvement. Repeated x-ray films of the chest showed progressive confluence of the opacities with dense consolidation of the right lung. Microscopical examination of an aspirated specimen of sputum revealed rare mononuclear cells and no predominant micro-organisms. The temperature dropped below recordable levels; hypotension continued, and the patient died early in the morning of the 57th hospital day.\n",
      "What is the diagnosis of the patient?\n",
      "\n",
      "REASONING:\n",
      "The patient has a history of Hodgkin's disease, treated with MOPP. That's important because MOPP is known to increase the risk of secondary malignancies, especially leukemia.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's had recurrent infections, including pneumonia and pleural effusions. This suggests an underlying immune deficiency, possibly related to the Hodgkin's treatment or the disease itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial blood work six months prior to the final admission showed pancytopenia (low hematocrit and platelet count) and a leukocytosis with immature cells (blast forms, myelocytes, metamyelocytes). Howell-Jolly bodies indicate splenic dysfunction, which makes sense given the splenectomy during staging. Pelger-Huet cells suggest a problem with neutrophil maturation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bone marrow biopsy at that time showed myeloid hyperplasia, but no definite Hodgkin's or leukemia. This could have been a pre-leukemic state or a reactive process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had a Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which is common in immunocompromised individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "He experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, requiring transfusions and cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide is another chemotherapy drug that can increase the risk of secondary malignancies.\n",
      "\n",
      "He lost a significant amount of weight despite a good appetite, which is concerning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final admission shows worsening pancytopenia, a very high white blood cell count with a high percentage of monocytes and blast forms. This is highly suggestive of acute leukemia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bone marrow biopsy now shows marked hypercellularity with increased megaloblasts and immature myeloid cells, strongly suggesting myelogenous leukemia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chest x-ray shows diffuse nodular opacities, which could be due to infection, but given the leukemia picture, leukemic infiltrates are a strong possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "The terminal event involved respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and hypotension, all consistent with complications of acute leukemia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The liver biopsy showed chronic active hepatitis, which could be related to CMV or other infections, or even drug toxicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stool fat test was abnormal, suggesting malabsorption, which could be related to the small bowel abnormalities seen on the upper GI series.\n",
      "\n",
      "The positive rheumatoid factor and cryoglobulins suggest an immune complex-mediated process, which can be seen in leukemia and other hematologic malignancies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the history of Hodgkin's, the treatment with MOPP and cyclophosphamide, the pancytopenia, the presence of blast cells in the peripheral blood, and the bone marrow findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute myelogenous leukemia complicating treated Hodgkin's disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuberculous pneumonitis is less likely given the negative acid-fast stains and cultures, although it can't be completely ruled out without more definitive testing. However, the overall clinical picture strongly favors leukemia.\n",

      "## Thinking\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so we're getting ready for a right hemicolectomy, which is a pretty big deal since it's a surgery to remove part of the colon. This means we're going to be working in the abdominal area, specifically around the right side. Now, let's think about what that means for preparing the patient. We need to make sure the area is sterile, so we can't just cover a small part of the body. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's consider where the surgery is happening. The right side of the abdomen is involved, so we need to cover from the chest down to the pelvis. This is because the surgical site is in the lower part of the abdomen, and we don't want any dirt or germs sneaking in from above or below. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's look at the options. Option A says from the nipple to the mid-thigh. Hmm, that seems like it covers the chest and lower leg, but it might be a bit too high in the chest area for our needs. Option B suggests from the chin to the knee. That seems like it's covering more than we need, especially the face and neck. Option C is from the umbilicus to the mid-thigh. That sounds about right because it covers the abdomen and the lower part of the body but not too much. Option D is from the rib cage to the inguinal regions. This might be okay, but it feels like it's not quite covering the upper part of the abdomen. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's think about what makes sense. We need to cover the whole area from the chest to the pelvis to keep everything sterile. Option C seems to be the best choice because it covers the abdomen and the lower part of the body without going too high or low. It's like the sweet spot for this kind of surgery. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, option C is the way to go. It's the right balance and makes sure we're covering all the bases for a successful surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Final Response\n",
      "\n",
      "The best option for preparing a patient for a right hemicolectomy through a midline laparotomy is to clean and drape from the umbilicus to the mid-thigh. This approach ensures that the entire surgical area, from the upper abdomen to the lower part of the body, is covered, maintaining sterility and minimizing the risk of infection. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n",

You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nA 26-year-old woman presents with a 7-week history of progressive symptoms including severe occipital headache unresponsive to migraine treatments, somnolence, dysphoria, short-term memory problems, confusion, agitation, depersonalization, visual hallucinations, incoherent speech, abnormal movements (including hyperextension of the arms and mouth movements), fever, elevated creatine kinase, a generalized tonic-clonic seizure with bradycardia (30-39 bpm), and autonomic instability (facial flushing, diaphoresis, tachycardia, irregular breathing, pinpoint pupils). Initial workup revealed negative Lyme and syphilis tests, normal CT scans of the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing modestly elevated protein, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and oligoclonal bands. MRI of the brain was normal. The patient has a history of migraine headaches, obesity, asthma, seasonal allergies, smoking, and weekend alcohol use. She reported using a drug containing cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, ecstasy, and possibly salvia several days before symptom onset. She was found to have a 1.6 cm left ovarian lesion containing fat and calcifications on CT imaging, confirmed by pelvic ultrasound as a hyperechogenic focus containing fat and internal calcification. Given this presentation, what is the most appropriate next step in management, beyond supportive care and immunotherapy?<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n<|im_start|>think\\nOkay, let's think this through.\\n\\nThe patient is a young woman with a rapidly progressing neurological and psychiatric illness.\\n\\nThe symptoms include headache, altered mental status, seizures, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysfunction.\\n\\nThese symptoms developed over a relatively short period of time, about 7 weeks.\\n\\nInitial workup was largely unrevealing, but the CSF findings of elevated protein, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and oligoclonal bands suggest an inflammatory process in the central nervous system.\\n\\nThe normal brain MRI makes many structural lesions less likely.\\n\\nThe patient's history of drug use is concerning, but the constellation of symptoms and CSF findings are not typical for drug-induced psychosis or encephalitis.\\n\\nThe presence of a left ovarian lesion containing fat and calcifications is a key finding.\\n\\nOvarian lesions with these characteristics are highly suggestive of a dermoid cyst, also known as a mature cystic teratoma.\\n\\nDermoid cysts are benign tumors containing mature tissues from all three germ layers.\\n\\nThese tumors can sometimes be associated with paraneoplastic syndromes.\\n\\nParaneoplastic syndromes occur when the body's immune system attacks normal tissues in response to a tumor.\\n\\nIn this case, the ovarian dermoid cyst could be triggering an autoimmune response that is affecting the brain.\\n\\nThe neurological and psychiatric symptoms are consistent with autoimmune encephalitis.\\n\\nSpecifically, the combination of psychiatric symptoms, memory problems, seizures, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysfunction is suggestive of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\\n\\nAnti-NMDAR encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies attack the NMDA receptors in the brain.\\n\\nThese receptors are important for learning, memory, and behavior.\\n\\nOvarian teratomas are a well-known cause of anti-NMDAR encephalitis in young women.\\n\\nThe teratoma contains neural tissue that expresses NMDA receptors.\\n\\nThe immune system recognizes these receptors as foreign and produces antibodies against them.\\n\\nThese antibodies then cross the blood-brain barrier and attack the NMDA receptors in the brain, leading to the symptoms of encephalitis.\\n\\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to address the underlying cause of the autoimmune response, which is the ovarian teratoma.\\n\\nWhile supportive care and immunotherapy are important for managing the symptoms of encephalitis, they do not address the source of the antibodies.\\n\\nRemoval of the ovarian teratoma can lead to a dramatic improvement in symptoms and even a complete recovery.\\n\\nLaparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy, which is the removal of the left ovary and fallopian tube, is the preferred surgical approach for ovarian dermoid cysts.\\n\\nThis procedure allows for complete removal of the tumor while minimizing the risk of complications.\\n\\nCystectomy alone carries a risk of leaving behind some of the cyst wall, which could lead to recurrence of the encephalitis.\\n\\nGiven the patient's clinical instability, it is important to ensure that the entire tumor is removed.\\n\\nTherefore, laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy is the most appropriate next step in management, beyond supportive care and immunotherapy.\\n<|im_start|>answer\\nAnswer: Laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy.<|im_end|>\\n\"}}"

The family says she took acetaminophen, but they're not sure how much. That's a big red flag.\\n\\nThe family also mentions she had scattered pill bottles. That's concerning. It suggests she might have taken something else, maybe something more dangerous.\\n\\nShe has a history of anxiety, obesity, hypertension, and PCOS. That makes me think about psychiatric medications, especially benzodiazepines, which are often prescribed for anxiety.\\n\\nShe's also obese, which increases the risk of complications from acetaminophen overdose.\\n\\nThe fact that she's not compliant with her exercise program is also important. That could mean she's struggling with her anxiety and depression, making her more vulnerable to overdose.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, I'm worried about a possible benzodiazepine overdose, especially since she's obese and has a history of psychiatric issues.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the options.\\n\\nA. N-acetylcysteine: This is for acetaminophen overdose. But we don't know for sure if that's what she took. It could be a waste of time and resources.\\n\\nB. Charcoal: This is for any kind of overdose. It can help absorb the toxins. It's a good idea to use it, even if we're not sure what she took.\\n\\nC. IV fluids: This is generally a good idea for any overdose, to help flush out the toxins. But it's not the most urgent step.\\n\\nD. Syrup of ipecac: This is to induce vomiting. It's not recommended because it can cause more harm than good, especially in someone who might be depressed or suicidal.\\n\\nSo, between B and C, I need to choose the most urgent and effective step. Charcoal is more likely to help, even if we're not sure what she took. It can absorb a lot of different toxins.\\n\\nTherefore, the next best step is to give her charcoal.\\n\\nAnswer: B.
