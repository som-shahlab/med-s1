# Validation Accuracy Analysis

## Current State

After examining the curation pipeline and training code, I've found:

1. **Validation Split Creation**: The curation pipeline (`curate_med_s1k_new.py`) creates a validation split (10% of the data) and saves it to separate directories:
   - Training data is saved to `<formatted_path>/train/`
   - Validation data is saved to `<formatted_path>/validation/`

2. **Dataset Structure**: Looking at existing datasets, they use a slightly different structure:
   - The dataset is saved as a DatasetDict with "train" and "test" splits
   - The "test" split is actually used as validation data during training

3. **No Validation Accuracy Logging**: The original training code in `train/trainer.py` only logs training metrics (loss and accuracy) but doesn't evaluate on a validation set.

## Implemented Changes

To enable validation accuracy logging, I've made the following changes:

1. **Updated Dataset Loader**: Modified `PreformattedDataset` in `data_utils.py` to:
   - Accept a `split` parameter ("train" or "validation")
   - Handle both directory structures (train/validation and train/test)
   - Load the appropriate split based on the parameter

2. **Updated Trainer**: Modified `SFTTrainer` in `trainer.py` to:
   - Load both training and validation datasets
   - Create separate dataloaders for each
   - Add a `validate()` method to evaluate on the validation set
   - Log validation metrics (accuracy, loss) to wandb after each epoch

## Benefits

These changes enable:

1. **Monitoring Overfitting**: By tracking validation accuracy, we can detect when the model starts to overfit to the training data.

2. **Better Model Selection**: We can select the best checkpoint based on validation performance rather than just training performance.

3. **Early Stopping**: In the future, we could implement early stopping based on validation metrics to avoid wasting compute resources.

4. **Performance Estimation**: Validation metrics provide a better estimate of how the model will perform on unseen data.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

1. **Early Stopping**: Implement early stopping based on validation metrics to avoid wasting compute resources.

2. **Checkpoint Selection**: Automatically select the best checkpoint based on validation performance.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use validation metrics to guide hyperparameter tuning.
