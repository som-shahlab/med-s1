    "# Case Study 1: Clinical Trial Matching\n",
    "The problem of clinical trial matching is finding patient-trial matches given a dataset of text summaries of patients and text descriptions of trials. In Lotus-speak, this is a \"semantic join\" between patients and trials. The naive approach would be something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for P in patients:\n",
    "    for T in trials:\n",
    "        compute LLM(\"is {P} eligible for {T}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This leads to a quadratic number of LLM calls which will be slow and expensive. A program written in Lotus as demonstrated below will be auto-optimized to run the most efficient algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example one algorithm Lotus may generate will (1) in linear-time predict a trial zero-shot for each patient and then (2) run embedding similarity to quickly find a set of probable patient-trial matches (technically matches between trial and the trial that was zero-shot predicted for the patient) and finally (3) run the LLM on all pairs of this subset of probable patient-trial matches. The Lotus optimizer smartly determines the optimal parameters and variant of this semantic join algorithm."

      "\n",
      "First, looking at the patient note: a 63-year-old man presents with unintentional weight loss and epigastric discomfort after meals. He has no known medical issues or medications. His vital signs are normal except for blood pressure slightly above average (130/75) and a regular pulse rate of 88/min. The upper endoscopy shows a lesion in the stomach with features typical of diffuse-type adenocarcinoma, specifically signet ring cells that don't form glands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, examining the clinical trial: it's about perioperative chemoradiotherapy for potentially resectable gastric cancer. The inclusion criteria specify histologically confirmed primary adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated or carcinoma not otherwise specified, in patients with T2-4 N0-3 M0 tumors. The tumor must be surgically operable (T1N1-3 if T1). They require pre-treatment Port-a-Cath insertion and exclude prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients must also have an ECOG performance status less than 1, meaning they're generally healthy enough to undergo surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exclusion criteria mention in-situ carcinoma, TIN0 after endoscopy, esophageal tumors, prior treatments within the past five years, metastatic disease, certain heart conditions, severe comorbidities, pregnancy or lactation, prior malignancy (excluding specific cases), hearing loss, seizures with medication, and those who can't understand the trial requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient in question is a 63-year-old man with adenocarcinoma of the stomach. His ECOG status isn't mentioned but he's likely to have it <1 since no known medical issues are noted. His tumor features match the inclusion criteria for adenocarcinoma, specifically signet ring cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "He doesn't meet any exclusion criteria either: no in-situ or TIN0, not an esophagus tumor, no prior treatments mentioned, and he's generally a candidate for surgery given his age and lack of comorbidities. His vital signs are within normal ranges except for slightly elevated blood pressure, which isn't typically a reason to exclude someone from such trials.\n",
      "\n",

      "QUESTION:  A 61-year-old woman with a long history of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing but no leakage at night undergoes a gynecological exam and Q-tip test. Based on these findings, what would cystometry most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions?\n",
      "\n",
      "REASONING TRACE:  Okay, let's think about this step by step. There's a 61-year-old woman here who's been dealing with involuntary urine leakages whenever she's doing something that ups her abdominal pressure like coughing or sneezing. This sounds a lot like stress urinary incontinence to me. Now, it's interesting that she doesn't have any issues at night; she isn't experiencing leakage while sleeping. This likely means her bladder's ability to hold urine is fine when she isn't under physical stress. Hmm, that's a clue that we're dealing with something related to pressure rather than a bladder muscle problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that she underwent a Q-tip test is intriguing too. This test is usually done to assess urethral mobility. In stress incontinence, a Q-tip might move significantly, showing urethral hypermobility. This kind of movement often means there's a weakness in the support structures that should help keep the urethra closed during increases in abdominal pressure. So, that's aligning well with stress incontinence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's think about what would happen during cystometry. Since stress incontinence isn't usually about sudden bladder contractions, I wouldn't expect to see involuntary detrusor contractions during this test. Her bladder isn't spasming or anything; it's more about the support structure failing under stress. Plus, she likely empties her bladder completely because stress incontinence doesn't typically involve incomplete emptying. So, her residual volume should be pretty normal. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, it seems like if they do a cystometry on her, it will likely show a normal residual volume and no involuntary contractions. Yup, I think that makes sense given her symptoms and the typical presentations of stress urinary incontinence.\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSWER:  Cystometry in this case of stress urinary incontinence would most likely reveal a normal post-void residual volume, as stress incontinence typically does not involve issues with bladder emptying. Additionally, since stress urinary incontinence is primarily related to physical exertion and not an overactive bladder, you would not expect to see any involuntary detrusor contractions during the test.\n"
