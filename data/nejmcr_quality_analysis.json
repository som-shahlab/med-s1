      "question": "Dr. David M. Dudzinski:\nA 53-year-old man was evaluated in an urgent care clinic of this hospital for 3 months of cough.\nFive years before the current evaluation, the patient began to have exertional dyspnea and received a diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, with a resting left ventricular outflow gradient of 110 mm Hg on echocardiography. Although he received medical therapy, symptoms persisted, and percutaneous alcohol septal ablation was performed 1 year before the current evaluation, with resolution of the exertional dyspnea.\nNine months later, the patient began to have cough that was intermittently productive of yellow sputum. The cough developed shortly after he had returned from travel to Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Antitussive medications did not provide symptom relief. Three years before this cough developed, three discrete episodes of upper respiratory tract infection and sinusitis had occurred, for which courses of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and azithromycin had been prescribed. During the current episode, the cough waxed and waned in intensity, with no clear relation to other symptoms or the time of day.\nTen days before the current evaluation, the patient traveled to the Middle East; the weather was colder than he had expected and he felt chills. During the trip, the cough worsened \u2014 with more frequent and copious production of yellow-green sputum and associated coryza, pharyngitis, frontal sinus \u201cheaviness,\u201d malaise, and fatigue \u2014 such that he had to miss work after he returned home. He called his cardiologist and was advised to present to an urgent care clinic of this hospital for evaluation.\nA review of systems was negative for fever, anorexia, unintentional weight loss, night sweats, dyspnea, hemoptysis, chest pressure or discomfort, pleuritic pain, wheezing, light-headedness, palpitations, syncope, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, and pruritus. The patient had had multiple contacts with nonspecific illnesses while he had been traveling both 3 months and 10 days before the current evaluation. The most recent tuberculin skin test had been performed 10 years earlier and had been negative. He had not undergone seasonal influenza vaccination.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was also notable for placement of an implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia that had been induced during an electrophysiological study. He had allergic rhinitis, obstructive sleep apnea, gonococcal urethritis, and dyslipidemia. Medications included metoprolol succinate and atorvastatin. He had had no known adverse reactions to medications, except prolongation of the corrected QT interval with disopyramide.\nThe patient was born in South Asia, raised in the Middle East, and educated in the United States, where he had lived for the past 25 years. He was an executive and traveled frequently for work, generally to urban areas and only rarely to rural areas, although he had walked barefoot near beaches in various locations in Southeast Asia. He was divorced and had a child. He smoked cigars occasionally and drank 1 to 2 glasses of wine nightly but did not use illicit substances. He had been sexually active while traveling but had used condoms. Several first-degree relatives had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His mother had died 3 years earlier from pulmonary tuberculosis, but he had not been in contact with her during her illness.\nOn examination, the patient appeared to be comfortable. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/89 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. During the evaluation, the patient coughed twice, and the second cough produced light-green sputum with a bloody streak. The oropharynx had no erythema or exudates, but there was a slight yellow discoloration on the tongue. There was no tenderness on percussion of the sinuses or conjunctival hyperemia. There was no cervical, submandibular, supraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Auscultation revealed a clear chest, without rales, wheezing, or egophony. The jugular venous pulse was 6 cm of water. There was a crescendo\u2013decrescendo systolic murmur (grade 3/6) along the left sternal border that increased during a Valsalva maneuver. There was no edema or calf tenderness. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nDr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard:\nA posteroanterior chest radiograph (\nFigure 1\n) showed clear lungs and a slightly enlarged heart, findings that had not changed from a study obtained 1 year earlier. There was a dual-lead ICD that terminated in the right atrium and right ventricle.\nDr. Dudzinski:\nAn electrocardiogram (\nFigure 2\n) was notable for sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy, and T-wave inversions in leads I, aVL, V\n4\n, V\n5\n, and V\n6\n, findings that had not changed from previous tracings. A 5-day course of azithromycin was prescribed, along with acetaminophen, oxymetazoline nasal spray, and a phenol-based topical throat spray. A tuberculin skin test was negative for induration. Results of liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. A transthoracic echocardiogram was notable for a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, a maximum left ventricular wall thickness of 16 mm, systolic anterior motion of the mitral-valve chordae with trace mitral regurgitation, and a resting left ventricular outflow gradient of 16 mm Hg; these findings had not changed from a study obtained 9 months earlier.\nAzithromycin therapy resulted in decreased fatigue and malaise and reduced the frequency of the cough but did not eliminate it. A few episodes of hemoptysis with scant blood occurred, and bloody streaks were present in nasal mucus. After the patient completed the course of azithromycin, additional laboratory tests were performed (\nTable 1\n). Cultures of the stool and sputum were negative, as was examination of the stool and sputum for ova and parasites. A hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel (including a test for antibodies to aspergillus) was also negative, as were tests for galactomannan, 1,3-\u03b2-\nd\n-glucan, and antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2. Testing for antibodies to paragonimus was negative, but testing for antibodies to strongyloides was positive.\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Rachel P. Simmons:* This 53-year-old man with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and allergic rhinitis presented to this hospital with a chronic illness of 3 months\u2019 duration that was characterized by intermittently productive cough, marked peripheral eosinophilia (with an absolute eosinophil count of 3800 to 4550 per cubic millimeter), an elevated IgE level, and normal results on pulmonary examination and chest radiography. His history is also notable for extensive travel and habitation in Asia and the Middle East.Although several features of this patient\u2019s presentation could point us toward the diagnosis, I will focus my differential diagnosis on the development of marked peripheral eosinophilia and symptoms that were localized to the respiratory system. His travel history warrants a thorough workup for tissue-invasive parasites, particularly helminths; however, a multitude of noninfectious diseases can also cause peripheral eosinophilia and respiratory symptoms. The peripheral eosinophil count can be elevated in a broad range of diseases.[1](#core-r1) Peripheral eosinophilia is generally defined as mild (with an eosinophil count of 500 to 1500 per cubic millimeter), marked (1501 to 5000 per cubic millimeter), or massive (>5000 per cubic millimeter).[2,3](#core-r2)\n### Noninfectious Causes of Eosinophilia\n\nEosinophilia can be either a primary or a secondary feature of a disorder ([Table 2](#t2)). Primary causes of eosinophilia and respiratory symptoms are eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic syndromes. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is a severe, progressive illness that develops over a period of days to weeks; this tempo of disease does not fit with this patient\u2019s clinical course.[4](#core-r4) Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is an idiopathic disease characterized by dyspnea and alveolar infiltrates, and patients often have a history of asthma.[5,6](#core-r5) This patient had a history of allergic rhinitis but did not have asthma, his presenting symptoms included cough but not dyspnea, and his chest radiograph did not show alveolar infiltrates. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis of small and medium-sized arteries, and its hallmark features are asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, and rhinosinusitis. This patient meets only one of the six American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria, and thus this diagnosis is unlikely.[6,7](#core-r6) Hypereosinophilic syndromes are a group of rare disorders characterized by persistent peripheral eosinophilia and organ damage, including pulmonary involvement.[5,6](#core-r5) Alternative causes of eosinophilia, such as infection, must be ruled out before this diagnosis can be considered.\n### Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis and Fungal Infections\n\nMarked peripheral eosinophilia is a central feature of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, which is a hypersensitivity reaction to airway colonization by the ubiquitous mold aspergillus.[5](#core-r5) Affected patients typically have productive cough and asthma exacerbations that improve with the administration of prednisone.[8,9](#core-r8) In this patient, the absence of asthma symptoms and the negative test for antibodies to aspergillus make allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis unlikely. Fungal infections, such as coccidioidomycosis, have been associated with peripheral eosinophilia,[10](#core-r10) but the eosinophil count is typically low, not exceeding 3000 per cubic millimeter. This patient had no specific exposures or risks of such infections. In addition to fungal infections, pulmonary tuberculosis is a consideration, but it has rarely been associated with mild peripheral eosinophilia.[11](#core-r11)\n### Parasitic Infections\n\nGiven this patient\u2019s extensive travel in tropical and subtropical regions, parasitic infection is a major consideration in this case.[12](#core-r12) Helminths can cause peripheral eosinophilia as they migrate through or invade tissue, and the degree of eosinophilia can vary during the life cycle of the parasite.Several helminthic infections are associated with clinically significant eosinophilia and cough. Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) occurs approximately 2 to 12 weeks after exposure to organisms in fresh water.[13](#core-r13) After larvae penetrate the skin, they travel through the lungs and circulation, causing a sudden onset of fever, cough, urticarial rash, migratory infiltrates on chest radiography, and peripheral eosinophilia. Symptoms typically resolve spontaneously after 2 to 10 weeks. Schistosoma species that cause disease in humans are endemic in Asia and the Middle East. This patient did not have many of the presenting features of acute schistosomiasis and his syndrome had lasted longer than 10 weeks, and thus this diagnosis is unlikely.Acute larval migration (Loeffler\u2019s syndrome) is a self-limited illness caused by transpulmonary larval migration that occurs early in the normal life cycle of several helminths, including ascaris, hookworm, and strongyloides. Fever, cough, and urticarial rash begin within 1 to 2 weeks after infection. Marked peripheral eosinophilia can be present, and infiltrates may be seen on chest radiography. The illness lasts days to a few weeks and then symptoms abate; this disease course is not consistent with this patient\u2019s presentation. However, he had a positive serologic test for antibodies to strongyloides, a finding that constitutes evidence of a previous infection. Strongyloidiasis is a common infection, with an estimated 100 million people infected worldwide.[14](#core-r14) Strongyloides can persist for decades, so this patient most likely has chronic strongyloidiasis, which, in the absence of a hyperinfection syndrome, would not explain his cough. The duration of his cough and the absence of other symptoms make acute larval migration unlikely but possible. A negative examination of the stool for ova and parasites does not rule out these diagnoses.A high parasite burden caused by either toxocara or strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome can be associated with marked peripheral eosinophilia and cough due to deposition of larvae or eggs in the lungs. Some patients with acute toxocariasis (visceral larva migrans) have fever, cough, abdominal pain, wheezing, and marked peripheral eosinophilia.[15](#core-r15) Acute toxocariasis is most commonly seen in young children and is acquired through the ingestion of contaminated soil, food, or raw meat. This patient\u2019s age and the absence of other symptoms and known exposures to toxocara make this diagnosis unlikely. Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome occurs in the presence of immunosuppression, particularly glucocorticoid use. This patient had none of the usual risk factors that would suggest strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome.[14](#core-r14)Echinococcus, which is a tapeworm in dogs, can cause lung cysts. This diagnosis is unlikely in this case, given the absence of abnormalities on radiography, the absence of exposure to dogs or livestock, and the magnitude of the eosinophilia.[16,17](#core-r16)Paragonimus is a lung fluke that is transmitted through the ingestion of undercooked or raw freshwater crabs or crayfish. Paragonimiasis is most prevalent in East Asia, with an estimated 23 million people infected worldwide.[18](#core-r18) Pulmonary manifestations include chronic cough, chest pain, and pleural effusion.[11,12](#core-r11) Nearly all infected patients have marked eosinophilia and an elevated IgE level. Chest radiography may show infiltrates, nodules, or pleural effusion, although it can have normal results. The diagnosis is made by means of visualization of the eggs on microscopy of a sputum sample or serologic testing. The sensitivity of microscopy of the sputum is limited even with the use of multiple samples,[11](#core-r11) so a negative examination does not rule out this diagnosis. Serologic testing has a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of more than 95%.[19](#core-r19) On the basis of the negative serologic test for antibodies to paragonimus, paragonimiasis is an unlikely cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms.\n### Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia\n\nTropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) is a hypersensitivity reaction to the filarial parasites *Wuchereria bancrofti* and *Brugia malayi*.[20,21](#core-r20) Lymphatic filariasis affects an estimated 120 million people worldwide,[22](#core-r22) in 83 countries, including most countries in Southeast Asia. Many infected patients have no overt symptoms. TPE is a rare complication of lymphatic filariasis that develops in less than 1% of patients infected by the filarial parasites.[23](#core-r23) The diagnosis of TPE, which is typically made after months of symptoms, is often delayed because of its rarity.[24](#core-r24) TPE is most commonly seen in persons of Indian or Southeast Asian ancestry.[24](#core-r24) Presenting symptoms can include cough (in 90% of patients), dyspnea, wheezing, and interstitial infiltrates or reticulonodular opacities on chest radiography (although results of imaging studies are normal in 20% of patients).Diagnostic criteria include a history of spending time in an area in which the parasites are endemic, a peripheral eosinophil count of more than 3000 per cubic millimeter, a serum IgE level of more than 1000 IU per milliliter, the detection of antifilarial antibodies, and a rapid clinical response to treatment.[20,24](#core-r20) Although this patient\u2019s illness does not perfectly fit the diagnostic criteria, the duration of his symptoms, travel and habitation history, and marked eosinophilia are consistent with TPE. It is important to diagnose and treat TPE, because irreversible restrictive lung disease can develop in affected patients.To establish the diagnosis of TPE, I would perform antibody-based tests for filariasis and examine a peripheral-blood smear for microfilariae. Because it would be difficult to rule out chronic strongyloidiasis in this patient, I would administer empirical ivermectin regardless of the results of additional testing. If the TPE workup is unrevealing, I would obtain a computed tomographic scan of the chest and reconsider primary causes of pulmonary eosinophilic conditions and other helminthic infections.*Dr. Dudzinski:* Dr. Hurtado, what was your clinical impression when you evaluated this patient?*Dr. Rocio M. Hurtado:* The combination of marked peripheral eosinophilia, an elevated serum IgE level in the absence of a hypersensitivity syndrome, and chronic cough in a South Asian man with an extensive travel history raised the possibility of TPE and prompted further investigations for this and other infectious causes. Of note, although TPE is found in less than 1% of patients with filarial infections, it is most commonly found in males from the Indian subcontinent.[25](#core-r25) We were also aware of the patient\u2019s positive serologic test for antibodies to strongyloides, but the chronicity of his symptoms without convincing signs of progressive larval migration or early hyperinfection syndrome prevented us from attributing his presentation exclusively to strongyloidiasis, although we could not fully rule out coinfection with *Strongyloides stercoralis*. We therefore elected to further investigate for lymphatic filariasis, given that we suspected a diagnosis of TPE.\n\nDiagnostic Testing\n------------------\n\n*Dr. K.C. Coffey:* Examination of the stool and sputum for ova and parasites was negative on two occasions. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear for microfilariae was also negative.The patient\u2019s serum was tested for antibodies to schistosoma, strongyloides, and filarial species. Testing for antifilarial antibodies was markedly positive (>510 \u03bcg per milliliter; positive range, >14). In conjunction with the clinical presentation, this finding is most consistent with filarial infection. However, the schistosoma and strongyloides assays were also positive, findings indicative of either cross-reactivity or coinfection.The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for filarial species was performed at the National Institutes of Health. This assay detects IgG4 antibodies to a crude antigen derived from adult *B. malayi*. Extensive cross-reactivity among filarial antigens limits the ability to distinguish among filarial species and other helminths.[26](#core-r26) The assay is unable to discriminate active infection from previous infection (or from chronic exposure in populations who live in areas in which the parasites are endemic). Definitive diagnosis of filarial infection depends on direct detection of microfilariae in the blood. However, examination of a peripheral-blood smear is often negative in patients who present with TPE. This may be due to immunologic hyperresponsiveness, rapid opsonization, and clearance from the peripheral circulation.[20](#core-r20)The ELISA for strongyloides species was performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This test detects IgG antibodies to a crude antigen derived from *S. stercoralis* filariform larvae. The sensitivity of this assay is approximately 95%,[27](#core-r27) but the specificity is reduced by cross-reactivity with filarial species and other nematodes. Although this patient\u2019s positive ELISA for strongyloides could indicate active infection, the test cannot distinguish active infection from previous infection or coinfection with another nematode. The standard method for diagnosis is direct observation of filariform larvae that have been shed in feces (or in sputum in patients with strongyloides hyperinfection). Examination of the stool for parasites was negative on two occasions in this patient. However, only a small number of larvae are shed in the stool, so fecal smears can have low diagnostic sensitivity, even with repeat examinations.[27](#core-r27)The ELISA for schistosoma species was also performed at the CDC. This test detects antibodies to a purified *Schistosoma mansoni* adult microsomal antigen in the presence of schistosoma infection; however, such antibodies might not develop until 6 to 8 weeks after exposure.[28](#core-r28) The test is 99% sensitive for *S. mansoni*, 95% sensitive for *S. haematobium*, and less than 50% sensitive for *S. japonicum*[29](#core-r29); these are the three schistosoma species that most commonly cause infection in humans. A positive test is followed by an immunoblot assay for species identification. Antibodies can persist even after treatment and cannot indicate the degree of infection or the prognosis.[30](#core-r30) In this patient, the ELISA was just within the positive range, and the species-specific immunoblot assay was negative for the three species.Taken together, the serologic test results in this patient were most consistent with microfilarial infection. However, coinfection with strongyloides or schistosoma could not be ruled out.\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Hurtado:* After we received the diagnostic test results, we contacted the CDC to review the case because the patient met criteria for the diagnosis of TPE. Our management approach was centered on the treatment of TPE and other potential coexisting diagnoses, as well as evaluation and surveillance for complications of treatment and of the underlying disease (e.g., restrictive and obstructive lung disease).Although we obtained permission from the CDC for the use of diethylcarbamazine, the main drug for the treatment of lymphatic filariasis, we reviewed the case with additional experts in the field and decided to first treat the patient with a 21-day course of doxycycline. This approach was designed to target wolbachia endosymbionts. Although there has been limited clinical experience with the use of doxycycline in TPE, this medication has a theoretical effect on worm fertility and can modulate and decrease potential adverse effects related to upcoming treatment with diethylcarbamazine.[31](#core-r31) Once the course of doxycycline was completed, the patient was treated with diethylcarbamazine for 14 days. Longer treatment regimens, of up to 4 weeks, have been described.[25](#core-r25)Before the patient received doxycycline and diethylcarbamazine for the treatment of TPE, he had received ivermectin, which also has microfilaricidal effects, for the treatment of strongyloidiasis, as well as praziquantel for the treatment of coexisting schistosomiasis, which had not been ruled out. Before the patient had received antimicrobial therapy, urticaria had developed, and an allergist had determined the urticaria to be of unknown cause. No additional treatment-related complications or adverse events occurred during treatment, and the patient did not receive glucocorticoid therapy during or after treatment. He was screened for restrictive and obstructive lung disease and did not have any clinically significant abnormalities on pulmonary-function testing. His respiratory symptoms completely subsided after therapy, and his peripheral eosinophilia diminished. He ultimately relocated to a different country, and therefore, we have been unable to monitor for disease relapse, which occurs in up to 20% of patients.[32](#core-r32)\n",

      "question": "A seventy-year-old Italian-born woman was admitted to the hospital because of a \"sticking lump\" in the throat.\nThe patient had been well until two weeks before admission, when she began to experience a sensation of \"something in her throat.\" At this time she also noted a swelling in the front of the neck and an irritating, nonproductive cough. Her appetite was good, and she was able to swallow solids with no discomfort. A week before entry she began to suffer respiratory difficulty upon eating solids, and since that time had taken only liquids. Dyspnea became so severe that she could not sleep at night. She gave no history of heat or cold intolerance, palpitation or tremor. The menopause had occurred at the age of fifty-one.\nEight years before admission the patient underwent a panhysterectomy for an adenoacanthoma of the uterus. She had been followed in the Tumor Clinic since that time and had shown no evidence of recurrence.\nPhysical examination revealed a short, stocky, alert woman in moderate respiratory distress. The voice was not hoarse, but the cough was brassy. The facies was suggestive of myxedema, and the general habitus, of cretinism. The fingers were short and stubby. The palpebral fissures were narrow, with epicanthal folds. The skin was dry and leathery. The teeth were in poor repair, and only about half were present. There was a mild right dorsal kyphoscoliosis. In the anterior portion of the neck there was a fixed and stony-hard mass occupying the normal position of the thyroid gland. It dipped into the mediastinum and was surmounted at the left upper pole by a nodule measuring 1.5 by 1 cm. The veins over the upper chest were dilated. In the left paravertebral area near the scapula there were questionable bronchovesicular breath sounds, with no definite widening of the retrosternal dullness. There were no palpable lymph nodes. The heart was not enlarged to the left. The pulmonic second sound was greater than the aortic second sound. There was a Grade II pulmonic systolic murmur. The liver edge was just palpable beneath the right costal border, and in the lower midabdominal region there was an old longitudinal scar. The pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\nThe temperature was 98.6\u00b0F., the pulse 100, and the respirations 32. The blood pressure was 110 systolic, 60 diastolic.\nThe urine was normal. The blood hemoglobin was 10.0 gm., and the white-cell count 10,000, with 83 per cent neutrophils.\nIn the hospital the patient continued to have some respiratory distress. A laryngoscopic examination was negative, showing normal movement of the vocal cords. A roentgenogram of the chest disclosed a large area of density in the upper mediastinal and lower cervical regions, with apparent displacement of the upper trachea and esophagus to the right. There were multiple small areas of calcification in the region of the larynx. The heart and lungs were normal. There was a marked scoliosis of the thoracic spine, with the convexity to the right. Films of the spine and pelvis were normal.\nOn the second hospital day while the patient was eating her evening meal respiratory distress became acute and within a few minutes she became deeply cyanotic and had a rapid, thready pulse. Efforts to pass a Mosher tube were unsuccessful. Tracheotomy was considered inadvisable because of the low position of the thyroid gland. An intratracheal tube was successfully applied by an anesthetist, and an adequate airway permitted stabilization.\nA few hours later an exploration of the neck was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Oliver Cope\\*: The clinical history and description of the physical examination leave no doubt that we are dealing with a large, rapidly growing tumor in the region of the thyroid gland \u2014 that is, in the lower anterior neck, displacing the trachea and, presumably, pressing on, if not displacing, the esophagus. Physical examination revealed some evidence of myxedema, and, of course, that suggests that the lesion involved and had destroyed the secreting thyroid tissue. There is evidence that the trachea was pressing upon the esophagus. Pressure without evidence of laryngeal-cord paralysis is typical of tracheal pressure; there was probably tracheal narrowing. The respiratory distress developing immediately following swallowing and the limitation of swallowing of liquids suggest, in the absence of vocal-cord paralysis, that the act of swallowing caused edema of the neck, the available space already having been taken up by the tumor; in other words, I suspect that there was a sudden rise of venous and lymphatic pressures with the act of swallowing, the edema following. It is possible that when the anesthesist put down the intratracheal tube he observed edema of the vocal cords. It will be recalled that on one day the laryngeal examination was said to be negative, and on the next day acute respiratory difficulties necessitated intubation.The lesion that produced the obstruction is the matter for speculation. We will come to the x-ray studies in a moment in the hope that they will assist in ferreting out the origin of the mass. There are several things to consider. This mass being so rapidly growing, in a patient of the older age group, the commonest lesion is the so-called round-cell carcinoma of the thyroid gland. The patient had had an adenoacanthoma. Is it possible that this was a metastasis? I do not believe I have ever heard of an adenoacanthoma metastasizing to the thyroid gland, but I do not see why it should not. The only metastases I remember were those that might have been the result of direct extension in the abdomen, such as a metastasis to the transverse colon. I am going to dismiss adenoacanthoma because I think it is highly unlikely. Not infrequently, we find metastatic nodules in the thyroid gland from primary growths in other organs, such as the kidney, but I am going to dismiss them also for lack of evidence. The best explanation, as I have said, is the round-cell type of thyroid carcinoma. There are other tumors involving the thyroid gland that could produce this picture. I refer to the tumors developing in the neighboring organs. It is not uncommon for an esophageal tumor to invade the thyroid gland, but I do not remember one as large as this mass is described. We have seen sarcoma from the trachea on two occasions invading thegland; but, again, I do not remember a tumor as large as this, and hemorrhage had been a prominent symptom in both cases.It is possible that this was not a carcinoma but another type of tumor of the thyroid gland. Two will have to be considered: sarcoma and lymphoma. Sarcoma may arise in the stroma or capsule of the thyroid gland, but this is a rare tumor and the patient was a little old for sarcoma. Lymphoma, although very rare, may occur as a primary lesion in the lymphoid tissue of the thyroid gland.When one rules out tumor, there is only one lesion to be considered \u2014 that is, thyroiditis. Acute thyroiditis could cause exactly this picture: a very rapid growth in a few weeks with suffocation. I would not be surprised if Dr. Castleman told me that there was confusion regarding this specimen. Not long ago, in an elderly woman with a comparable history, the initial diagnosis of the Pathology Department was thyroiditis, and the lungs finally turned out to be sarcomatous. I believe that we might meet the same situation in this case. Rapidly growing lesions of the thyroid gland \u2014 thyroiditis, round-cell carcinoma, sarcoma and lymphoma \u2014 may be confused. Before I make my final choice, may we see the x-ray films in the hope that a primary lesion elsewhere, in the esophagus or the trachea, may give us a lead?Dr. Stanley M. Wyman: I think the mass is quite readily visible in the lower neck and in the upper mediastinum displacing and narrowing the trachea very markedly. The esophagus is similarly displaced toward the right. I can see no evidence of intrinsic disease in the esophagus, which is displaced posteriorly as it enters the thorax. The trachea is well seen and very much narrowed, again at the opening of the thorax.Dr. Cope: The constriction is well below the larynx.Dr. Wyman: The lung fields appear clear. The heart shadow is prominent toward the left, and the aorta is tortuous to a degree consistent with the patient's age. The bones show osteoporosis.Dr. Cope: The x-ray films have been helpful in showing the cause of the suffocation, and I shall have to correct a previous statement. The anesthetist may well not have seen edema of the larynx. It would not take much edema for swallowing to cut off the trachea completely. It is narrowed down to almost a slit. The act of swallowing takes up just enough more room in the upper thoracic strait to cut off the trachea. When the trachea is constricted, venous and lymphatic return are also cut off, and edema follows. With repeated swallowing the airway may be endangered by the local collection of edema at the point of tracheal narrowing. The edema may well not have extended up to the larynx itself.Dr. Wyman does not give a clue to the origin of the tumor. One final point: it is said that no lymph nodes were palpable. On the other hand, there was a nodule the size of a lymph node at the left pole. I am not quite clear about that. Lymph-node involvement is the rule in a round-cell carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Of course, the physical examination may not have been accurate, but the absence of lymph-node involvement is presumptive evidence against a diagnosis of a round-cell type of carcinoma. If it is true that there were no lymph nodes, it is more likely that it was one of the rarer sarcomas. In thyroiditis, by the way, there are also enlarged lymph nodes commonly, and they ought to have been palpable. I do not know any way to go about it but to base it on a statistical possibility.The first choice is a round-cell carcinoma, and I would put sarcoma or lymphoma second and thyroiditis third. I do not believe it came from the neighboring organs; I do not think it was primary in the esophagus or trachea.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Benjamin Castleman: This patient was very ill, and it was not believed that she would live after any sort of operation. It was decided to do a tracheotomy anyway, and at the same time some pieces of tumor tissue were biopsied. Everything was adherent in that region. She did poorly and died within a day of operation.On microscopical examination of the biopsy specimen we found areas that were very fibrous and dense that looked for all the world like a Riedel struma, but in other areas there were large spindle-shaped cells, with tumor giant cells and mitoses. As Dr. Cope surmised, there was a difference of opinion in the laboratory about whether we were dealing with true Riedel's struma or very rapidly growing sarcoma. The presence of large numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells scattered throughout the tumor spoke a bit for an inflammatory lesion, but the presence of large tumor giant cells and mitoses swayed us toward the diagnosis of fibrosarcoma. We were not completely satisfied. We thought that if it were a fibrosarcoma, it might have originated in a Riedel Struma, a sequence which I had never heard of before, although we do know that in a fibrosarcoma there may be areas that are dense, fibrous and slowly growing and others, that are rapidly growing.The autopsy proved that this patient had a malignant tumor; there were several metastases in the lung measuring up to 1 cm. in diameter. Here, again, the metastases contained inflammatory cells as well, but there is no doubt that this was a malignant tumor and probably a fibrosarcoma. There are some pathologists who believe that sarcoma rarely if ever occurs in the thyroid gland and that these tumors are epithelial in nature; some are called carcinosarcomas. Some areas of the tumor were pure spindle-shaped cells, especially in the metastases. The tumor had extended into the mediastinum, compressing the neighboring structures but not invading them, which is somewhat in favor of sarcoma rather than carcinoma. An anaplastic carcinoma would tend to invade neighboring structures. This tumor pushed them aside. No regional lymph nodes were involved, which also suggests sarcoma rather than carcinoma.Dr. Cope: I do not remember having seen a case of this type with as much fibrosis.Dr. Castleman: Parts of the tumor were composed of such benign-looking collagen that Dr. Mallory thought that there probably was a pre-existing Riedel struma.\n",

      "question": "A fifty-five-year-old hoist engineer was brought to the hospital by police ambulance because of severe pain in the lower back and sharp precordial pain accentuated by deep breathing.\nOne hour before entry the patient slipped on some grease while at work and fell twenty-five feet into a pit. He landed on the flat of his back on a plank projecting from the floor. He apparently did not strike his head; however, he was \"stunned\" by the fall. He could move his legs freely.\nThe past history was noncontributory.\nPhysical examination revealed a large, well developed man in acute distress. There were obvious signs of shock, and the blood pressure was 70 systolic, 50 diastolic. The left upper quadrant of the abdomen was tympanitic, with very slight tenderness but no spasm. The rest of the abdomen was soft and peristalsis was normal. No masses or organs were palpable. Posteriorly, there was an area of contusion and tenderness over the region of the eighth dorsal vertebra and an area of contusion, tenderness and depression over the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebras. There was bilateral costovertebral-angle tenderness, more marked on the right.\nAs emergency treatment the patient was placed on a Bradford frame, catheterized and given morphine sulfate. Following a transfusion with 1000 cc. of blood, the blood pressure was 95 systolic, 50 diastolic, and the pulse became strong and steady.\nA urine specimen contained many red blood cells. The blood hemoglobin was 14.6 gm. A roentgenogram of the chest taken with a portable machine showed widening of the mediastinal shadow and a probable fracture of the first left rib. A roentgenogram of the spine showed a compression fracture of the body of the seventh dorsal vertebra. There was subluxation of the fourth lumbar vertebra on the fifth and probable fractures of their facets and laminas.\nLater during the day of admission because of persistent tympany over the left upper quadrant, a Levine tube was passed. Approximately 300 cc. of air and 250 cc. of clear fluid with a few flecks of gross blood were removed, with considerable decrease in tympany. On the second hospital day, the abdomen was greatly distended, and the patient vomited small amounts of thick, coffee-ground material. He continued to complain of sharp pain radiating around the left side of the chest, accentuated on breathing. On physical examination at this time the lungs were clear except for a few bronchial rales. The abdomen was tightly distended, with only occasional peristaltic sounds. A large gas bubble was again percussible in the left upper quadrant. The extremities were normal. Seven hundred cubic centimeters of coffee-ground fluid were aspirated by Levine tube. On the fourth hospital day the abdomen was soft, with normal peristalsis. There was slight tenderness in the right upper quadrant. On the same day the patient passed gas by rectum and took 60 cc. of fluid each hour by mouth, with no ill-effects. The blood hemoglobin was 10.9 gm. per 100 cc. and the white-cell count 15,700. The nonprotein nitrogen was 40 mg. per 100 cc. During the next nine days the patient showed marked improvement and was able to take soft solids by mouth. Repeated examinations during this time were negative for any unfavorable change in the patient's condition, and he complained of only slight discomfort on turning in bed. His convalescence seemed to be satisfactory in all respects. The chest pain had markedly diminished. The blood hemoglobin had been brought up to a level of 12.6 gm. per 100 cc. by a third transfusion. The urinary output was normal; the indwelling catheter was removed. Whereas initially the urinary sediment had contained 200 red blood cells per high-power field, only 2 per high-power field were present on the twelfth hospital day. Repeated neurologic and urologic examinations were negative. On the seventeenth hospital day after an unsuccessful attempt to use the bedpan, the patient was seized with severe pain in the left upper quadrant and left lower chest. The blood pressure fell to 95 systolic, 60 diastolic, and the pulse rose to 102 per minute. Shortly thereafter the patient began to perspire profusely. The pain gradually subsided. Examination of the heart and chest was negative. Over the abdomen there was a generalized deep tenderness, particularly on the left side. There were no palpable masses. Peristaltic sounds were present but much reduced. A Levine tube was passed, with essentially no return. During the next twelve hours the blood pressure was maintained at about 110 systolic, 70 diastolic. There was diffuse tenderness, with rebound tenderness over the entire abdomen. Peristalsis persisted but was of low pitch. An exploratory laparotomy was then performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Richard Warren\\*: May we see the x-ray films?Dr. Stanley M. Wyman: All these films are somewhat poor because they were taken while the patient was on a Bradford frame. There are fractures of the bodies of several thoracic vertebras \u2014 namely the fourth and seventh thoracic \u2014 and possibly of several higher vertebras. The changes in the lumbar spine are not impressive. There is nothing else particularly diagnostic except for rather considerable atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta, which I think accounts for the wide mediastinal shadow described in the protocol.Dr. Warren: Do the kidneys look normal?Dr. Wyman: Yes.Dr. Warren: Was no intravenous pyelogram done?Dr. Wyman: I think it was done after the operation.Dr. Warren: No chest plate was taken during the last episode?Dr. Wyman: No.Dr. Warren: I think we will all agree that this patient had a bad fall and that he sustained at that time \"internal injuries,\" as is usually stated in the newspapers, which seventeen days later caused an acute abdominal emergency. As far as I am concerned this could have been caused by an injury to almost anything within the abdomen. I will attempt to analyze the problem by dividing the possible pathologic processes into four categories: rupture of a hollow viscus; rupture of an abscess forming in a large retroperitoneal hematoma, which might have been secondary to the injuries to the lumbar spine or to the obvious injury to the kidney as evidenced by the red cells in the urine; traumatic cyst of the pancreas, liver or cisterna chyli; and finally a recurrent hemorrhage from an injury to a parenchymatous organ like the spleen or kidney.Certain bits of information that I would like to have about the last episode are not given in the record. Did the patient have any fever after the time of the first episode when he was apparently perfectly well, or during the last acute episode?Dr. Charles B. Burbank: No; he had no significant fever at any time. The temperature was always about 99\u00b0F.Dr. Warren: In that last episode, after he went into shock, the blood pressure came back up and there was a twelve-hour wait before operation. Did he get a transfusion to make him respond at this time?Dr. Burbank: Yes.Dr. Warren: I think I will rule out rupture of a hollow viscus. He would have been much sicker, and there would not have been a wait of twelve hours before operation. Furthermore, it is very unusual for this to happen after a delay of seventeen days. With the absence of fever and the absence of signs of generalized peritonitis in the last episode, I can also rule out the intraperitoneal rupture of an abscess. I therefore think I can consider chiefly the differential diagnosis between recurrent hemorrhage from an injured viscus and rupture of a traumatic cyst. The rupture of a pancreatic cyst is a likely possibility. The one difficulty about it is that we know that he did not have any mass. He was apparently examined repeatedly during the days in which he was perfectly well, and unless the mass was well up under the ribs out of the reach of the examining hand, I believe that it would have been felt. It was not felt, and I think on that basis that rupture of a pancreatic cyst is unlikely. How about a chylous cyst, a traumatic cyst of the cisterna chyli? That is very rarely found and is so uncommon that I think it is to be ruled out.What information do we have about the location of the injury that might give us a lead? Clues from this history are quite difficult to evaluate because in the initial episode shortly following trauma the tenderness, such as it was, was more on the right than on the left. With the final episode of definite severe pain in the left upper quadrant and chest, however, we must localize the injury in that region. That pretty well narrows things down to the spleen and left kidney. It is likely that this was a recurrent hemorrhage from one of these two organs. I do not know how to make a differential diagnosis between them. We know he had a kidney injury to begin with, but the absence of symptoms for nine days, the absence of a mass in the flank and the clearing of the urine make late rupture of a renal hematoma unlikely. I think in conclusion I will have to fall back on our much more familiar old friend, delayed rupture of the spleen.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Burbank: Dr. Warren has gone through very much the same steps that we went through in taking care of this patient. We thought from the beginning that he might have a ruptured spleen. He obviously was in advanced shock on admission. Another x-ray finding that might have helped Dr. Warren was the transverse-process fracture, which was not obvious at first but was noted in subsequent films.Because of the multiple injuries we thought it better not to operate upon the patient at the very beginning. We were aware that he might later bleed from the spleen, and when apparently a hemorrhage occurred, we thought that was the most probable source of bleeding and with that diagnosis we did operate on him. He had a large amount of blood in clots and a good deal of blood free within the abdomen. The spleen was enlarged to nearly twice the normal size and was easily removed, and no other source of hemorrhage was found.Dr. Tracy B. Mallory: The spleen showed massive necrosis of a third of the organ, and numerous patches of hemorrhagic necrosis scattered throughout the rest of the organ, quite a characteristic picture of traumatic splenic injury.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Fabian J. Scheid:\nAn 18-year-old male professional athlete was admitted to this hospital because of fevers, abdominal pain, and hematochezia.\nThe patient had been well until 20 days before this admission, when fevers and pain in the right lower quadrant developed during a trip to the southeastern United States for athletic training. One day later, the patient had mild postprandial nausea and loose stools. He presented to a local emergency department for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department of the first hospital, the pulse was 59 beats per minute, the blood pressure 114/65 mm Hg, and the weight 72.1 kg. The results of the rest of the physical examination were not documented. The blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. The results of computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. After 5 hours of observation, the patient was discharged to his hotel without receiving a specific diagnosis.\nDuring the next 2 weeks, the abdominal pain diminished and the fevers and loose stools resolved; mild nausea persisted. The patient traveled with his team to the western United States and participated in reduced-intensity athletic training. Four days before this admission, pain in the right lower quadrant recurred and was associated with low-back pain on the right side. In addition, he produced well-formed stools that contained blood. The following day, the abdominal and back pain persisted. Because the patient had not had a bowel movement, his athletic trainer recommended that he take a rectal suppository. After he took the suppository, he had a bowel movement that consisted of loose stools admixed with blood and mucus. That evening, a temperature of 39.7\u00b0C developed, prompting the patient to present to the emergency department of a second hospital.\nIn the emergency department of the second hospital, the patient reported pain in the right flank and abdomen and loss of appetite. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/76 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The lower quadrants of the abdomen and the right flank were tender; the remainder of the examination was normal. The anion gap and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed mildly distended, fluid-filled loops of small bowel in the left half of the abdomen and the presence of air\u2013fluid levels in the rectum. Acetaminophen and intravenous fluids were administered, and the fever and tachycardia resolved. The team\u2019s internist encouraged the patient to return to New England for further medical evaluation.\nTwo days later and 1 day before this admission, the patient was seen by the team\u2019s internist at an outpatient clinic of this hospital. He reported that the abdominal and back pain persisted. He also reported that, earlier that day, he had had a temperature of 38.9\u00b0C, which had decreased after the administration of acetaminophen, and produced well-formed stools that contained blood. The patient appeared to be uncomfortable. The temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the pulse 84 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds; there was tenderness in the right lower quadrant and the suprapubic region, without guarding, rebound tenderness, or masses. The remainder of the examination was normal. Arrangements were made for an expedited colonoscopy to be performed by a gastroenterologist at this hospital the following afternoon.\nThe next morning, the patient called the team\u2019s internist and reported that, after he had taken the bowel-preparation regimen, he had had a bowel movement that contained a large volume of blood. He also reported shaking chills and fever, with temperatures as high as 39.4\u00b0C, as well as worsening pain in the right lower quadrant. He was advised to present to the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department of this hospital, the patient reported light-headedness and malaise. His medications included ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed, and he had no known allergies. A review of systems was negative for emesis, diarrhea, tenesmus, genitourinary symptoms, arthralgias, rash, and skin and oral ulcerations. The patient was a professional athlete who lived with his family in an urban area of New England and traveled frequently throughout the continental United States. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of autoimmune diseases or inflammatory bowel disease.\nThe patient appeared to be tired. The temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the pulse 122 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 72.3 kg, the height 185 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.1. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds; there was tenderness on palpation of the right lower quadrant and the suprapubic region, without guarding, rigidity, distention, or masses. Examination of the rectum revealed a few external hemorrhoids, and there was scant bright-red blood in the rectal vault; there were no skin tags or palpable fissures or masses. There was no testicular tenderness, warmth, or erythema, but there was an enlarged right inguinal lymph node. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nBlood samples were obtained for culture. Stool samples, which were liquid and bloody, were obtained for culture, examination for ova and parasites, tests for antigens of\nClostridium difficile\nand Shiga toxins 1 and 2, and measurement of the calprotectin level. The anion gap and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Tests for infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and\nHelicobacter pylori\nwere negative. Intravenous fluids were administered, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. On the initial interpretation of the CT scan, no evidence of an acute process in the abdomen or pelvis was detected and the appendix was not visible.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital. That evening, a temperature of 40.2\u00b0C developed, with associated rigors, and the patient appeared to be confused. The pulse was 145 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/52 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. There was a new systolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6) that was best heard at the left upper sternal border; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Another blood sample was obtained for culture. The lactate dehydrogenase level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Cefepime, metronidazole, acetaminophen, and intravenous fluids were administered, and the vital signs and mental status normalized. Ninety minutes after the initiation of treatment, the microbiology laboratory reported that cultures of the blood that had been obtained in the emergency department 11.5 hours earlier had grown gram-negative rods.\nDuring the next day, additional fevers occurred, with temperatures as high as 40.6\u00b0C and with associated rigors. Cultures of the blood that had been obtained in the emergency department grew\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\nand gram-positive cocci, and repeat blood cultures reportedly grew a second type of gram-negative rod.\nA diagnostic test was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nInterpretation of Imaging Studies\n---------------------------------\n\n*Dr. Theodore T. Pierce:* In preparation for this discussion, review of the CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which had been obtained after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed a subtle additional finding that had not been reported to the clinical team at the time of the initial interpretation. There was a possible contained, extraluminal, air-filled collection (20 mm by 10 mm) anterior to the spine, between the sigmoid colon and the right common iliac artery, with adjacent thickening of a short segment of the arterial wall ([Figure 1](#f1)). There was no bowel-wall thickening, bowel distention, or colonic diverticulosis; the appendix was not visible.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Helen M. Shields:* The patient is a previously healthy 18-year-old male professional athlete who presented with fever, pain in the right lower quadrant, loose stools, and nausea. Starting with these symptoms, I will build my differential diagnosis. In doing so, I will try to explain what happened to this young man and why three hospitals in different parts of the country had trouble establishing a diagnosis, even with the use of sophisticated imaging studies. The difficulty in making an imaging-based diagnosis is an additional clue that will help lead me to my final diagnosis.Among patients who present to the emergency department, 5 to 7% have acute abdominal pain.[1,2](#core-r1) Approximately 50% of these patients receive a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis,[3](#core-r3) a condition that is associated with loose stools and nausea, in addition to abdominal pain. Another 25% of the patients receive a diagnosis of a viral or bacterial infection on the basis of results of microbiologic testing.[4](#core-r4) The remaining patients \u2014 including this patient, who presented with pain that was localized to the right lower quadrant \u2014 need to undergo further testing and imaging studies for a diagnosis to be established. What are common causes of pain in the right lower quadrant in a previously healthy 18-year-old man?\n### Appendicitis\n\nIn considering a diagnosis of appendicitis in this patient, I would ask the following questions. Was the pain in the right lower quadrant preceded by epigastric pain, and was it localized to McBurney\u2019s point? Did the patient have a loss of appetite before loose stools and nausea developed? Was there tenderness on gentle palpation of the right lower quadrant, a finding that suggests involvement of the parietal peritoneum? Was the pain exacerbated by coughing or shaking of the bed, which jostles the parietal peritoneum?[1,2](#core-r1) It is notable that the appendix was not visible on this patient\u2019s initial imaging studies; this would be unusual in a patient with appendicitis, in whom the appendix would typically appear thickened and swollen on ultrasonography, as well as on CT and MRI.[5-8](#core-r5)\n### Diverticulitis\n\nCould this patient have diverticulitis? It would be helpful to know the ethnic background of the patient, because Asian patients most commonly have diverticulitis on the right side, in the cecum or ascending colon, whereas North American and European patients most commonly have diverticulitis on the left side, in the sigmoid colon, and present with this condition at an older age.[9,10](#core-r9) Diverticulitis that is located near the sigmoid bend can be associated with pain on the right side. However, this patient\u2019s imaging studies do not show evidence of a diverticulum in the colon or fat stranding, and such a finding would be expected in a patient with an inflammatory process adjacent to the colon, such as diverticulitis.\n### Inflammatory Bowel Disease\n\nDoes the patient have a family history of inflammatory bowel disease? This disease is 3 to 20 times as likely to develop in first-degree relatives of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease as in the general population.[11](#core-r11) A new diagnosis of Crohn\u2019s disease is certainly a possible explanation of this patient\u2019s presentation \u2014 given the rectal bleeding, pain in the right lower quadrant, nausea, and loose stools \u2014 provided that both the colon and the small bowel are involved. However, the imaging studies do not show transmural thickening or inflammation of the bowel, skip lesions, creeping fat, or other hallmarks of Crohn\u2019s disease, such as a fistulous tract.[12](#core-r12) The absence of imaging findings is particularly important in ruling out the diagnosis of Crohn\u2019s disease in this patient. Clinically significant abnormalities on CT (e.g., intraabdominal abscess, stricture, perforation, fistula, and small-bowel obstruction) are detected in 47% of patients in the emergency department who have Crohn\u2019s disease, 81% of whom initially present with abdominal pain.[13](#core-r13)A diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is possible, given the rectal bleeding and mucous discharge. However, the ulcerations associated with ulcerative colitis are mucosal and are very unlikely to give rise to a bowel perforation, unless toxic megacolon develops.[14](#core-r14)\n### Infectious Colitis\n\nInfectious colitis that is due to organisms such as *Salmonella enterica*, *Campylobacter jejuni*, and *Yersinia enterocolitica* should be considered in this case. Stool samples were sent to the laboratory to be tested for salmonella and campylobacter, but there has been no mention of testing for yersinia. The patient had been traveling and presumably eating out for most of his meals, which would put him at risk for an infection. *Y. enterocolitica* is a particularly important consideration in this case, since this organism can cause pain in the right lower quadrant and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. This patient had an enlarged right inguinal lymph node but no other signs of colitis on CT, and his diarrhea subsided spontaneously. In most laboratories, testing for *Y. enterocolitica* must be specifically requested.[15](#core-r15)\n### Colitis Associated with Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs\n\nColitis that is associated with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs should be in the differential diagnosis in this case, given the history of ibuprofen use. How much ibuprofen had the patient been taking? Could the use of ibuprofen have led to the colitis and abdominal pain?[16](#core-r16) It could have led to increased bleeding from ulcerations in the colon.\n### Meckel\u2019s Diverticulum\n\nMeckel\u2019s diverticulum with perforation is a compelling diagnosis in this case, given this patient\u2019s young age. However, Meckel\u2019s diverticulum with perforation usually occurs in early childhood.[17](#core-r17) In addition, the imaging studies do not show evidence of this specific small-bowel condition, except for the dilated loops of small bowel on MRI of the abdomen at the second hospital, a finding that suggests partial small-bowel obstruction or ileus.\n### Ischemic Colitis\n\nIschemic bowel disease is a rare and serious condition that causes lower gastrointestinal bleeding and has been described in marathon runners.[18](#core-r18) In athletes, reversible ischemic bowel disease involving the cecum and ascending colon, with associated pain on the right side, may be due to physiological shunting caused by splanchnic vasoconstriction or to intravascular volume depletion, or it may result from other factors.[18](#core-r18)\n### Sigmoid or Cecal Volvulus\n\nVolvulus, which is a twist in the large bowel, accounts for 10 to 15% of cases of large-bowel obstruction.[19](#core-r19) Sigmoid volvulus is more common than cecal volvulus. This patient\u2019s imaging studies do not show evidence of a twist in the bowel.\n### Colon Cancer\n\nColon cancer in the ascending colon or cecum with perforation should be in the differential diagnosis in this case, even though the patient is only 18 years old. Given the rising incidence of colon cancer among young people in the United States,[20](#core-r20) this diagnosis must be ruled out. Although this patient\u2019s imaging studies do not show a mass lesion or evidence of a perforating cancer, the use of CT colonography or colonoscopy would provide a more accurate assessment for a mass lesion in the colon.\n### Right Inguinal Hernia\n\nThe risk of an inguinal hernia with intermittent incarceration, which can lead to ischemic bowel, may be increased in athletes. However, this patient\u2019s imaging studies do not show evidence of a hernia, and a targeted physical examination and ultrasonography of the groin have not been mentioned.\n### Foreign Body\n\nI think that perforation of the large bowel by a foreign body is the most likely diagnosis in this case, given the slow tempo of the disease course, imaging findings, and baffling clinical picture.[21-33](#core-r21) Since the history does not provide any clues about what may have pierced the bowel to cause a perforation, I would ask the patient to describe what he had eaten before the onset of abdominal pain.[23-30](#core-r23) I would specifically ask whether he had eaten any fish with bones; chicken wings or other bone-in chicken parts; shellfish such as crabs, lobsters, or mussels; or sandwiches held together with toothpicks, such as a turkey club.[19,20,24\u201329](#core-r19) The diagnosis of perforation by a foreign body makes the most sense in this case because it is the only cause of bowel perforation that is associated with both the absence of imaging findings and the absence of an inflamed-appearing bowel at the site where the perforation has occurred.[19,20](#core-r19)Two weeks after the initial episode of pain occurred in this young athlete, he had a repeat episode that was accompanied by back pain. In retrospect, this new pain was most likely associated with the development of an abscess, which could explain the findings on the CT scan obtained in the emergency department of this hospital. It is likely that the contained, extraluminal, air-filled collection adjacent to the sigmoid colon is located at the site of perforation and is the cause of polymicrobial sepsis. However, the patient probably also had an arterioenteric fistula[34-37](#core-r34) between the sigmoid colon and the right common iliac artery that was caused by penetration of the vessel by a foreign body.[34](#core-r34) On the CT scan, the right common iliac artery has a distinctly abnormal-appearing vessel wall. These complications of perforation by a foreign body \u2014 an abscess and a fistulous connection to the right common iliac artery with resulting hemorrhage into the bowel and polymicrobial sepsis \u2014 would explain all the symptoms and signs in this young man.[34](#core-r34)Patients with perforation by a foreign body are usually unable to remember ingesting the foreign body.[24-28](#core-r24) Most ingested foreign bodies pass without consequence, but 10 to 20% need to be removed endoscopically and 1% surgically. In this case, I would recommend drainage of the abscess adjacent to the sigmoid colon, evaluation for an arterioenteric fistula involving the right common iliac artery, and surgical correction of the perforated area of the sigmoid colon.\n\nFollow-up\n---------\n\n*Dr. Scheid:* The patient did well after surgery and was discharged on the 10th hospital day, 6 days after the second surgery. At the time of discharge, he was able to walk without assistance. He completed a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin along with oral metronidazole and fluconazole and then received a 4-week course of cefpodoxime and metronidazole. At the direction of the team\u2019s internist, additional follow-up was arranged with the physical therapy, vascular surgery, general surgery, and infectious disease services.*Dr. Scott D. Martin:* Once the patient\u2019s condition had stabilized, we were able to safely tailor the rehabilitation program with the goal of restoring his elite athlete status. The first stage of his recovery involved a low-impact program with walking on level ground. After 6 weeks, he progressed to aqua therapy and exercise on a stationary bike as his vascular and intestinal anastomoses healed. The second stage involved a gradual increase in resistance. The third stage involved a higher-impact program with jogging, weight training, and intermittent sprinting. As the patient\u2019s endurance and strength improved, he was advanced to sport-specific activities. The final stages involved light, controlled training with select teammates. After a final evaluation in which he received clearance from the team\u2019s internist and subspecialists, he was allowed to participate in training and competitive play. Seven months after his injury, he played in his first professional game, and he continues to have a substantial role in his sport.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Jeffrey S. Ustin\n(Trauma, Emergency Surgery, and Surgical Critical Care): A 26-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal distention and shock.\nThe patient had been well until the evening before admission, when mild abdominal pain developed, shortly after he had eaten five or six frankfurters. The pain gradually increased overnight, and nausea developed the next day. In the evening of the day of admission, his parents found him unresponsive, with coffee-grounds material emanating from his mouth. They called emergency medical services. On examination, he was obtunded, with agonal respirations. The trachea was intubated without medications, and supplemental oxygen was administered by means of an anesthesia bag attached to the endotracheal tube; the patient was transported to another hospital. On examination in the emergency department, the femoral pulse rate was 150 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute; the blood pressure could not be measured. Twenty-two minutes after arrival, during insertion of a central intravenous catheter, the patient became pulseless, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was begun. Within 12 minutes, the blood pressure was 87/70 mm Hg and compressions were stopped. Screening of the urine for toxins was negative. Laboratory-test results are shown in\nTable 1\nand\nTable 2\n. He began to awaken, and fentanyl and vecuronium were administered. A nasogastric tube was inserted, and brown material (200 to 300 ml) was aspirated. Levofloxacin and metronidazole were administered intravenously. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis reportedly showed markedly dilated loops of bowel, without free air or evidence of obstruction or volvulus, and CT scans of the chest and head were normal.\nTwo hours 40 minutes after arrival, the patient was transferred to this hospital by helicopter. The blood pressure during transfer ranged between 79 and 116 mm Hg systolic and between 34 and 50 mm Hg diastolic, and the pulse was 125 beats per minute. Four intravenous catheters were in place. The patient arrived at this hospital 47 minutes later.\nThe patient's history was obtained from his family. The patient had had increasing abdominal distention during the past several weeks. He had not had diarrhea. One month before admission, at the time of his annual physical examination, mild lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 123,000 per cubic millimeter) had been noted. Urinalysis had been normal. At follow-up testing performed 4 days before admission, the platelet count was 132,000 per cubic millimeter; the white-cell and differential counts were normal. A diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia was made at the age of 16 years. The patient had been poorly compliant with medications in the past and had been an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital for the past 3 years, staying at his parents' home on the weekends, where he was when he became ill. He had had fractures of the fourth and fifth metacarpals of the right hand in fights several years earlier and had been bitten by a dog in the past. Medications included clozapine (550 mg), valproic acid (2250 mg), and glycopyrrolate (4 mg) orally at night. He had no known allergies to medications. He smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol and did not use illicit drugs. He was single, had completed the 11th grade, had worked outdoors in the past, and was currently unemployed. His brother also had schizophrenia. There was no family history of other mental illness, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, gastrointestinal disease, or nephrolithiasis.\nOn examination, the patient was sedated, intubated, ventilated, and unresponsive to painful stimuli. The blood pressure was 57/41 mm Hg, the pulse 127 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing 100% oxygen. The pupils were round, 6 mm in diameter, and equal, and they reacted sluggishly to light, with an absence of corneal reflexes. The neck was supple, lung sounds were normal, and no cardiac murmurs were heard. The abdomen was rigid and distended, with tympany. The legs were cold and pale, but the skin was not mottled. The radial pulse was weakly palpable, and pedal or femoral pulses were absent. Laboratory-test results are shown in\nTable 1\nand\nTable 2\n. An electrocardiogram showed tachycardia (133 beats per minute) that was thought to be of sinus origin, right-axis deviation, and an intraventricular conduction defect. Intravenous fluids, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine were administered; the blood pressure rose to 120/86 mm Hg. Vancomycin was added, and levofloxacin and metronidazole were continued.\nThirty minutes after the patient's arrival at this hospital, a procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Hasan B. Alam:* May we review the radiologic studies?*Dr. Alexander S.R. Guimaraes:* Contrast-enhanced CT images of the abdomen and pelvis from the other hospital ([Figure 1](#f01)) show diffuse distention of the entire colon. There is fecal material throughout the colon and in the distal small bowel, which is not distended. There is mild thickening of the wall of the colon, and there is flattening of the inferior vena cava, a finding that suggests either increased abdominal pressure or low intravascular volume.*Dr. Alam:* Abdominal distention is a common finding that can occur in a variety of gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic disorders. The underlying causes can be categorized on the basis of whether the distention is caused by gas or fluid ([Figure 2](#f02)). These categories are not mutually exclusive \u2014 paralytic ileus or bowel obstruction may be associated with accumulation of blood or ascites in the peritoneal cavity, and intestinal perforation can cause spillage of enteric contents into the abdomen. In practice, the approach to the differential diagnosis is driven by the physiological status of the patient and the lethality of the underlying disease. If the patient is stable (not in shock), imaging techniques, such as CT, can be used to establish a diagnosis, whereas in an unstable patient such as this one, therapeutic interventions are urgently required, often without an opportunity to use sophisticated diagnostic tests.This patient has acute dilatation of the colon in the absence of mechanical obstruction, a condition known as acute megacolon (Ogilvie's syndrome). He also has thickening of the wall of the colon, which suggests inflammation, and septic shock with multiple organ failure; the combination of colonic distention (>6 cm in diameter) associated with inflammation of the colon and septic shock is known as toxic megacolon.[1,2](#core-r001) In a young patient, the most common cause of toxic megacolon is inflammatory bowel disease, which this patient did not have. The other leading cause \u2014 often not associated with diarrhea \u2014 is colitis due to *Clostridium difficile*. However, *C. difficile* colitis usually occurs in patients who are taking multiple antibiotics \u2014 again, not the case in this patient.In addition to colonic distention, shock, and organ failure, this patient had a distended and rigid abdomen and increased peak airway pressures. These findings are consistent with an abdominal compartment syndrome, defined as a sustained intraabdominal pressure above 20 mm Hg (with or without an abdominal perfusion pressure below 60 mm Hg) that is associated with organ dysfunction or failure.[3,4](#core-r003) This condition is being recognized with increasing frequency in critically ill patients, including those with septic shock,[5](#core-r005) and has been identified as an independent predictor of death in such patients.[6](#core-r006)\n### The Lethal Triad and Damage-Control Surgery\n\nFinally, this patient also had coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia \u2014 an ominous trio of signs in trauma patients that has been called the \u201clethal triad.\u201d[7](#core-r007) These factors perpetuate one another, creating a vicious cycle that is difficult to interrupt.[8](#core-r008) Early development of coagulopathy is a well-recognized marker of the severity of an injury, and its presence is associated with a significantly increased risk of death.[9\u201311](#core-r009) In this critically ill patient with megacolon, an abdominal compartment syndrome, and the lethal triad, no further diagnostic evaluation was performed, and he was taken directly to the operating room. At laparotomy, we found massive distention of the entire colon (maximum diameter, >15 cm), without evidence of perforation ([Figure 3](#f03)). The rectum and small bowel appeared to be hypoperfused but viable, except for a small segment of terminal ileum. We removed the entire colon and a small segment of terminal ileum, leaving a segment of rectum.The patient had hypothermia, acidosis, and diffuse bleeding during the operation, prompting the surgical team to opt for a damage-control strategy. The term \u201cdamage control\u201d originated in the U.S. Navy and referred to the ability of a ship to absorb damage while continuing to perform its mission.[12](#core-r012) Damage-control laparotomy is widely practiced today in severely injured patients with trauma.[13](#core-r013) The basic concept is to perform an abbreviated operation, focusing on controlling hemorrhage and contamination. This initial operation is followed by a period of resuscitation in the intensive care unit (ICU) to reverse the lethal triad of acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy. The patients are taken back to the operating room for a definitive operation once the physiological disturbances have been corrected. Although used primarily for severely injured patients, this approach is equally useful for other critically ill patients who need an operation, such as this one.After the terminal ileum and colon were removed, we did not try to perform an anastomosis of the bowel, perform an ileostomy, or close the abdominal fascia. Instead, the stapled ends of the bowel (ileum and rectum) were returned to the abdomen, the fascia was left open to prevent an increase in intraabdominal pressure, and a temporary vacuum-assisted abdominal closure was performed, involving the use of plastic sheets, towels, suction drains, and adhesive plastic dressing.[14](#core-r014) The patient was then taken to the ICU for correction of his acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia.\n### Early, Goal-Directed Resuscitation\n\nEarly, goal-directed resuscitation has been shown to lower the mortality rate among patients with sepsis and shock.[15\u201317](#core-r015) For optimal results, the resuscitation protocol must be initiated as soon as a diagnosis of shock is made, not delayed until admission to the ICU. This concept is at the core of evidence-based recommendations for the resuscitation of patients with sepsis.[18](#core-r018) Early, goal-directed resuscitation was begun when this patient arrived in the emergency department and continued throughout the operation and during the next few days.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Lawrence R. Zukerberg:* The removed segment of colon was dilated, ranging from 15 to 18 cm in diameter, and filled with bloody fecal material. The wall was thin, ranging from 0.3 to less than 0.1 cm in thickness, and was red and dusky, without evidence of perforation. A 50-cm-long segment of distal ileum had a wall thickness of approximately 0.3 cm.On histological examination, the colonic mucosa showed coagulative necrosis with hemorrhage, loss of crypts, and basal regeneration of the remaining crypts, features that are consistent with ischemic damage ([Figure 3](#f03)). The necrosis and hemorrhage were confined to the mucosa, without involvement of the submucosa or muscularis. The segment of ileum showed similar mucosal changes. There was no evidence of acute inflammation, pseudomembranes, or vascular thrombi. These features are consistent with the diagnosis of acute megacolon (Ogilvie's syndrome).\n### Acute Megacolon (Ogilvie's Syndrome)\n\nAcute megacolon that occurs in association with underlying inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease or *C. difficile* disease, is known as toxic megacolon.[19,20](#core-r019) In the absence of colonic inflammation, the diagnosis is acute megacolon, also known as Ogilvie's syndrome. Because of the absence of evidence of colitis, the diagnosis of toxic megacolon can be ruled out in this case. Although the mucosal necrosis has features of ischemic necrosis, the absence of transmural necrosis or distribution according to a pattern of arterial or venous supply makes a primary vascular cause unlikely.The cause of the ischemic necrosis in massively dilated intestinal segments is related to Pascal's principle and Laplaces's law. Pascal's principle states that the pressure within a cylindrical structure is the same, regardless of whether the structure is dilated, and Laplace's law states that the wall tension of a cylinder is equal to the pressure within the cylinder multiplied by the radius. Therefore, a dilated intestinal segment has a greater wall tension than a nondilated segment; if the dilatation and tension are sufficiently great, blood flow may be obstructed and ischemia of the bowel will occur.Acute megacolon develops because of abnormal intestinal motility. Normal colonic motility requires integration of myogenic, neural, and hormonal influences. The enteric nervous system[21](#core-r021) is independent but is connected to the central nervous system by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The targets of the enteric neurons are muscle cells, secretory cells, endocrine cells, microvasculature, and inflammatory cells. The neurons in the enteric plexuses are stimulated by a food bolus, which both distends the gut and stimulates the mucosal surface, leading to the release of factors that stimulate interneurons. The stimulated interneurons transmit excitatory signals proximally, which cause contraction and inhibitory signals distally, and these in turn cause relaxation. These signals are transmitted by the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and serotonin, among others.This patient was taking clozapine, a drug that has both anticholinergic and antiserotonergic properties, which can cause severe gastrointestinal motility problems, including massive colonic dilatation and acute megacolon.[22\u201324](#core-r022) Pathological features of reported cases are similar to those seen in this case, with involvement of the right side or the entire colon and ischemic mucosal necrosis, which may be associated with perforation if the diameter of the colon exceeds 12 cm.*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): Dr. Fricchione, can you comment on the likelihood that this patient's acute megacolon was due to clozapine?\n### Clozapine-Induced Gastrointestinal Hypomotility\n\n*Dr. Gregory L. Fricchione:* This man's psychiatric illness is marked by an early onset (at the age of 16 years), inpatient commitment in the state-hospital system for 3 years, and trials of many antipsychotic medications, suggesting treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia. Most recently, he had been treated with clozapine (550 mg per day), valproate (2250 mg per day), and glycopyrrolate (4 mg per day).Since the 1950s, drugs that antagonize the dopamine D2 receptors, such as chlorpromazine, other phenothiazines, and butyrophenones such as haloperidol \u2014 so-called typical antipsychotic agents \u2014 have been important in the management of schizophrenia.[25](#core-r025) However, although they are effective antipsychotic agents, their dopamine-receptor antagonism also leads to extrapyramidal side effects, prompting a search for alternative antipsychotic approaches.[26,27](#core-r026) Clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine compound with antiserotonergic properties and a relatively low affinity for D2; in 1958, it became the first of a class of atypical antipsychotic agents characterized by reduced extrapyramidal side effects. There are now five other atypical antipsychotic agents in this category: risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole.Although it was an effective antipsychotic agent, clozapine was found in some patients to cause neutropenia (3%) and agranulocytosis (0.8%) and was taken off the market in 1975.[25](#core-r025) However, it was later shown to be more effective than chlorpromazine for the treatment of resistant schizophrenia[28](#core-r028) and to reduce the mortality rate by decreasing the suicide rate. This led to its reintroduction as a non\u2013first-line treatment, with required hematologic monitoring of white cells and the absolute neutrophil count. Clozapine can also have other side effects besides neutropenia and agranulocytosis, including delirium, seizures, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, venous thromboembolism, hypersalivation, weight gain, the metabolic syndrome, sedation, hypotension, and tachycardia. Constipation is very common, occurring in 14 to 60% of patients. [23](#core-r023)Recently, a syndrome of clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility was described,[23](#core-r023) with an estimated prevalence of 0.3% and a mortality rate of 27.5%. Risk factors include high doses of clozapine; increased clozapine plasma levels due to medical illness, fever, or coadministration of the cytochrome P-450 inhibitors fluoxetine and fluvoxamine; concomitant use of anticholinergic medications or other hypomotility inducers such as opiates; and a history of gastrointestinal disease and bowel surgery. Obesity, a low-fiber diet, dehydration, hypersalivation, and diaphoresis may lower the threshold for constipation and its more serious outcomes.[23](#core-r023)This patient's clozapine dose was 550 mg per day \u2014 higher than the mean dose in the reported cases of clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility (428 mg per day) and higher than the dose for those who died (535 mg per day). Our patient was also receiving an anticholinergic medication (glycopyrrolate), presumably for clozapine-induced hypersalivation, and was also taking valproate, which can cause a minor increase in clozapine metabolites.[29](#core-r029) We do not know exactly how long the patient had been taking clozapine, but it was at least several months and possibly more than a year. In the reported cases, 20% of cases of clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility developed within 1 month after the start of treatment with clozapine, 36% within 4 months, and more than 50% within the first year.Serious complications usually develop in patients with clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility between 6 hours and 4 weeks after initial reports of problems. This patient had abdominal distention for several weeks and then acute symptoms on the evening before admission. Patients with schizophrenia may have a higher pain threshold than other patients, as well as difficulty in expressing pain.[30](#core-r030) Psychotropic medications themselves may cause sedation and anti-nociception. A combination of these factors may delay the diagnosis, as they probably did in this case.Before clozapine is administered, preexisting constipation should be treated, and education about diet, food intake, dehydration, and exercise should be provided. Regular weekly screening during the first 4 months of clozapine treatment is advised, with attention to constipation, a change in bowel habits, and abdominal girth.[23](#core-r023) This case, in which gastrointestinal complications developed at least several months after the start of treatment with clozapine, suggests that the screening period should probably be extended. Avoidance of concomitant medications that can cause constipation, such as opiates and anticholinergic medications, is recommended. The gradual development of abdominal distention in this patient, in the context of the administration of clozapine and glycopyrrolate, should have prompted consideration of discontinuation of these medications. This case highlights the morbidity and mortality associated with clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility and the importance of screening.\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Harris:* I would like to ask Drs. Ustin and Fernandez-Robles, who cared for this patient on the Surgical and Psychiatry services, respectively, to tell us how the patient's care was managed and how he is doing.*Dr. Ustin:* The patient required many additional operations, including resection of ischemic ileum, creation of an ileostomy, delayed abdominal closure, drainage of an intraabdominal hematoma, and placement of a tracheostomy tube. He had profound multisystem organ failure with septic shock, a peak lactate level of 24 mmol per liter, liver failure with a total bilirubin level of 44 mg per deciliter (752 \u03bcmol per liter), renal failure requiring 2 months of renal-replacement therapy, and respiratory failure requiring 2 months of mechanical ventilation. Approximately 1 week into his hospitalization, he had received 55 units of packed red cells, 70 units of platelets, and 134 units of fresh-frozen plasma for severe coagulopathy and bleeding. Because of gastrointestinal dysfunction and the short-gut syndrome, he required parenteral nutrition. Pulmonary mucormycosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia developed and required placement of an inferior vena cava filter during the postoperative period.Ultimately, after 4 months on the surgical service, the patient's renal and kidney function returned to normal and he was weaned from the ventilator and transitioned to tube feeding and then to an oral diet. He was ambulatory and gaining weight and was transferred to the psychiatry service for management of schizophrenia.*Dr. Carlos Fernandez-Robles* (Psychiatry): When I saw this patient for the first time, he was still in the ICU, intubated and sedated and not requiring antipsychotic medications. Once his medical condition stabilized, treatment with olanzapine (10 mg per day) was begun; while he was in the ICU, he received all required doses of this medication, and his psychosis was well controlled. After his transfer to the regular surgical ward, he began refusing psychiatric medications, and his psychiatric problems recurred.His behavior was oppositional, and he refused essential medications and procedures, including the administration of intravenous fluids. For this reason, a motion for temporary guardianship, accompanied by a medical certificate, and a Rogers guardianship were filed 12 weeks into this hospitalization and received court approval at approximately week 15. A Rogers guardianship supplements regular guardianship when it is deemed necessary for safety reasons to give psychiatric medications against a patient's will. The patient's father is the current Rogers guardian and legal guardian. Six months after the patient's admission, the temporary guardianship that we filed for was extended by 90 days, because he was still on our psychiatric unit.This has been a very challenging case for us. Clozapine is reserved for cases in which several trials of antipsychotic agents have been unsuccessful, and it was the one medication that seemed to control this patient's psychosis. Severe clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility developed, but after his colon was removed, we thought it would be safe to offer him this drug again. Unfortunately, he refuses to take it because it had caused acute megacolon. Although his father could order it under the terms of the Rogers guardianship, he has declined to do so. We first started a trial of olanzapine (10 to 20 mg daily for 17 weeks), with insufficient response. We then switched to risperidone, and the dose was increased to 8 mg per day, which is the higher end of the therapeutic dosage range. Most recently, aripiprazole (5 mg) was added. Within the past month, he also received a trial of ziprasidone because of a persistently irritable mood, but it was discontinued because it was ineffective.During the patient's stay in the psychiatric unit, additional medical problems were addressed: tachycardia, anemia, renal failure, hypercalcemia, and physical deconditioning. His medical condition stabilized, and he became independent in activities of daily living. He continued to display guarded, paranoid behavior and did not acknowledge that he had any psychiatric condition. An oral, dissolving preparation of risperidone (Risperdal M-Tabs) was required, to prevent him from spitting out the medication. He was transferred to a state hospital after a total of 6 months in this hospital. Three months later, he was discharged to a halfway house. His psychiatric symptoms are reasonably well controlled with risperidone and oxcarbazepine. The colostomy was reversed 6 months after discharge, 13 months after his initial admission to this hospital.\n",

      "question": "A 47-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of severe back pain and an osteosclerotic lesion of the 11th thoracic vertebral body.\nThe patient was well until 11 weeks earlier, when she lifted a 9-kg bag of seed. On the next day back pain developed and worsened. Three days later she was seen at another hospital, where a diagnosis of back strain was made and naproxen and acetaminophen\u2014codeine were prescribed. One week later the pain improved, and the patient returned to work.\nDuring the next 5 weeks mild pain persisted and then worsened 31 days before admission. On the next day the patient consulted her physician, who obtained laboratory studies, including x-ray films of the spine. Cyclobenzaprine and acetaminophen\u2014codeine were prescribed; the patient subsequently substituted ibuprofen for the latter medication. Two weeks later the back pain became so severe that she returned to the same hospital and was sent home after receiving an injection of meperidine. Two weeks before admission she consulted a second physician, who prescribed prednisone and acetaminophen\u2014codeine. Ten days before admission, radionuclide bone scanning, performed elsewhere, revealed a solitary focus of increased uptake of radionuclide in the 11th thoracic vertebra (T11), predominantly on the left side. X-ray films of the thoracic spine (\nFig. 1\n) showed an osteosclerotic abnormality in the body of T11. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the thoracic spine (Fig. 2), performed with T\n1\n-weighted images, disclosed a focus of decreased signal in the left half of the T11 vertebral body, next to the subjacent disk; there was a rounded focus of bright signal in the right half of T11 adjacent to the area of low signal; a second similar bright area was present in the posterior part of T9. Because of increasing severity of the back pain that interfered with ambulation, the patient was admitted to the same hospital. Physical examination was negative except for moderate tenderness over the lower thoracic spine on the left side and increased back pain on passive straight-leg raising, more prominent on the right side. The reflexes were ++ and equal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 40 mm per hour. A urinalysis and complete blood count were normal except that the white-cell count was 15,400, with a normal differential count. An automated scan of blood chemical values was normal, and a test for carcinoembryonic antigen was negative; serum immunoelectrophoresis disclosed no M component. An x-ray film of the chest was normal. X-ray films of the thoracic spine revealed an ill-defined sclerotic lesion of the left half of T11, and there was dense calcification of the nucleus pulposus of the T11\u201312 intervertebral disk. Bilateral mammographic examinations, a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, a CT scan of the thorax, an upper gastrointestinal series with small-bowel study, and a barium-enema examination were negative. Oxycodone\u2014acetaminophen was administered, with partial relief of the pain. The patient was able to ambulate briefly in a walker but experienced severe pain after short intervals out of bed. The patient was transferred to this hospital.\nThere was a history of pulmonary embolism 17 years earlier, which was treated with an inferior-vena-cava clip. The patient was employed in a florist's shop. She had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 26 years and consumed alcohol infrequently. The menopause occurred five years before admission. Her father died of carcinoma of the lung, and her mother died in a motor vehicle accident; three sisters were in an unknown state of health.\nThe temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse was 76, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg.\nOn physical examination the patient appeared well. The head, neck, lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. Abdominal examination was negative except for a midline abdominal scar. There was minimal tenderness over the lower dorsal spine, without paraspinal spasm. The extremities were normal. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative. Neurologic examination was negative except that the patient experienced pain on straight-leg raising.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 39.5 percent; the white-cell count was 8900, with 57 percent neutrophils, 35 percent lymphocytes, 3 percent monocytes, 4 percent eosinophils, and 1 percent basophils; the platelet count was 381,000. The prothrombin time was 9.6 seconds, with a control of 10.9 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 30.7 seconds. The urea nitrogen was 4.3 mmol per liter (12 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 4.8 mmol per liter (87 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 2.5 mmol per liter (9.8 mg per 100 ml), and the phosphorus 1.6 mmol per liter (5.0 mg per 100 ml). The sodium was 140 mmol, the potassium 4.1 mmol, the chloride 103 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 28.7 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) was 34 U (new normal for a woman, 9 to 25), the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 177 U (new normal, 110 to 210), and the alkaline phosphatase 95 U per liter (new normal for a woman, 30 to 100). The thyroxine was 95 nmol per liter (7.4 \u03bcg per 100 ml), and the total triiodothyronine 1.8 nmol per liter (116 ng per 100 ml); the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 2.6 \u03bcU per milliliter (new normal, 0.5 to 5.0). An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 59, with inversion of the T waves in Leads V\n1\nand V\n2\n, believed to be consistent with a normal variant, and was otherwise normal. A CT scan of the thoracic spine (\nFig. 3\n) demonstrated ill-defined sclerosis of the left half of the T11 vertebral body; a rounded radiolucency, 1 cm, was present in the right half of T11, contiguous with but not surrounded by the zone of sclerosis; there was dense calcification of the T11\u2013T12 intervertebral disk, and a lesser amount of calcification was visible within the T12\u2013L1 intervertebral disk. A radionuclide bone scan, performed after the intravenous injection of\n99m\nTc methylene diphosphonate, revealed a focal area of increased activity that involved the 11th thoracic vertebral body, slightly lateralized to the left side; in the remainder of the skeleton there was a normal distribution of radioactivity, and symmetric renal activity was noted. Oxycodone\u2014acetaminophen was administered.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Stephen J. Lipson\\*: This apparently well 47-year-old woman sustained back pain on heavy lifting that worsened progressively in the next three months. The exact site of the back pain is not specified, but it appeared to be the lower thoracic spine, as indicated by the localized tenderness found on physical examination. There were no neurologic symptoms and no neurologic abnormalities on examination. The finding of pain on passive straight-leg raising usually implicates a lesion within the cauda equina, but the location of the pain was not specified beyond the statement that it was in the back. The general physical examination revealed no evidence of a malignant tumor or other disease, and the laboratory examination did not reveal any abnormality except for a slightly elevated sedimentation rate. The remainder of the evaluation centered on the radiologic findings, which I should like to review at this time.\\*Orthopedic surgeon, Brigham and Women's Hospital; associate clinical professor of orthopaedic surgery, Harvard Medical School.Dr. Daniel I. Rosenthal: A radioisotope bone scan demonstrates a solitary focus of increased uptake on the left side of T11. A radiographic survey ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows several calcified intervertebral disks. Calcification of the posterior half of the T11\u2013T12 disk is especially dense. The posterior half of the T11 vertebral body appears minimally sclerotic.The MRI scan ([Fig. 2](#f002)) shows the calcified disk material as an area of low-signal intensity in the posterior part of the T11\u2013T12 disk space. The sclerotic portion of the bone is represented by a focus of low-signal intensity contiguous with the defect in the end plate. A rounded area of very bright signal intensity is seen in the right half of T11. A bright signal intensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images suggests either fat or recent hemorrhage.A CT scan through the T11\u2013T12 disk ([Fig. 3](#f003)) demonstrates flocculent opacities representing the densely calcified disk. In addition, it shows a defect in the inferior end plate of T11 and a contiguous lucent area surrounded on its cranial surface by an ill-defined zone of faint sclerosis occupying the left half of the vertebral body. This finding corresponds to the findings on the bone scan and plain films. A second spherical lucent area is seen in the right half of the vertebral body, corresponding to the bright area shown on the MRI scan. It has sharp margins, is not calcified, and is not surrounded by sclerosis.Dr. Lipson: Three radiologic abnormalities require evaluation \u2014 the ill-defined, sclerotic lesion of the left half of T11, the calcification of the T11\u2013T12 intervertebral disk, and the radiolucent lesion of the right half of T11 contiguous with the sclerotic lesion. At least one and possibly two of these abnormalities were probably not pathologic lesions that caused the clinical problem. Disk calcification in adults is most frequent in the thoracolumbar spine, found in 5 to 6 percent of adults in radiographic surveys and in up to 70 percent of adults on postmortem examination, most often in the midthoracic and lower thoracic spine.[1](#core-r001) Calcification of a disk is usually asymptomatic, but when it causes symptoms they are usually on the basis of nerve compression, which was not present in this case. The calcific deposits are most frequently hydroxyapatite and may be associated with hyperparathyroidism, hypervitaminosis D, acromegaly, and ochronosis as well as disk degeneration. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition is less common and is usually found at multiple levels. It is associated with gout, hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, familial chondrocalcinosis, and degenerative disk disease. There is no evidence of a metabolic source of calcification in this patient, and I shall conclude that the calcification was on the basis of degenerative disk disease.The sclerotic lesion of T11 is the most puzzling of the lesions. The bone scan indicated that it was in an area of active bone turnover. Nothing in the findings indicates the presence of metastatic tumor. The radiologic findings are most consistent with a reaction to degenerative disk disease. The MRI scan provides the most evidence for this interpretation. Bone marrow changes adjacent to degenerative disk disease have been demonstrated by MRI scanning[2](#core-r002) and have been classified.[3](#core-r003) A complete MRI evaluation of this patient is lacking because there were no T2-weighted images. In degenerative disk disease Type I changes are noted as a decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and an increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. This type of change is seen in 4 percent of patients who undergo MRI scanning for disk disease and is associated with end-plate disruption and fissuring with ingrowth of vascularized fibrous tissue. Type II changes, which are characterized by increased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and an isointense or slightly increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, are found in 16 percent of the patients. These changes are associated with fatty marrow replacement in the vertebral body. Type III changes are characterized by decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images,[4](#core-r004) which is correlated with bony sclerosis on plain radiographs. With Types I and II changes, sclerosis is not demonstrable on radiographs. In Type III changes, sclerosis is caused by the presence of woven bone. Type I changes have been observed to convert to Type II changes during a three-year follow-up period, whereas Type II changes have been stable over a similar period of follow-up study.[3](#core-r003) Types I and II changes have no known relation to symptoms. The changes observed in this patient are consistent with Type III disk degeneration. The end-plate defect raises the possibility of a Schmorl's nodule, an intravertebral disk herniation that can be associated with sclerosis within the vertebral body adjacent to the intravertebral herniated disk.Disk degeneration can be confused with vertebral osteomyelitis on plain radiographs and bone scans. MRI scans can be useful in distinguishing these diseases.[5](#core-r005) The MRI criteria for the diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis include a confluent decrease in signal intensity on T1-weighted images from the vertebral bodies and disks without a discernible margin, an increased signal intensity in the vertebral body on T2-weighted images, and an increased signal intensity from the disk with an abnormal configuration, in which the nuclear cleft of the disk is absent. Metastatic tumor is distinguished from osteomyelitis by absence of involvement of the disk space, although early osteomyelitis before the disk is involved can result in an image indistinguishable from that of metastatic tumor. The MRI criteria for osteomyelitis are not fulfilled in this case, although a complete MRI evaluation was not done.The third lesion demonstrated by the studies is the area of very high signal intensity seen on the T1-weighted MRI scan, which may have been caused by a hemangioma. Hemangiomas are usually located in the lower thoracic spine and are found in 11 percent of spines examined post mortem.[6](#core-r006) They are generally asymptomatic; when symptoms do occur they are due to vertebral collapse or expansion of the tumor into the spinal canal.[7,8](#core-r007) The typical radiographic image of a hemangioma shows vertical striations, and the CT scan usually demonstrates the vertical trabeculae with intervening soft-tissue or fat attenuation. The MRI scan shows a markedly increased signal intensity on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. Hemorrhage and thrombosis can also cause an increase in signal intensity on T1-weighted images. Focal fat deposition related to age and spondylosis may mimic a hemangioma and is found equally often in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. Focal fat deposition is typically bright on T1-weighted images, rounded and well delineated, and 0.5 to 1.5 cm in diameter and is usually in the peripheral portion of the vertebral body or adjacent to the end plates or the posterior elements. Unlike a hemangioma, it is not associated with an increased signal on T2-weighted images and thus can be distinguished from a hemangioma.[9](#core-r009) The lesion in this case does not appear to have been an intraosseous lipoma, which is rare and generally solitary, predominates in the extremities, and has sclerotic margins and frequently a central nidus of calcification.[10](#core-r010)A T2-weighted MRI scan could have helped in the differential diagnosis of the lesion observed on the T1-weighted imaging and would have been my first choice in the diagnostic testing. Further MRI evaluation could have been done with gadolinium enhancement, which would have demonstrated a hemangioma but not a fatty lesion, or by the use of a chemical-shift selective presaturation technique, which would have separated water-based and lipid-based images.[11](#core-r011) Further MRI evaluation would probably have shown that the lesion in T9 was the same as that in T11. However, I cannot explain the patient's symptoms on the basis of that lesion. It is more likely that her symptoms arose from the process causing the sclerotic lesion, where the imaging was consistent with disk degeneration. The clinical course was not typical of disk degeneration, and I shall not be surprised to learn that osteomyelitis, consistent with her progressive clinical course and severe pain, was found, although there is no evidence of advanced osteomyelitis in the imaging studies. The use of gallium scanning would have been of importance in supporting that diagnosis. Since diagnostic pathological information must be provided, my diagnostic test of choice would have been a needle biopsy of T11 in the area of sclerosis adjacent to the disk.In conclusion, my diagnoses are intervertebral disk disease, a hemangioma or focal fat deposition, and possibly osteomyelitis in T11.Dr. Robert E. Scully: May we have the medical students' diagnosis?Dr. Michael V. Seiden: The medical students considered many diagnoses, including infection, primary or metastatic tumor, and metabolic processes. They could find no specific information supporting the diagnosis of osteomyelitis or primary or metastatic bone tumor and concluded that the most likely diagnosis was calcification of the intervertebral disk secondary to pseudogout or some other metabolic process.Dr. Scully: Dr. Pitcher, will you tell us your preoperative impressions?Dr. J. David Pitcher, Jr.: Because of the progressive symptoms we were concerned about the possibility of metastatic tumor, myeloma, chondrosarcoma, or, least likely, indolent osteomyelitis. The unusual picture led us to conclude that a needle biopsy would be unlikely to provide a representative sample, and we chose to do an open biopsy through a costotransversectomy approach. Our leading diagnosis was metastatic tumor, although there was no evidence of a primary tumor or metastatic tumor elsewhere.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. John X. O'Connell: The diagnostic procedure was an open biopsy of the T11 vertebral body. The surgical specimen consisted of numerous fragments of cortical and trabecular bone and degenerated intervertebral-disk material. Microscopical examination revealed numerous irregularly shaped, purple-staining refractile crystals embedded within the degenerated intervertebral disk and within granulation tissue that had eroded into the bone. These crystals were not birefringent when examined with polarized light and were morphologically typical of calcium hydroxyapatite. A foreign-body giant-cell reaction and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate surrounded the crystals ([Fig. 4](#f004)), resulting in the lytic defect seen on the imaging studies. There was no evidence of osteomyelitis or a vascular or fatty neoplasm. The adjacent cortical and trabecular bone was necrotic and was rimmed by viable-appearing reactive woven bone, which produced the sclerotic rim seen on the radiologic studies. The diagnosis is hydroxyapatite-crystal deposition within a degenerated intervertebral disk, with erosion of the adjacent vertebral body.Calcium hydroxyapatite is a basic calcium phosphate.[12](#core-r012) Hydroxyapatite crystals range from 75 to 250 nm in their longest dimension and are characteristically nonbirefringent. Their specific identification requires x-ray diffraction studies or electron-microscopical examination. The crystals can be recognized in soft tissue when they become aggregated into clumps. They are characteristically stained blue-purple with hematoxylin and eosin staining before decalcification and are weakly eosinophilic after decalcification. In synovial fluid they form microspheroids of irregular size and shape.[13](#core-r013)Calcium hydroxyapatite can be deposited in periarticular soft tissues or within joints. In either event the disease may be monoarticular or polyarticular. Periarticular disease affects men and women with equal frequency and occurs most commonly during the fifth to eighth decades. Intraarticular disease also affects adults, women more commonly than men. Crystals can be deposited within the articular cartilage, the synovium, or the joint capsule. A common location of periarticular crystal deposition is within the tendons about the shoulder, and in this location the process is termed \"calcifying tendinitis.\" Spinal involvement is manifested by deposition within intervertebral disks and paravertebral ligaments. The intervertebral-disk deposition is characteristically in the nucleus pulposus and causes early-morning stiffness, diminished range of motion, or acute episodes of pain.The pathogenesis of hydroxyapatite-crystal-deposition disease is unclear, and many theories have been proposed. Uhthoff et al.[14](#core-r014) suggested that crystals are deposited in soft tissues that have undergone fibrocartilaginous metaplasia, but other investigators[15](#core-r015) have been unable to identify fibrocartilaginous tissue and have suggested that repeated episodes of trauma or local ischemia predispose the patient to crystal deposition. In their study of patients with polyarticular disease, Pinals and Short[16](#core-r016) suggested that a generalized connective-tissue abnormality may predispose the patient to multiple sites of involvement. In support of this theory other investigators[17](#core-r017) have found that patients with certain HLA subtypes have polyarticular involvement with increased frequency.Acute episodes of inflammation are precipitated when crystals are released from the synovium into the synovial fluid or from periarticular soft tissue into periarticular bursae.[13](#core-r013) Activated lymphocytes, histiocytes, and giant cells release a variety of proteases, including collagenase, lymphokines, and prostaglandins. These proteases, particularly collagenase, may be responsible for the severe destructive changes that can be present in patients with crystal deposition. During the acute symptomatic phase the crystals are actively resorbed by the inflammatory cells.[15](#core-r015) The resultant progressive reduction in the number of crystals can be identified radiologically as a reduction in soft-tissue calcification after resolution of the symptoms.[16](#core-r016) Patients in whom crystals are not resorbed completely are predisposed to recurrent episodes of pain.A very unusual aspect of this case and the reason for the open biopsy was the presence of the large lytic defect in the T11 vertebral body. Bone erosion in association with hydroxyapatite-crystal deposition is rare but has been described at tendinous insertion sites.[18](#core-r018) The mechanism whereby the crystals gained access to the bone is not clear in this case. The possibilities include an inflammatory episode occurring within the disk with erosion through the end plate into the vertebral body; however, we did not see any evidence of acute inflammation within the degenerative disk tissue that we received. An alternative explanation may be that the crystals within the disk space produced a mass effect and were extruded through the end plate into the vertebral body. In any case, the mechanism of bone resorption in inflammatory disease is well established and is due to the production of mediators that stimulate osteoclast activity.[19](#core-r019) Activated lymphocytes and macrophages produce prostaglandins and interleukin-1, both of which stimulate and recruit osteoclasts. The osteoclast stimulation results in bone resorption, which in this case produced the large lytic defect seen on the radiologic studies.In summary, the diagnosis is hydroxyapatite-crystal\u2014deposition disease involving a degenerated intervertebral disk, with erosion into the adjacent vertebral body.Dr. Scully: Dr. Pitcher, will you tell us how you are managing this patient's care?Dr. Pitcher: Because of the benign nature of the disease the patient is being treated symptomatically, and her condition is stable. She remains minimally symptomatic with diminished activity and treatment with aspirin.Dr. Lipson: Dr. Rosenthal, do you think that some of the techniques of magnetic resonance imaging might have elucidated the nature of the lesion and saved the patient from an open biopsy?Dr. Rosenthal: In my opinion there were too many atypical features of this case to have eliminated the necessity of a biopsy, regardless of the performance of additional studies. However, T2-weighted images, as you have pointed out, probably could have defined the nature of the lytic lesion to a greater extent.Dr. Heinrich O.E. Schmid: Dr. Lipson, if the imaging had provided the diagnosis, how would you have treated the patient?Dr. Lipson: First of all, with this T1-weighted bright-image lesion there was no reason not to do a T2-weighted MRI study. This case was approached from the point of view that a tumor was possible. If MRI technology had settled the issue and provided a diagnosis of a hemangioma or fat deposition, the presence of sclerosis might still have left a question of osteomyelitis unsettled. Nevertheless, an open operation could have been avoided. Management would have been symptomatic, with an orthotic, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication and supportive measures for pain.\n\nAddendum\n--------\n\nDr. Pitcher: The patient still has a small amount of discomfort at the biopsy site about two months after the operation. She can now stand and sit for three to four hours at a time. She is gradually increasing her tolerance of activities of daily living.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Patricia Musolino:\nA 49-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department of this hospital after the sudden onset of hemiplegia and aphasia during a transatlantic flight.\nThe patient had been well until approximately 2 hours before presentation, when severe weakness developed on the right side and she lost the ability to speak. The patient\u2019s husband alerted a flight attendant, and a passenger who was a physician informed the crew that they must transport her to a hospital within 3 hours to enable proper treatment. The pilot accelerated the aircraft to arrive in Boston within 2 hours after symptom onset. The patient was evaluated by emergency medical technicians on her arrival at the airport. The blood pressure was 146/82 mm Hg, and the pulse 100 beats per minute and regular. She had a right facial droop and was unable to lift her right arm. The capillary blood glucose level was 151 mg per deciliter (8.4 mmol per liter). Boston Emergency Medical Services (EMS) provided this hospital with prearrival notification, and the patient was brought by ambulance to the emergency department, where a multidisciplinary team had been assembled.\nThe patient had a history of migraine headaches, asthma, and recurrent intermittent swelling of her left thigh every few months since childhood, when she had undergone the surgical excision of a birthmark on the left inner thigh that had frequently bled. Medications were aspirin several days per week (for headaches) and asthma inhalers. She had no known allergies. She was traveling with her husband, who provided the history. She did not smoke cigarettes. There was no family history of hematologic disease or coagulation abnormalities.\nOn the initial examination, the patient was alert and followed simple commands but answered \u201cyup\u201d to all questions. The blood pressure was 146/77 mm Hg, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask at a rate of 4 liters per minute; the temperature was normal. The pupils were 3 mm and reactive to light. There was a left-gaze preference and a slight right facial droop. The right arm was flaccid (with a strength of 0 on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 indicating normal strength), and the right leg had minor weakness (with a strength of 5\u2212 out of 5). The strength on the left side and the remainder of the examination were normal.\nThe white-cell count was 11,900 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with 76.3% neutrophils. The troponin T level was 0.23 ng per milliliter (reference value, <0.03), the carbon dioxide level was 21.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 23.0 to 31.9), and the phosphorus level was 2.1 mg per deciliter (0.68 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.84 to 1.45 mmol per liter]). The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, prothrombin time, and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio were normal, as were blood levels of other electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, and lipase and results of renal-function tests, a toxicology screening, and electrocardiography.\nA diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery was made. The initial score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 14 (on a scale of 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe deficit).\nDr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez:\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild loss of gray\u2013white differentiation in the left insula that was thought to be related to acute infarction, hyperdensity of the proximal left middle cerebral artery and the terminus of the left internal carotid artery, a small hypodensity in the left thalamus, and no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage or mass lesion. A bolus of 5.4 mg of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was administered intravenously 13 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival, and then an infusion of 52.2 mg of t-PA was administered over a 1-hour period, for a total of 0.9 mg of t-PA per kilogram of body weight.\nCT angiography of the head and neck, performed immediately after the bolus of t-PA was administered, revealed a diminutive proximal left internal carotid artery and no enhancement of the left internal carotid artery as it entered the base of the skull, as well as thrombus in the left paraclinoid and supraclinoid internal carotid artery that extended into the left middle cerebral artery (M1 and proximal M2 segments), with reconstitution of the sylvian branches and prominent collateral vessels (\nFigure 1A\n). On delayed images, slow flow was seen in the distal left cervical internal carotid artery and the petrous and cavernous segments of the left internal carotid artery, and a tiny focus of hypoenhancement was seen in the distal aspect of the petrous segment of the right internal carotid artery, a finding that possibly represented a small thrombus. Fifty-one minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed restricted diffusion involving the left insula (\nFigure 1B\n), posterior limb of the left internal capsule, and left medial temporal lobe, as well as punctate foci of restricted diffusion in the left frontal and parietal lobes and the right frontal lobe near the vertex; these findings are consistent with infarction involving the territory of the left middle cerebral artery. The volume of the diffusion abnormality was less than 25 ml, and therefore the patient was likely to benefit from endovascular thrombectomy.\n1\nOn fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, there was hyperintensity in the branches of the left middle cerebral artery and in the petrous and cavernous segments of the left internal carotid artery; these findings are consistent with slow flow, which was seen on the earlier CT angiography. The presence of a focal area of susceptibility effect in the proximal left middle cerebral artery was consistent with the occlusive thrombus in the middle cerebral artery.\nThe NIHSS score was unchanged despite the administration of t-PA. One hour after the patient\u2019s arrival, she was transported to an angiography-equipped operating room for endovascular thrombectomy. The left internal carotid artery, anterior cerebral artery, and middle cerebral artery were successfully recanalized. On examination at the end of the procedure, the patient had mild difficulty with simple arithmetic but no other neurologic deficits; the NIHSS score was 0.\nDr. Musolino:\nThe patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit. Additional diagnostic studies were performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",

Schwamm:* This patient with acute stroke benefited from an integrated system of care,[2](#core-r002) which was implemented at a state-certified stroke center[3](#core-r003) and followed stroke-specific dispatch protocols and point-of-entry criteria[4](#core-r004) that have been used in Massachusetts since 2005.[5](#core-r005) The patient\u2019s husband immediately recognized the patient\u2019s stroke because he had seen a public service announcement[6](#core-r006) in the airport in Scotland and thus knew the warning signs of stroke. The possible diagnosis of stroke led the pilot to request medical assistance from Boston Logan International Airport, which triggered a cascade of events that resulted in rapid delivery of the patient to this hospital.\n### Prehospital Management\n\n*Dr. K. Sophia Dyer:* In this case, multiple components of the prehospital system were engaged. The pilot notified Massport Logan Fire Rescue Communications, who then notified Boston EMS Dispatch Operations. The Boston EMS providers who responded to the call had received stroke training and used the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale,[7](#core-r007) a stroke screening for three symptoms (facial droop, arm drift, and speech disturbance) that is based on the larger NIHSS. One point is designated for each abnormal finding, and a score higher than 0 indicates that a stroke-alert policy should be implemented and the EMS should provide the hospital staff with prearrival notification of a patient with a suspected stroke. The Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale has shown excellent correlation between prehospital providers\u2019 suspicion of stroke and physicians\u2019 confirmation of stroke.[7](#core-r007) This patient\u2019s score was 3 out of 3; she had facial droop, arm weakness, and limited speech.The hospital received prearrival notification through a radio call from the Boston EMS, who reported the patient\u2019s age and sex, symptoms related to the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale, vital signs, and time of symptom onset. (The radio call is provided in [Audio 1](#ca01), available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.) This patient\u2019s stroke symptoms started 2 hours before her arrival at the Boston airport. In one study, eligible patients who arrived at the hospital after prearrival notification and within 2 hours after symptom onset were more likely (than patients who arrived after no prearrival notification and within 2 hours after symptom onset) to receive t-PA within 3 hours after symptom onset; such patients also had a shorter time between arrival at the hospital and t-PA administration, between symptom onset and t-PA administration, and between arrival at the hospital and the performance of imaging studies.[8](#core-r008)\n### Initial Hospital Management\n\n*Dr. Schwamm:* The hospital-based response to acute stroke in this case began with the administration of intravenous t-PA, which according to established guidelines,[9](#core-r009) is a class 1, level of evidence A treatment recommendation for eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke who can be treated within 3 hours after stroke onset (defined as the time that the patient had last been well). Since the effect of t-PA treatment is highly time-dependent,[10](#core-r010) guidelines recommend treatment within 60 minutes after arrival at the hospital.[11,12](#core-r011) This patient received t-PA within 13 minutes after arrival, which substantially improved her chances of a successful outcome.However, intravenous t-PA is ineffective in most patients with proximal-artery occlusions,[13](#core-r013) including this patient. In such patients, additional treatment with Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved mechanical thrombectomy devices has been shown to be beneficial in several large, randomized trials[14\u201316](#core-r014) in which patients were first treated with intravenous t-PA (if eligible) and then randomly assigned to either undergo thrombectomy or receive no further intervention, if additional imaging studies confirmed the presence of a proximal occlusion and did not show evidence of a large infarct. This patient met the criteria for thrombectomy that are used at this hospital, and she was transported to the endovascular suite; groin puncture occurred 43 minutes after the first imaging study of the head had been obtained, and successful recanalization was achieved 45 minutes later. Recanalization was completed well before the recommended target of 2 hours after arrival at the emergency department[17](#core-r017) and just under 4 hours after symptom onset. This procedure resulted in a remarkable recovery to an NIHSS score of 0.\n### Evaluation for the Cause of Stroke\n\nOn the second hospital day, when the patient was able to speak, careful questioning revealed that she had had chest discomfort and severe shortness of breath just before the onset of weakness, and this had prompted the flight attendant to instruct her to breathe into a paper bag to relieve what the crew believed to be a panic attack. She also reported having had a severe reaction to contrast material during childhood.Laboratory evaluation for the cause of stroke was performed. Results of routine laboratory testing were unremarkable, as were lipid levels, including a total cholesterol level of 145 mg per deciliter (3.75 mmol per liter), a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 83 mg per deciliter (2.15 mmol per liter), and a Lp(a) lipoprotein level of 4 mg per deciliter (reference value, <3). Levels of fibrinogen, total homocysteine, thyrotropin, and \u03b22-glycoproteins were normal. Repeat CT of the head, performed 24 hours after the administration of t-PA, revealed no evidence of hemorrhage, and prophylactic enoxaparin therapy for deep venous thrombosis was begun.In more than 60% of patients with ischemic stroke, the cause is readily established and is most often atherosclerosis or heart disease. In such patients, a simple evaluation with unenhanced CT of the head, basic laboratory testing, and ultrasonography of the carotid arteries and heart is sufficient to determine the cause and treatment. However, in a young patient (<50 years of age) such as this one, with no traditional vascular risk factors and a large clot burden, we would broaden the search to include, at minimum, thrombophilia, arterial dissection, paradoxical embolism, and unusual arteriopathies ([Table 1](#t01)).[18\u201320](#core-r018) Cases of stroke with these causes are uncommon and may initially appear to be uncomplicated, but in a clinical setting in which efforts are taken to increase value in health care[21](#core-r021) by eliminating unnecessary testing, it is easy to become less vigilant and fail to unearth unusual causes of stroke in young persons.Hints to the cause of this patient\u2019s stroke became available by the second hospital day, when the patient could speak; these hints included the presence of chest pain, dyspnea, and tachypnea at rest before the onset of stroke, the occurrence of the stroke during airplane travel, the unexplained elevated troponin level along with normal results on echocardiography, and the childhood history of a vascular abnormality in the left thigh. These clues prompted further investigation for venous thromboembolism as a source of paradoxical embolism. Because the patient reported a possible allergy to contrast material (although she had had no reaction to the injection of contrast material on the previous day) and because there was also concern that CT angiography of the chest might not detect small, distal emboli, a ventilation\u2013perfusion scan was performed to identify evidence of pulmonary embolism. This evaluation is critical, since detection of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in a patient with cryptogenic stroke mandates a minimum of 3 months of anticoagulation therapy, rather than the recommended antiplatelet therapy, to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism.On the fourth day, transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal size and function of both ventricles, an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 27 mm Hg, and trace insufficiency of the aortic, mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonary valves. Color Doppler echocardiography with the injection of an agitated-saline contrast agent revealed evidence of a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting. The d-dimer level was 5139 ng per milliliter (normal value, <500). Ultrasonography of the legs showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.*Dr. Gonzalez:* On the fifth day, ventilation\u2013perfusion scanning of the lungs revealed perfusion defects in the right upper lobe and bilateral lower lobes, as well as normal pulmonary distribution of the tracer on ventilation imaging. CT angiography of the chest revealed filling defects in multiple branches of the pulmonary artery ([Figure 2A](#f02)), a finding that confirms the presence of pulmonary embolism. Pelvic magnetic resonance angiography revealed the anatomical features indicative of the May\u2013Thurner syndrome: severe stenosis (>50%) of the left common iliac vein caused by an overlying right common iliac artery ([Figure 2B](#f02)), as well as collateral venous drainage that suggests that the stenosis is hemodynamically significant. No thrombus was identified. The study also revealed a mass in the right kidney. Abdominal CT confirmed the presence of an enhancing, partially necrotic mass (measuring 7.5 cm in greatest dimension), a finding consistent with a renal-cell carcinoma involving the right kidney ([Figure 2C](#f02)).\n### Vascular Studies in Acute Stroke\n\n*Dr. Michael R. Jaff:* Venous thromboembolic disease, specifically deep venous thrombosis of the leg, remains an important component of the differential diagnosis of ischemic stroke in young patients. In this case, venous duplex ultrasonography was negative for deep venous thrombosis. The sensitivity of venous duplex ultrasonography is 94% and the specificity is 98% when patients have symptoms and signs of deep venous thrombosis.[22](#core-r022) However, the use of venous duplex ultrasonography as a screening test in asymptomatic patients who are at risk for deep venous thrombosis has only 60% sensitivity[23](#core-r023); reasons for the low sensitivity include the difficulty in identifying isolated calf-vein thrombus and isolated iliac-vein thrombus, inexperience of the technician, and complete embolization of the deep venous thrombosis.The frequency of deep venous thrombosis among patients with ischemic stroke ranges from 7.6%[24](#core-r024) to 11.6%.[25](#core-r025) Therefore, searching for pelvic deep venous thrombosis in this patient was certainly important. There are two major reasons that this patient would have had deep venous thrombosis and stroke: prolonged air travel and possible patent foramen ovale with paradoxical embolism. It is generally believed that deep venous thrombosis associated with prolonged air travel is rare; one analysis identifies a risk of 27 cases of pulmonary embolism per 1 million flights and a 0.05% prevalence of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis during flights.[26](#core-r026) The highest prevalence appears to be among those who travel on flights with a duration of 12 to 18 hours; in this subset of patients, the risk of venous thromboembolism is 2.6 cases per 1 million travelers.[26](#core-r026) Since this patient was traveling only from the United Kingdom to the northeastern United States, it seems unlikely that air travel was a major risk factor.The more likely contributor to the increased risk of deep venous thrombosis in this patient is the presence of the May\u2013Thurner syndrome, a common anatomical anomaly in which the right common iliac artery, a muscular structure, extrinsically compresses the thin-walled left common iliac vein. This anatomical feature of the May\u2013Thurner syndrome was identified in up to 25% of an asymptomatic population[27](#core-r027); none of these patients had unilateral edema or a history of deep venous thrombosis of the legs.[28,29](#core-r028) Among patients (such as this one) with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale, the prevalence of the May\u2013Thurner syndrome is 6.3%.[30](#core-r030) The fact that no thrombus was identified at the time that magnetic resonance angiography was performed suggests that complete embolization of the thrombus had caused the stroke.\n### Prevention of Recurrent Stroke\n\n*Dr. Schwamm:* For patients with ischemic stroke and patent foramen ovale and without definitive evidence of deep venous thrombosis, guidelines[31](#core-r031) indicate that the current data are insufficient to establish whether anticoagulation is equivalent or superior to aspirin for the prevention of recurrent stroke, and available data do not support a benefit of patent foramen ovale closure. In a recent meta-analysis[32](#core-r032) including a total of 4251 patients, those who had stroke with patent foramen ovale did not have a higher risk of either recurrent stroke or the combination of stroke and transient ischemic attack than did those who had stroke without patent foramen ovale. However, for patients such as this one, who have both a patent foramen ovale and a presumed venous source of embolism, anticoagulation is generally indicated. When anticoagulation is contraindicated, because of an increased risk of intracranial or systemic hemorrhage, then placement of an inferior vena cava filter is a reasonable option. In addition, patent foramen ovale closure by means of a transcatheter device might be considered, depending on the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis.For all immobilized patients with ischemic stroke, the subcutaneous administration of anticoagulants is recommended to prevent deep venous thrombosis; this treatment was begun in this patient after CT of the head revealed no intracerebral hemorrhage 24 hours after the administration of intravenous t-PA. Once the pulmonary embolism was identified, therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with enoxaparin was begun; a 3-month course was planned after discussion with the patient and her husband of the risks and benefits of anticoagulation in a patient with a recent cerebral infarction. Our concern about this patient was heightened by the evidence of pulmonary embolism on imaging studies and by the elevated troponin level that had been revealed on her arrival to this hospital. Among patients with pulmonary embolism, an elevated troponin level has been associated with an increased mortality rate; the level is not commonly elevated after stroke in patients who do not have coronary heart disease.[33](#core-r033) In several small studies, the risk of stroke was up to 17% higher[34](#core-r034) among patients who presented with symptomatic pulmonary embolism than among those who did not, and the risk was particularly increased among patients with right ventricular dysfunction.On the sixth hospital day, only 2 days after anticoagulation was begun, the patient\u2019s condition suddenly worsened. Aphasia recurred, and MRI revealed hemorrhagic transformation in the left temporal lobe. Anticoagulation was immediately stopped, but the patient had a substantially increased risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism because of the presence of an anatomical nidus (the May\u2013Thurner syndrome) and a prothrombotic stimulus (suspected carcinoma). The decision was made to place a removable inferior vena cava filter, but there was concern that emboli small enough to pass through the filter could still cause occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, which ranges from 3 to 5 mm in cross-sectional diameter in most adults. Inferior vena cava filters must be porous enough to allow adequate flow to prevent thrombosis of the inferior vena cava, and in vitro studies[35](#core-r035) of available filters suggest that the average rate of capturing a clot measuring 3 mm by 5 mm is 15 to 70%. For this reason, cardiac catheterization with patent foramen ovale closure and placement of an inferior vena cava filter was performed on the evening of the sixth hospital day. Six days later, right nephrectomy was performed.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Amelia E. Huck:* The kidney specimen contained a well-circumscribed, yellow\u2013orange mass (7.0 cm in greatest dimension) in the inferior pole, without gross renal-vein invasion ([Figure 3A](#f03)). The tumor was composed of nests of cells with round nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and clear cytoplasm ([Figure 3B and 3C](#f03)), and it extended into a muscle-containing, segmental branch of the renal vein ([Figure 3D, 3E, and 3F](#f03)). A diagnosis of clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma \u2014 Fuhrman grade 2 (on a scale of 1 to 4, with grade 2 indicating the presence of 15-\u03bcm round nuclei with open chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli) and stage pT3a (according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system) \u2014 was made.The rate of venous thromboembolism among patients with cancer varies according to tumor factors (including tumor type, the presence or absence of metastasis, and the anatomical features of the tumor) and the patients\u2019 baseline risk factors and previous and current therapies. Approximately 20% of first venous thromboembolic events occur in patients with cancer; the risk of venous thromboembolism among patients with cancer is 4 to 7 times as high as the risk among those without cancer. In one study, venous thromboembolism developed in only 1.3% of patients during the first 2 years after the patients received a diagnosis of localized renal-cell carcinoma; 0.4% received a concurrent diagnosis of venous thromboembolism and localized renal-cell carcinoma.[36](#core-r036) Patients with renal-cell carcinoma, particularly those with metastases, often present with elevated levels of fibrinogen, d-dimer, and fibrin monomers.[37](#core-r037) Immunofluorescence staining with the use of antibodies specific for fibrin and factors VII and X has shown positivity around intravascular and extravascular nodules of renal-cell carcinoma tumor cells, thus raising the possibility that tumor cells activate coagulation locally.[38](#core-r038) Another risk factor for venous thromboembolism is tumor invasion into large veins. Although this finding was not present in this patient, invasion of the renal vein or inferior vena cava occurs in 4 to 10% of cases of renal-cell carcinoma.Patient factors, such as older age, obesity, prior venous thromboembolism, and inherited hypercoagulability, also contribute to the risk of venous thromboembolism among patients with cancer. A panel designed to evaluate for hereditary causes of hypercoagulability was performed in this case. The panel revealed a slightly low level of antithrombin (75%; normal value, >80), which was possibly attributable to heparin use, as well as low levels of functional protein S (47%; normal value, >70) and free protein S (56%; normal value, >70). The low protein S levels could represent a hereditary hypercoagulable state; however, they may have been due to recent consumption of protein S or due to an acute-phase reaction, since protein S is usually bound to the C4b binding protein, an acute-phase reactant. Repeat testing was recommended. Results of assays for prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, lupus anticoagulant, activated protein C resistance, protein C, and prothrombin gene mutation were normal.\n\nFollow-up\n---------\n\n*Dr. Schwamm:* The patient\u2019s subsequent hospital course was complicated by deep venous thrombosis with occlusion of the left common iliac vein, which required two thrombectomies and ultimately stenting to maintain venous patency of the left leg. The patient nonetheless had a major neurologic recovery and was discharged from the hospital 1 month after her admission. She returned to Scotland on a commercial airline flight.The patient has done well under the care of a neurologist and hematologist in Scotland and has had no recurrent thrombotic events. Through the use of telehealth technology and the Massachusetts General Hospital TeleHealth program, follow-up visits have been performed to allow her physicians at this hospital to continue to participate in her care and decisions regarding the duration of anticoagulation.The patient has returned to work full-time and has resumed almost all her previous activities, although she has some difficulty with arithmetic and executive functions. She has described this illness as a \u201cstroke of luck,\u201d since it enabled early detection and resection of an occult renal-cell carcinoma. She described the care she received as compassionate, thorough, and high-quality and appreciated the patient-centered approach, which allowed her voice to be considered in the difficult management decisions for which there was no clear evidence-based guidance.In summary, in the management of acute ischemic stroke, rapid initiation of intravenous t-PA in eligible patients is critical, and rapid thrombectomy for recanalization in patients with proximal-artery occlusion is of proven efficacy. During the evaluation for the cause of stroke and before the initiation of prevention for recurrent stroke, it is important to remember the following advice: If you hear hoof beats, think horses. But if the pattern of hoof prints appears suspicious, be on the lookout for a zebra.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Emily Senecal\n(Emergency Medicine): A 72-year-old left-handed woman was transported by helicopter from her home to the emergency department of this hospital because of a sudden change in mental status and left hemiparesis.\nOn the day of admission, she was well when last seen by her husband at 11:30 a.m. At 12:15 p.m., her son called her at home, and she produced only slurred and unintelligible speech. He called his sister, who notified emergency medical services (EMS). At 12:45 p.m., the daughter arrived at the patient's home, followed shortly by EMS, and they found the patient lying on the floor. She was awake but not moving her left side, and her gaze was deviated to the right. The pupils were round; the right was 5 mm in diameter and reactive to light (constricting to 4 mm), and the left was 3 mm in diameter and reactive to light (constricting to 2 mm). Her speech was slurred, but she provided appropriate \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d oral responses. The glucose level on a finger-stick capillary sample was normal. A cervical collar was applied, since the patient had fallen, and two peripheral intravenous lines were placed.\nAt 12:56 p.m., the EMS providers radioed for air medical response to transfer the patient from her home to this hospital. A helicopter was dispatched at 12:57 p.m.; the air medical operations center simultaneously notified the emergency department of the impending arrival of a patient with presumed stroke. While awaiting arrival of the air medical crew, the EMS providers noticed that the patient's speech and weakness had worsened; because of concern about her ability to protect her airway, they attempted nasotracheal intubation, using as premedication 75 mg of intravenous lidocaine, 2 mg of intravenous midazolam, and 5 mg of intravenous diazepam. This was unsuccessful, and the patient was given oxygen through a nonrebreathing mask.\nThe air medical crew (a nurse and a paramedic) arrived at 1:20 p.m. They found that the patient's left arm and leg were paralyzed and her speech was slurred. She opened her eyes when trying to talk, made incomprehensible sounds, and followed commands regarding her right arm and leg; the score on the Glasgow coma scale was 11 (a score of 3 indicates a deep coma, and 15 that a patient is fully alert and following motor commands), and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) was estimated to be 30 (a score of 0 indicates normal function, 20 a major stroke syndrome, and 42 deep coma). The blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg, the pulse 92 beats per minute, the respirations 14 per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 percent while the patient was wearing a nonrebreathing mask.\nOrotracheal intubation was performed at 1:31 p.m. with the use of topical anesthesia containing 14 percent benzocaine, 2 percent butamben, 2 percent tetracaine hydrochloride, and 0.5 percent benzalkonium chloride (Cetacaine, Cetylite) and supplemented with 50 \u03bcg of fentanyl (just under 1 \u03bcg per kilogram of estimated weight) intravenously. Despite a repeated dose of 50 \u03bcg of fentanyl, the patient reached for the endotracheal tube with her right arm. To prevent extubation during transport, she was given 5 mg of pancuronium (just under 0.1 mg per kilogram of estimated weight) intravenously. The remainder of the transport was without incident. The air medical crew radioed the emergency department with the patient's information and estimated time of arrival.\nAt 1:45 p.m., the patient arrived in the emergency department and was met by a team of emergency physicians and stroke neurologists. She remained intubated and pharmacologically paralyzed. The blood pressure was 164/76 mm Hg, the temperature 36.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 100 percent while she was receiving assisted ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0. Physical examination revealed no evidence of trauma. The pupils were 2 mm in diameter, round, and reacted to light with constriction to 1.8 mm. The change in pupillary reactivity was attributed to the recently administered paralytic agents. A cervical collar was in place. The general physical examination was normal. Since the patient was pharmacologically paralyzed, neurologic examination was not informative.\nThe patient's family arrived at the emergency department soon after the patient and provided additional history. Two weeks before admission and again two days before admission, the patient had reported 30 minutes of numbness of the left lower portion of her face. The night before admission, she had had a syncopal episode in the bathroom and had fallen and hit her head; she was aware of the event and informed her husband of it the next morning. She had a history of hypercholesterolemia and seasonal allergies. Her only medication was loratadine, and she had no known drug allergies. She had stopped smoking 40 years earlier. Her aunt and a first cousin had had strokes.\nAn electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm. A radiograph of the chest revealed that the endotracheal tube was well placed and the lungs were normal. The results of laboratory tests are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nAt 2:51 p.m., computed tomography (CT) of the head without intravenous contrast medium and CT angiography were performed. The images without contrast medium showed a hyperdense linear focus in the distribution of the main trunk (M1) of the right middle cerebral artery, which corresponded to a focal filling defect on the angiographic images. The findings were consistent with the presence of a clot in the main trunk of the right middle cerebral artery, extending into the first segments (M2 branches).\nA management decision was made.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nManagement\n----------\n\n*Dr. Stephen H. Thomas:* The key features of this case \u2014 focal neurologic deficits in the absence of apparent trauma \u2014 suggested an acute stroke. Just as time is crucial in cases of injury or myocardial infarction, expedited transport is vital to the optimization of outcomes among patients with stroke. Accordingly, EMS systems have worked to streamline both primary (from the scene) and secondary (from referring to receiving hospitals) transports of patients with stroke.\n### Primary Transport of Patients with Acute Stroke\n\nPrimary transport has been accelerated by emphasizing the urgency of dispatch for patients with suspected stroke.[1](#core-r001) EMS dispatchers are being trained to use stroke-assessment tools validated in the EMS and emergency department settings (e.g., the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale).[2,3](#core-r002) Secondary transport is becoming more efficient; the air medical service providing transport in this case has reported substantial improvements in the urgency with which referring hospitals arrange interfacility transfer of patients with stroke.[4](#core-r004)Does the goal of expedited transport to a stroke center justify bypassing closer hospitals? The patient's home, 15 miles from this hospital, was a 10-minute drive from a community hospital that lacked the capacity to perform rapid CT of the head. In the majority of cases of suspected stroke, the primary transport should be on the ground. However, for any time-critical diagnosis, situational logistics (e.g., traffic and the distance to a hospital) may occasionally dictate the need for air transport, and the use of helicopters by EMS has been an important means for extending the reach of stroke care centers.[4\u20138](#core-r004) In this case, the responding ground EMS personnel had received stroke training, including stroke diagnosis and field triage, from the department of neurology at this hospital and from Boston MedFlight (BMF). Considering the likelihood of the need for tertiary care and since the patient's condition was stable, the paramedics' decision in favor of direct transport to this hospital was wise, since an intermediate stop at the local facility would have added at least a half hour to the interval before arrival at a stroke center.[4](#core-r004)While BMF was en route to the scene, the deterioration in the patient's condition prompted ground EMS personnel to attempt endotracheal intubation using benzodiazepine sedation. The role of prehospital endotracheal intubation, in general and in this case, is debatable. According to one objective measure, the Glasgow Coma Score of 11, her condition had not deteriorated to the level (indicated by a score of 9 or less) that required endotracheal intubation.[9](#core-r009) However, other findings (e.g., evidence of deteriorating neurologic status) can suggest impending airway impairment and thus dictate the need for intubation. If intubation is likely to be needed, should it be done on the ground or in flight? Successful in-flight airway management was reported in 96 percent of the cases in one study,[9](#core-r009) suggesting that intubation can safely be deferred. In this case, we do not have enough information to determine whether the decision in favor of preflight endotracheal intubation was justified. Two benzodiazepines were administered; lidocaine was also given, presumably because of its neuroprotective effect, though this practice remains controversial.[10](#core-r010) Since the reported success rates of endotracheal intubation by ground EMS personnel using just benzodiazepine sedation is only 63 percent, the failure of the initial attempt is not unexpected.[11](#core-r011)The use of neuromuscular blockade to facilitate intubation in the field is perhaps the most controversial subject in prehospital medicine. A controlled clinical trial demonstrated that the use of paralytic agents by EMS teams with limited training yielded successful intubation in only 41 percent of patients.[12](#core-r012) The air medical crew in this case had had extensive airway-management training that supplements traditional lectures and mannequin sessions with experience with both animals and humans (operating room).[13](#core-r013) Implementation of such training is not easy, but programs that include such efforts have reported rates of successful intubation of 97 percent.[9,14](#core-r009) The air medical crew was able to intubate the patient without paralytic agents, underscoring the fact that successful prehospital airway management depends as much on education and experience as it does on access to any particular class of medication. Notably, current and preferred practice both in the emergency department and during air transport would be to perform an intubation facilitated by the use of neuromuscular blockade, with more adjunctive sedation than was used in this case.\n### Use of Neuromuscular Blockade\n\nA paralytic agent was used in flight in this case because of concern that the patient was moving uncontrollably, as evidenced by an attempt at self-extubation. The patient had received two doses each of two sedatives, fentanyl and benzodiazepines, and her vital signs remained stable. Did she require chemical paralysis or simply more sedation? Additional sedation might have obviated the need for long-acting paralytic agents, but sedation takes time, and the risks of inadvertent extubation and other uncontrolled movements by a patient are not to be taken lightly in a helicopter. Nonetheless, the variables for prehospital decision making regarding the need for sedation in paralyzed patients parallel those used in the hospital environment, and prehospital providers must observe the clinical imperative to sedate paralyzed patients adequately. When there is doubt about the adequacy of sedation in a paralyzed patient, additional sedatives should be provided. There is insufficient information in this case to adjudicate with certainty the appropriateness of the use of paralytic agents as mentioned in the case record, but it is a cause for reflection and, potentially, concern.*Dr. Michael H. Lev:* A CT of the head performed without the use of contrast medium after the patient's arrival in the emergency department ([Figure 1A](#f01)) revealed a hyperdense right middle cerebral artery, a highly specific (>90 percent) indicator of acute vascular thrombosis.[15](#core-r015) The dense vessel typically contains a \u201cred\u201d thrombus, a loose network of predominantly red cells with some fibrin, rather than a \u201cwhite\u201d thrombus, which consists of cellular debris, fibrin, and platelets, but only a few red cells.[16](#core-r016) The presence of a radiologically dense thrombus may help to predict the likelihood of recanalization, since the loosely organized red clot permits better penetration of thrombolytic agents, whereas the more compact, fibrin-rich white clot may hinder thrombolysis because it is less permeable.[16](#core-r016)The presence of a thrombus in the proximal right middle cerebral artery was confirmed by CT angiography, a routine test at this hospital for all patients with acute stroke ([Figure 1B](#f01)). The accuracy of CT angiography of the circle of Willis for detecting and delineating proximal intravascular thrombus approaches that of conventional catheter arteriography.[17](#core-r017) Our acute-stroke protocol calls for CT of the head without the use of contrast medium to rule out hemorrhage and identify parenchymal hypodensity, followed by complete neurovascular CT angiography, which includes screening evaluation from the great-vessel origins at the aortic arch through the neck, skull base, and circle of Willis, to the cranial vertex.Because the images acquired during CT angiography are weighted according to the cerebral blood volume,[18](#core-r018) they can make the subtle, early ischemic lenticular hypodensities present on the unenhanced scan more conspicuous ([Figure 1C](#f01), arrows, and [Figure 1D](#f01)), and like magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging, may identify hypoperfused ischemic brain parenchyma likely to be irreversibly infarcted despite the use of vascular recanalization (\u201cinfarct core\u201d).[19\u201322](#core-r019) The sensitivity of CT angiography source images for the detection of large infarct cores approaches that of diffusion-weighted imaging.[19](#core-r019) The sensitivity for the detection of an infarct core on unenhanced CT can be improved by reviewing images with the use of optimized image-display settings.[23](#core-r023)*Dr. Lee H. Schwamm:* This 72-year-old left-handed woman had occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, accompanied by complete dysfunction of the right hemisphere with a gaze preference, left-sided weakness, anosagnosia (lack of awareness of her deficits), and speech that was slurred and at times incomprehensible. She had evidence of a clinical penumbra: a mismatch between the brain at risk (the large amount of electrically dysfunctional but still potentially salvageable brain tissue responsible for her deficits) and the brain destined to die (the small core of brain tissue shown to be irreversibly damaged on CT). She also had evidence of an imaging penumbra: a mismatch between brain regions with perturbed blood flow (delayed or reduced flow) and brain destined to die ([Figure 2](#f02)). Recent clinical trials have suggested that patients with this type of imaging penumbra may have longer therapeutic windows for intravenous thrombolysis than the three-hour limit used for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA).[24](#core-r024)\n### Reasons to Consider Thrombolysis in Acute Ischemic Stroke\n\nA randomized clinical trial in the 1990s[25](#core-r025) demonstrated that as compared with patients given placebo, patients treated with intravenous t-PA were at least 30 percent more likely to have minimal or no disability at one year.[26\u201328](#core-r026) Although intravenous t-PA is associated with an increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, the risk of death is not increased. A subsequent analysis confirmed the importance of treatment soon after the onset of stroke.[29](#core-r029) On the basis of these data, administration of intravenous t-PA is now recommended within 180 minutes after an acute ischemic stroke[30\u201332](#core-r030) and the Brain Attack Coalition defined a set of criteria for constituting a primary stroke center.[33](#core-r033) Subsequent registries have confirmed the safety of treatment with intravenous t-PA in the community.[31,34](#core-r031)When a patient such as this presents with symptoms of acute stroke, we must use all available information to determine whether there is still sufficient brain at risk to justify the hazards of thrombolytic treatment. Surrogates such as the time from the onset of symptoms and evidence of infarct progression on imaging help determine these risks. The Glasgow Coma Scale does not provide the information needed, since a patient with complete left hemiplegia, a left visual-field defect, and anosagnosia could still have a score of 15. The patient under discussion was not thought to be a favorable candidate for intravenous t-PA, since she had had symptoms in the preceding 24 hours, she had a high NIHSS at the scene, and the results of her neurologic assessment were pharmacologically obscured. It should be noted that any changes in pupil size or reactivity were not due to the use of neuromuscular blockade, since these agents do not alter the pupillary reflex.The benefit of catheter-based thrombolysis is less well studied than that of intravenous thrombolysis. A randomized trial comparing prourokinase combined with low-dose intravenous heparin to low-dose heparin alone in patients with persistent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery[35](#core-r035) found that patients treated with prourokinase were more likely to have recanalization and to be independent three months later. Despite an increase in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage within 24 hours, the mortality rate was similar. In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration approved a mechanical embolectomy device for removing thrombus in patients who are ineligible or have no response to treatment with intravenous t-PA[36](#core-r036); such an approach may offer some benefit in these patients.[37,38](#core-r037) The use of intraarterial fibrinolysis three to six hours after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery is considered a class II level B or C recommendation according to the American Heart Association[30,32](#core-r030) and should be done at an experienced stroke center with immediate access to cerebral angiography and interventional neuroradiology. The availability of intraarterial thrombolysis should not preclude the administration of intravenous t-PA in otherwise eligible patients.Because of the large territory of brain at risk, the patient under discussion was thought to be a candidate for reperfusion therapy. The risks and benefits of catheter-based thrombolysis were discussed with the family, and they elected to proceed. A propofol infusion was initiated, and the patient was taken directly from CT to the interventional neuroradiology suite. Angiography confirmed the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and showed that collateral blood flow through surface pial arteries from the anterior cerebral artery was helping to keep the cortex of the middle cerebral artery perfused. Intravenous eptifibatide was initiated (a bolus of 90 \u03bcg per kilogram was followed by an infusion of 0.5 \u03bcg per kilogram per minute) and was followed by intraarterial t-PA at 3:30 p.m. By 5:30 p.m., all vessels had been opened except for a distal branch of the middle cerebral artery supplying the frontal lobe. The patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit, and unenhanced CT of the head showed salvage of the entire cortical region at risk, with only deep gray-matter infarction.*Dr. Lev:* Complete recanalization of the middle cerebral artery was achieved with the use of intraarterial thrombolysis within six hours after the onset of stroke. Follow-up unenhanced CT three days later showed complete recanalization of the middle cerebral artery, except for a small distal, frontal embolus in the artery ([Figure 3A](#f03)). CT ([Figure 3B](#f03)), diffusion-weighted imaging ([Figure 3C](#f03)), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ([Figure 3D](#f03)) confirmed the presence of an infarct core at the right lenticular nucleus. A small distal right frontal cortical infarct was also apparent, attributable to the distal embolus in the middle cerebral artery.*Dr. Schwamm:* The patient had an excellent clinical outcome. No source of embolism was detected, and she was discharged on the seventh hospital day to inpatient acute care rehabilitation while receiving antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention. At the time of discharge, she was alert and fully oriented, with fluent speech but some difficulty with naming. She had a left-sided facial droop and a very mild weakness of the left leg but could walk independently. By three months after the stroke, she had had a truly remarkable recovery, with a normal neurologic examination except for trouble reading difficult material, such as newspapers and textbooks. Four years later she had no neurologic impairment.This case highlights the need for integrated, community-wide care for stroke.[39](#core-r039) In 2004, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) implemented a hospital-based acute-stroke licensure program to support rapid evaluation of patients for possible intravenous t-PA therapy.[40,41](#core-r040) The system directs patients who have had stroke symptoms for no longer than two hours to nearby DPH-approved primary stroke service hospitals, with the use of telemedicine-enabled acute-stroke consultation[42](#core-r042) as needed to provide access to bedside neurologic expertise (see the [video clip](#v01), available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org).*Dr. Leslie W. Milne* (Emergency Medicine): How do you decide between CT and MRI before you order intravenous t-PA or other therapy?*Dr. Schwamm:* The published data on efficacy are based on the unenhanced CT. Treatment should begin as soon as the results of the examination, history taking, laboratory analyses, and unenhanced CT confirm a patient's eligibility. For sites considering catheter-based intervention, CT angiography provides rapid neurovascular assessment, but it is not available at many centers. MRI with diffusion-weighted and perfusion imaging may be useful in patients with normal findings on unenhanced CT if it can be done within 25 minutes after a patient's arrival.*Dr. James Gordon* (Emergency Medicine): What is the current thinking about the use of thrombolysis for small-vessel as compared with large-vessel disease?*Dr. Schwamm:* The National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke study did not require patients to undergo vascular imaging before treatment, but there was no difference in effect between presumed small-vessel and large-vessel stroke.[43](#core-r043) Although many people have questioned the wisdom of using intravenous t-PA in small-vessel stroke because the outcome of natural recovery is presumed to be excellent, only 33 to 50 percent of the patients had this outcome at three months. In addition, many patients who did not receive intravenous t-PA because they were deemed to have mild or rapidly improving stroke are subsequently unable to be discharged home because they are not ambulatory.[43](#core-r043)*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): This patient lived in a suburb of Boston. Where did the helicopter land to pick her up?*Dr. Thomas:* We have plotted landing zones near just about any conceivable area (i.e., a school field, a parking lot, or in the street). Ground transport is used from the home to the landing area.*Dr. David F. Brown* (Emergency Medicine): Although this patient did very well, it took about an hour from the time the first EMS crew arrived to her arrival in our emergency department. The patient might have been transported by ground transportation to a local hospital with a stroke center much more rapidly and could have been treated with thrombolysis even more promptly than she was here. Do you envision that the numbers of stroke facilities will continue to grow throughout the state and throughout the country so that air transport will remain rare? Or are we heading toward a system of acute-stroke care that will be similar to that for patients with trauma, in which patients will be preferentially taken (by ground or by air) to a select group of large hospitals that will provide comprehensive stroke care?*Dr. Schwamm:* The two models you just proposed are playing out differently in different parts of the country. In Massachusetts, the decision was made to emphasize primary stroke centers, a relatively low-level facility designation that would be available within a short distance of every patient in the Commonwealth, and to strengthen the connections of such hospitals to more comprehensive centers. The plan recognizes that air transport might be appropriate when you cannot reach a nearby stroke center or the nearest center is not currently capable (e.g., the CT scanner is offline).\n",

      "question": "First admission.\nA twenty-nine-year-old married woman entered the hospital because of a nontender lump in her left breast.\nShe noticed this lump about six weeks before entry, and it apparently had not increased in size since then. There had not been any bleeding from the nipple or soreness under the arm. The patient was nine and a half months post partum, having delivered a normal girl, her first child. She did not nurse the child because she did not believe she was emotionally suited to nursing. There was no weight loss or anorexia.\nExcept for the local lesion in the left breast, physical examination was entirely negative. The left breast was filled with a firm, grape-like cluster of nodules, densest in the inner middle quadrant. It was nontender, not fixed to the skin or chest wall and did not produce blood at the nipple on pressure. There was a bean-sized nodule in the left axilla.\nA radial incision was made medial to the areola, and the involved area of breast tissue was excised. Immediate pathological examination showed no evidence of cancer, and the specimen received in the laboratory measured 5 by 4.2 cm. and was diagnosed as sclerosing adenosis and periductal mastitis.\nSecond admission\n(ten months later). Soon after operation a small swelling developed near the operative incision, but this was considered to be an operative sequela. The patient received several doses of testosterone and then stilbestrol, with some improvement. However, because of the persistence of the mass and her continued anxiety, an aspiration was performed with return of old blood clot. It was believed that the lesion was a hematoma, and she was therefore admitted to the hospital for evacuation of it.\nA circumareolar incision was made in the upper inner corner of the left breast. A considerable amount of blood clot was evacuated, together with a good deal of bright blood, and the incision was extended down along the line of the previous incision. The tissue was so necrotic and the bleeding so brisk that eventually a mastectomy was performed.\nThird admission\n(four months later). After discharge the patient felt well and gained 6 pounds. About eight weeks before admission, however, she began to feel a slight pain in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. She was examined by her physician seven weeks before entry, but no mass was palpable; however, the pain continued. One week before admission the patient was re-examined, and a mass was found in the right breast. She was therefore referred back to the hospital.\nPhysical examination showed an area of thickening, 2 by 3 cm., which was slightly firm, nontender and not well defined, in the upper, outer quadrant of the right breast. The scar of the left mastectomy was well healed.\nOn the second hospital day exploration of the right breast was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Grantley W. Taylor: This is to my knowledge the briefest physical examination of a patient that I have ever seen in a clinicopathological conference. So this case will simply form some sort of text on which we can hang a number of not too brilliant diagnoses.Here is a patient with something the matter with her breast, which was explored, who got into trouble postoperatively and in whom a mastectomy finally had to be done. I think that is deplorable. The findings on exploration \u2014 sclerosing adenosis and periductal mastitis \u2014 represent some of the disintegrated segments of the old category of chronic cystic mastitis. Foote and Stewart[1](#core-r001) subdivided that clinical group of diseases, and I noticed with a good deal of amusement that often one of the residents in pathology is apt to make seven or eight diagnoses in that category on a single patient. The problem of the relation of this disease to malignant neoplasm is one that is very poorly clarified. Dr. Shields Warren,[2](#core-r002) some years ago, undertook to find out what relation this general group of diseases called chronic cystic mastitis bears to the subsequent development of cancer. In reviewing patients who had had partial breast excisions or partial amputations that he had followed up he found that the incidence of cancer was definitely increased. The series was large enough to be statistically valid. Unfortunately, from my viewpoint, he did not subdivide the disease into the various subdivisions that Foote and Stewart recommend. Therefore, it is impossible to say which one of these various categories is the most likely to be associated with subsequent development of the malignant process. He did divide the cases into age groups and found that if cystic disease had been manifested in the twenties, the likelihood of subsequent cancer was vastly greater than if the first evidence of disease did not appear until the forties or fifties. In the latter age group the incidence of subsequent cancer was almost identical with that of a control population.We have a young woman who had such a diagnosis made in relation to her breast. It was removed, and she reappeared rather promptly with an area in the other breast. This had first put in its appearance as a painful area. Nothing is said in the record about whether the pain was related to the menstrual cycle in any way. I am inclined to believe that probably it was, because most cases of breast pain that do not have a mass associated with them are apt to manifest themselves in the week or ten days prior to the menstrual period, and then diminish considerably with the onset of the period. She was examined, and nothing was found in the breast. Presumably, a thorough search was made because she had symptoms directing attention to that area. It does not say whether the examining physician elicited any tenderness in that part of the breast, but it seems very likely since that was the area in which she complained of pain. However, the record says that during examination no mass was observed.Now we come to the brief physical examination that described the mass, but descriptions of masses made by someone else are rarely satisfactory. I suppose nowhere is it more necessary to have one's own hand conduct an examination and then interpret the findings than in the examination of an ambiguous lump. It was well enough defined so that a guess about the measurements could be hazarded. She had an area of induration presumably in the same area where she had discomfort. The location in the outer upper quadrant is significant, since that is where patients more often have painful nodularity or the manifestation of sclerosing adenosis or cystic mastitis. That is the usual site, because that quadrant is the one that contains the largest amount of breast tissue. Nothing is said about the axilla, and we might assume that the axilla showed no metastases. That is as far as I can go on that. The rest is pure conjecture. All I can say is that we have, I think, very wisely adopted the attitude that every lump in the breast may be a cancer and that the only safe assumption is that it is a cancer until the pathologist says it is not. The general policy we have in relation to breast tumors in this hospital, and again I say it is a wise one, is that all such lumps are to be subject to exploration without undue delay. It used to be said that there is no good Indian but a dead Indian. We could modify this and say the only place for a lump in the breast is in a bottle in the pathology laboratory. As long as a woman is harboring or may be harboring a cancer, immediate operation is warranted. Also, of the major cancers that affect mankind, cancer of the breast, if caught at an early stage, offers one of the most favorable prognoses of any type of malignant neoplasm. Therefore, if I were seeing this patient, I would say, \"I cannot tell you what it is. It does not matter what I think it is. The important thing is that it is possible it may be cancer. Therefore, you should submit to exploration without delay and I will put it up to a pathologist. If it is not cancer, if it is benign, you will have the peace of mind that comes from the knowledge that it is benign. You will not be subjected to undue mutilation. [It would be harder to convince this patient on that point, because of the experience of the previous simple exploration with its unfortunate results.] You will be able to resume your usual activities in at least a week, if not sooner, and you will go on your way rejoicing that you do not have cancer.\"If I were further pressed by this particular patient, or a member of the family, I would say: \"No, I do not think we are dealing with cancer in this case.\" Why? Because none of the positive evidence of cancer or the presumptive physical evidence was present. Here is a mass that had developed rapidly from being not observed at all to being 2 or 3 cm. in size. It was first manifested by pain. There was no adherence and no distortion \u2014 only an area of induration described as an area of thickening. Again, one would want to feel it with one's own fingers to interpret it, but to me it is just a thickness that is not characteristic of cancer. In view of the fact that she had previously had sclerosing adenosis and mastitis in the opposite breast, I should think that this was a further manifestation of the same disease, which is of obscure etiology. Whether Dr. Nathanson will relate it to hormonal disturbances, whether it was of vascular origin or on what basis it originated, I am unable to say. But, I think it is going to be again the same thing that was found in the opposite breast.Dr. Tracy B. Mallory: Dr. Bartlett, will you describe your findings?Dr. Marshall K. Bartlett: Naturally, it was very distressing to have this patient come back after operation with a residual mass in her breast. Because we had a pathological report of a benign lesion, it seemed safe to experiment a little with hormonal therapy, but it failed to produce any significant change in the lesion. During this period the patient and her family were not happy about the situation and presently sought the opinion of another surgeon. He observed it for a time and then finding a bluish discoloration of the skin, he aspirated it, and got some blood out of it that led him to the conclusion that probably it was an old hematoma, and as related in the record, she was admitted for evacuation of the hematoma. At that time, the bleeding encountered was so massive that operation was limited to biopsy of the tissue. As a result of the report of that biopsy, the patient was seen by several consultants and, on their advice, I finally did a radical mastectomy on her. Her convalescence was uneventful, and she was well for several months, as you have been told. She finally came back complaining of the other breast in which I could find no lesion, but for obvious reasons I suggested re-examination in a few weeks. At that time there was a mass. This mass was then excised, and immediate pathological examination made. There was no evidence of carcinoma. However, when the final sections came through an opinion was expressed that led to a radical mastectomy on the opposite side.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Mallory: This case represents complete failure on the part of the Department of Pathology, and of me personally, to detect a malignant lesion of the breast. When Dr. Bartlett explored the first lesion in the left breast, I was present at the operation, and the tissue seemed so obviously benign that I did not consider it necessary to do a frozen section. We then put through a paraffin section and did find, as reported, adenosis.At the time of the recurrence and the second biopsy, it became obvious that there was a malignant tumor, of endothelial origin, present in the breast.Dr. Joseph C. Aub: Which breast?Dr. Mallory: The left breast. It was a hemangioma growing with rapidity, so that we had to classify it as a hemangiosarcoma. At that time the radical mastectomy was done. The subsequent recurrence in the second breast was identical. Again, the biopsy looked perfectly benign grossly but on microscopical examination had the same type of malignant vascular tumor in it. When the recurrence appeared in the first breast, we went back to the original biopsy and found in one corner of one of our slides a little area, which had we paid attention to it, we should have recognized certainly as a hemangioma, if not as a malignant one.Dr. Richard H. Wallace: Was the axilla involved on either side?Dr. Mallory: No, there was considerable question on both occasions whether or not radical mastectomy should be done. Very often these hemangiomas do invade the pectoral muscles. It was believed that if one was going to remove the pectoral muscles it did not add much to the operation to dissect the axilla.Have you any comment, Dr. Taylor?Dr. Taylor: No, except that I am pleased to take a nose dive in such good company.A Physician: How long has it been since operation?Dr. Bartlett: About a year. The patient is all right at the present time.Dr. Taylor: Was the second tumor an independent primary tumor or a metastasis?Dr. Mallory: I believe it was independent. It was in the other breast, and on the far side. If the recurrence had been close to the line of the original incision, one would think otherwise.Dr. Ira T. Nathanson: I saw this patient with Dr. Bartlett. The lesion in the right breast was a ringer for sclerosing or blunt duct adenosis. We could not make a diagnosis of hemangiosarcoma although we entertained it in view of the findings in the left breast. Consequently, we decided to explore the area in order to establish the diagnosis.The various types of sarcomas of the breast rarely metastasize to lymph nodes but usually spread through the blood stream, commonly to the lungs. Hence, simple mastectomy has been ordinarily considered adequate to control the local disease. However, sarcomas of the breast, particularly of hemangiomatous origin, may invade the pectoral muscles. This was seen on the left side, where radical mastectomy was performed for this type of invasion. Similarly, it was our opinion that radical mastectomy on the right side was also the procedure of choice in this patient, who was in excellent physical condition. It was considered that the slight additional risk was minor in comparison with the possibility of leaving residual disease in the muscle if simple mastectomy was elected.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Andrew S. Hoekzema\n(Medicine): An 83-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in the winter because of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and confusion.\nOne week before admission, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and nonproductive cough developed. The patient felt feverish but did not measure her temperature at home. No family members or recent contacts had been ill. Two days before admission, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed. One day before admission, the patient asked her daughter repetitive questions and appeared to not recognize family members. On the day of admission, the patient reported global weakness and was brought by her daughter to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported no headache, changes in vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. She had a history of rheumatic heart disease, with mitral-valve stenosis and regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction of 60%. Other medical history included osteoporosis, compression fracture of thoracic vertebrae, and chronic kidney disease with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg per deciliter (106 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 50 ml per minute per 1.73 m\n2\nof body-surface area (reference range, >60) according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. Fifteen years earlier, she had undergone open mitral-valve commissurotomy and ring annuloplasty, procedures that were complicated by the development of recurrent severe mitral-valve regurgitation, which led to pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis, and severe tricuspid-valve regurgitation. Nine years earlier, she had undergone bioprosthetic mitral-valve replacement and tricuspid-valve reconstruction with annuloplasty, with placement of a permanent pacemaker for persistent atrial fibrillation with bradycardia. Eight years earlier, transthoracic echocardiography had revealed a well-seated prosthetic mitral valve, an annular ring in the tricuspid position, mild tricuspid-valve regurgitation, and normal right ventricular size and function. In addition, 10 years earlier, a cholecystectomy had been performed.\nThe patient lived at home with one of her grown children, was independent in activities of daily living, and walked for 30 minutes daily. Medications included furosemide, spironolactone, metoprolol, digoxin, and warfarin. She took her daily medications from a pillbox organizer that her daughter filled on a weekly basis. Warfarin therapy was monitored monthly with measurement of the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio; almost all results had been in the therapeutic range. The patient was born in Uganda but had moved to New England when she was 64 years of age to live with her children. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 153/60 mm Hg, the pulse 64 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 39.2 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 18.7. The patient was cachectic and appeared ill. She was awake but lethargic, and she responded to questions with nonsensical answers in her native language. She intermittently followed simple one-step commands and could move her arms and legs. Results of cranial-nerve examinations were normal (although the function of the first cranial nerve was not tested). The mucous membranes were dry. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender on palpation. The cardiac rhythm was irregularly irregular, with a loud S\n2\nheart sound and a systolic murmur throughout the precordium; the jugular vein was nondistended. Crackles were present in the lower lung fields. There was no leg edema. The complete blood count was normal, as were results of liver-function tests and blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, and lipase. Urinalysis was normal, except for the presence of 1+ ketones (reference range, negative). Nucleic acid testing of a nasal-swab specimen for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nDr. Victorine V. Muse:\nChest radiography (\nFigure 1\n) revealed wires associated with median sternotomy, a single-lead pacemaker on the left side of the heart, and evidence of mitral-valve and tricuspid-valve repairs. There was evidence of stable, massive, global cardiomegaly and mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prominent ventricles and sulci, as well as nonspecific, scattered periventricular white-matter hypodensities; there was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, large territorial infarction, or intracranial mass lesion.\nDr. Hoekzema:\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital, and a diagnostic test was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Melissa L.P. Mattison:* This 83-year-old woman was brought by her family to this hospital for an evaluation of global weakness in the context of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which began to occur after she had had symptoms that were suggestive of an upper respiratory infection for several days. She was newly unable to recognize family members and to answer questions. Using the common classification of organ failure as acute, chronic, or acute-on-chronic, I would characterize her condition as acute brain failure.[1,2](#core-r1)The patient\u2019s daughter had set out the patient\u2019s pills, but I do not know whether she did this because the patient was no longer capable of doing so owing to cognitive impairment or because the patient had a low level of health literacy or language-barrier issues. Although the patient clearly had an acute alteration of mental status, I would need more background information to determine whether her current condition could represent an acute-on-chronic process. Regardless, the features of her presentation are consistent with delirium according to the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) definition.[3](#core-r3) She had acute inattention (intermittent following of commands), disorganized thinking (inability to recognize family members), and an altered level of consciousness (global weakness and lethargy).\n### Delirium\n\nThe diagnosis of delirium in this patient is a cause for alarm, since delirium is associated with increased mortality during hospitalization[4,5](#core-r4) and at 1 year after diagnosis.[6](#core-r6) The most important step after the recognition of delirium is to identify the underlying cause, which involves consideration of common reversible conditions that have been described in hospitalized older adults.[7](#core-r7)\n### Drugs\n\nMedications are a common cause of delirium, particularly in older adults. Although this patient was receiving warfarin, her international normalized ratio was almost always in the therapeutic range, indicating that she had adhered to the prescription and seemed to have taken the medication correctly. Although psychoactive drugs had not been prescribed in the patient, she took multiple medications \u2014 including anticoagulants, diuretics, and several cardiac medications \u2014 that increased her risk of adverse drug events. Withdrawal syndromes can cause delirium, but this patient did not drink alcohol or use medications, such as benzodiazepines, that are associated with withdrawal syndromes. However, it remains possible that a drug effect could have contributed to her delirium.\n### Electrolyte and Metabolic Disturbances\n\nThis patient\u2019s calcium level is not reported, but she had mild hyponatremia and her urinalysis was notable for the presence of ketones. On physical examination, she had dry mucous membranes and no leg edema or jugular venous distention. Taken together, these findings are suggestive of volume depletion. I suspect her hyponatremia was due to an inadequate effective arterial blood volume, leading to the ongoing release of antidiuretic hormone. The hyponatremia was not severe enough to fully explain her delirium, but it can be a marker of underlying volume depletion, which can contribute to delirium.This patient\u2019s glucose level was normal. The thyrotropin level is not available, but she did not have symptoms that were suggestive of either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The combination of hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and global weakness can indicate adrenal insufficiency, a very uncommon cause of delirium that may also explain the nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. However, the absence of hypotension makes adrenal insufficiency unlikely.\n### Cardiopulmonary Disorders\n\nCardiac and pulmonary disorders can lead to delirium through hypoxemia or hypercarbia. Although I do not have access to results of tests of arterial blood gases for this patient, there is no history of lung disease that would raise suspicion for these abnormalities. In addition, I have not seen the results of electrocardiography for this patient, but she did not report chest pain and she had a normal troponin T level, and these findings make myocardial infarction unlikely. She had evidence of rales on pulmonary auscultation, mild pulmonary vascular congestion on chest radiography, and an elevated level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide, findings that indicate a component of congestive heart failure. However, her oxygen saturation was normal, and thus it is unlikely that a cardiac or pulmonary process would be the main driver of her delirium.\n### Infection\n\nInfection involving the central nervous system is a serious consideration in patients with delirium, especially those with an abnormal neurologic examination or with no more likely cause of the condition. It is reassuring that this patient\u2019s neurologic examination was unremarkable and that the history did not raise concerns about seizure activity. In addition, non\u2013contrast-enhanced CT of the head revealed only prominent ventricles and nonspecific periventricular white-matter hypodensities.Infections outside the central nervous system can also lead to delirium. Two common culprits, urinary tract infection and pneumonia, are unlikely in the absence of pyuria and of consolidation on chest radiography, respectively. Although this patient had no known sick contacts, she presented in the winter after she had had an upper respiratory infection. Tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were negative, but other influenza-like illnesses remain possible. More remotely acquired infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infections, are also possible in this patient who had emigrated from Uganda 19 years before admission. Weight loss is not reported, but she was described as being cachectic and she had a BMI of 18.7 (with values of <18.5 indicating underweight status).[8](#core-r8) However, she had normally walked for 30 minutes daily, indicating that she was physically robust, so perhaps she was just a very thin person.\n### Narrowing the Differential Diagnosis\n\nCan any features of this case help us to determine the most likely diagnosis? The most striking laboratory finding is the blood creatinine level of 1.6 mg per deciliter (141 \u03bcmol per liter), which had increased from a baseline level of 1.2 mg per deciliter and is consistent with acute kidney injury. However, despite the normal baseline blood creatinine level, this patient also had chronic kidney disease with a reduced estimated GFR.The GFR decreases naturally with age, even in the absence of renal disease, with a 35% decrease between 20 years and 70 years of age.[9,10](#core-r9) Estimating the GFR is difficult, particularly in people with an older age, low muscle mass, or a low-protein diet.[10](#core-r10) Because creatinine comes from muscle, people with lower muscle mass should normally have a lower blood creatinine level. In this patient, the baseline estimated GFR according to the MDRD formula was 50 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, a finding consistent with stage 3A chronic kidney disease. However, this estimated GFR is inaccurate, since the MDRD formula assumes a body-surface area of 1.73 m2. Because this patient weighed 39.2 kg, she would need to be more than 7 ft (2.15 m) tall to have a body-surface area of 1.73 m2. She had a BMI of 18.7 and a height of 4 ft 9 in. (1.45 m), and she most likely had a very low muscle mass. The Cockcroft\u2013Gault equation can also be used to calculate creatinine clearance in estimating the GFR. This equation takes weight into account and can be helpful in patients whose weight is extremely low. According to the Cockcroft\u2013Gault equation, this patient\u2019s baseline creatinine clearance was 22 ml per minute, indicating stage 4 chronic kidney disease.The combination of chronic kidney disease, acute renal failure, and older age increases this patient\u2019s risk of adverse drug events. Adverse drug events are common, occurring in at least 5% of hospitalized patients,[11,12](#core-r11) and they are more common among patients in the outpatient setting. Medications that commonly cause adverse events include oral hypoglycemic agents, oral anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, and opiates. This patient was taking spironolactone, which is contraindicated in patients older than 65 years who have a creatinine clearance of less than 35 ml per minute and is associated with ataxia, confusion, lethargy, hyperkalemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and acute kidney injury.[13](#core-r13) Another possible cause of this patient\u2019s condition is digoxin toxicity, which is characterized by confusion, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, and visual disturbances.[14](#core-r14) The major route of elimination of digoxin is through renal excretion, and the blood level of digoxin can rise in the context of a reduced GFR. Approximately 20 to 30% of digoxin is bound to blood albumin, and factors such as older age, congestive heart failure, and renal failure reduce the volume of distribution, contributing to an increased risk of toxic effects.This patient did not have the ataxia that is associated with spironolactone toxicity or the visual disturbances that are associated with digoxin toxicity, but otherwise, the features of her presentation fit well with both conditions. Therefore, drug toxicity, probably from digoxin, is the most likely diagnosis in this case. I suspect the diagnostic test was an immunoassay to determine the blood digoxin level.*Dr. Meridale Baggett* (Medicine): Dr. Simmons, what was your clinical impression when you initially evaluated this patient?*Dr. Leigh H. Simmons:* This patient had been under my care for several years, but I saw her in the office very infrequently after she lost Medicaid coverage, which was not reinstated for unclear reasons. Despite our requests that her family bring her in for routine checks and for assistance with exploring options for health insurance, her family declined to do so because of concerns about the cost of medical visits. Through our anticoagulation-management service, her international normalized ratio was checked regularly and was nearly always in the therapeutic range. Her family consistently refilled her medicines, which were available in generic form and were relatively inexpensive.When the patient presented to the emergency department, I learned from her attentive daughters that she had been doing well at home until this sudden decline and that they thought she had a viral illness. I was especially concerned, because the patient rarely sought medical attention for illnesses. During my initial assessment in the emergency department, I thought a viral illness could have precipitated heart failure or renal failure. However, her confusion was the most worrisome feature of her presentation, and it prompted me to consider the possibility of digoxin toxicity and to request a digoxin immunoassay.\n\nDiagnostic Testing\n------------------\n\n*Dr. Rory K. Crotty:* The diagnostic test in this case was a digoxin immunoassay. Testing of a blood sample obtained in the emergency department revealed a digoxin level of 9.0 ng per milliliter (therapeutic range, 0.9 to 2.0). The international normalized ratio was more than 16.The digoxin level is frequently monitored because of the narrow therapeutic range and the potential for serious adverse drug events. This patient was also taking spironolactone, which has historically been reported to interfere with testing of the digoxin level by acting as a digoxin-like immunoreactive substance. The term digoxin-like immunoreactive substance encompasses a broad range of substances, both exogenous and endogenous in origin, that may interfere with digoxin immunoassays.[14](#core-r14) Endogenous digoxin-like immunoreactive substances may be found in patients with volume expansion and appear to have natriuretic effects. Exogenous digoxin-like immunoreactive substances include spironolactone, canrenone, and Chinese herbal medications. However, spironolactone and related medications are not known to cause interference with the current generation of digoxin immunoassays that are used at this hospital.In cases in which the desired diagnostic test is a digoxin immunoassay, a blood sample must be obtained before the administration of digoxin-binding antibody fragments. The digoxin level cannot be meaningfully measured until these antibody fragments are eliminated from the body, which may take days to more than a week in patients with severe kidney dysfunction.\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Christopher Newton-Cheh:* I met this patient shortly after her emigration from Uganda, 19 years before this admission. She reportedly had had persistent atrial fibrillation for years, which was not surprising given her symptomatic mitral-valve stenosis, left atrial enlargement, and resultant scarring from chronic pressure overload. I presume that digoxin and a beta-blocker had initially been prescribed in Uganda for control of the heart rate in the context of atrial fibrillation and that these treatments were continued when heart failure subsequently developed.Cardiac glycosides, such as digoxin, were first used for the treatment of heart failure many years ago,[15](#core-r15) well before the molecular actions of these drugs were understood. If this patient presented today with atrial fibrillation and heart failure, it is unlikely that digoxin would be prescribed. The use of digoxin therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation has decreased as alternative therapeutic approaches with greater efficacy and reduced toxic effects have been recognized. Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers slow the ventricular response at rest and during exertion. Digoxin is sometimes added if these agents do not adequately control the heart rate at maximal doses. However, the vagotonic effect of digoxin is overcome by the adrenergic surge that occurs during exercise, and therefore, digoxin is of limited use in preventing uncontrolled heart rates during exercise. The use of digoxin for the treatment of heart failure has also decreased because of the rise of more effective and less toxic therapies, including angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, neprilysin\u2013angiotensin-receptor inhibitors, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists. A trial conducted by the Digitalis Investigation Group did not show a benefit from digoxin with respect to mortality in patients with symptomatic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, and the trial results also suggested harm from digoxin when it was present at high levels in the blood.[16](#core-r16)The administration of digoxin-binding antibody fragments (i.e., digoxin immune Fab) is not necessarily indicated for several nuisance consequences of digoxin toxicity, including xanthopsia (yellow vision), nausea, bradycardia, and confusion. Life-threatening consequences of digoxin toxicity include ventricular tachycardia, severe bradycardia, complete heart block, and shock. The administration of digoxin immune Fab, which binds to digoxin and clears the drug from tissues, is indicated for the treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias and shock, as well as for the prevention of these events when hyperkalemia is present.This patient had a blood potassium level of more than 5 mmol per liter, which is associated with an increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias or death. She was treated with digoxin immune Fab; the dose was calculated on the basis of the blood digoxin level and body weight with the use of a dosing nomogram for chronic toxicity. Adverse events associated with the administration of digoxin immune Fab include heart failure, hypokalemia, and hypersensitivity to ovine Fab epitopes; none of these events occurred in this patient.[17](#core-r17)*Dr. Simmons:* Before the patient was discharged from the hospital, we performed a careful assessment of her home situation. We learned that some memory deficits had developed in the patient and that her daughters were concerned that she had not been managing her medicines well. Her daughters did not think that this was a suicide attempt, and once the patient\u2019s mental status had improved, information obtained during an interview did not suggest depression. However, a cognitive evaluation indicated that she had deficits in short-term memory and executive functioning. Warfarin and digoxin were discontinued, and apixaban was initiated for stroke prevention. Medicaid coverage was reinstated. The patient was discharged home. Adjustments have been made to the doses of diuretics for heart failure, but otherwise, her medical condition has been stable. During the 12 months after her hospital stay, she had 19 telephone calls and 11 scheduled or urgent office visits to primary care and cardiology but had no hospitalizations or emergency department visits.Our experience with this patient highlights several of the well-studied health consequences of being uninsured. Avoidable causes of death occur disproportionately in patients who do not have health insurance. Patients who regain insurance after being previously uninsured start to use outpatient services more often (as this patient did). Studies suggest that there are mortality benefits from acquiring health insurance.[18](#core-r18) For me, the particularly distressing component of this patient\u2019s story is that she had survived a complex cardiac operation and had undergone advanced cardiac procedures, including pacemaker placement, only to subsequently lose access to her regular health coverage. Routine visits for primary care before this admission might have resulted in conversations about her cognitive functioning and her ability to manage medicines on her own, as well as a review of essential medications and perhaps the discontinuation of higher-risk medications, such as digoxin.*A Physician:* What did this patient\u2019s initial electrocardiogram show?*Dr. Randall M. Zusman* (Cardiology): I cared for this patient at the hospital. The electrocardiogram obtained on admission ([Figure 2](#f2)) showed an underlying rhythm of atrial fibrillation with ventricular-demand pacing at a rate of 60 beats per minute. When atrioventricular conduction was present, there was evidence of a regularized ventricular response that was consistent with an excess of digoxin, but the ST-segment changes were more consistent with the underlying conduction-system disease than with classic digoxin toxicity. After digoxin immune Fab was administered, the patient was less dependent on the pacemaker; the cardiac rhythm was more irregular and the delay in the conduction system was less marked. In this case, the diagnosis of digoxin toxicity was based on the clinical features of an electrolyte disorder, acute renal insufficiency, and the suspected inadvertent administration of an excess of digoxin rather than on the development of classic findings on electrocardiography.\n",

      "question": "First admission\n. A 24-year-old woman was admitted to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary because of discomfort in the throat, hoarseness and nocturnal dyspnea and stridor.\nFour months previously she began to notice fullness in the throat. Six weeks before admission she became increasingly hoarse, particularly on awakening in the morning, and experienced dyspnea on exertion and difficulty in swallowing. She received tetracycline, without relief. One month before entry numerous cervical lymph nodes became enlarged. Three weeks later examination at another hospital revealed edema of the larynx and left side of the palate. She failed to improve after the administration of ampicillin and the use of a dexamethasone spray.\nSix years before admission intermittent crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea developed, accompanied by weight loss. An upper gastrointestinal series with small-bowel follow-through study at another hospital revealed nodular and edematous changes in the terminal 30 cm of the ileum, consistent with Crohn's disease. Tetracycline and diphenoxalate hydrochloride with atropine sulfate were administered. Subsequently, remissions and exacerbations occurred, particularly after the ingestion of spicy foods or after a period of tension, but no attacks were as severe as the initial one. Six years before admission she had a two-month illness characterized by pharyngitis, lymphadenitis and splenomegaly and diagnosed as infectious mononucleosis. She had no further cervical problems until three years later, when she began to experience episodes of bilateral tender enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes, including the submandibular nodes, approximately every three months.\nTwo years before admission she was admitted to another hospital because of abnormal vaginal bleeding. A laparotomy revealed an ovarian cyst. On the third postoperative day bilobar pneumonia developed; it resolved completely after treatment. She was told that she had had \"bronchitis\" preoperatively, which predisposed to the postoperative pneumonia. She had been taking oral contraceptives for 18 months. She smoked 3/4 of a package of cigarettes a day and sniffed hashish. She also smoked marijuana frequently before the onset of the recent illness but discontinued it because it aggravated her symptoms. There was no history of recent pain, cough, fever, trauma, exposure to toxins or tuberculosis, foreign-body aspiration, allergies or bleeding tendency. The family history was negative for inflammatory bowel disease and allergy.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 88, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 80/58 mm Hg.\nExamination was negative except for inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, edema without erythema of the nasopharynx and soft palate and marked edema and pallor of the right arytenoid, which moved only minimally. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Mild clubbing of the fingers was observed.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 34 per cent; the white-cell count was 9800, with 80 per cent neutrophils. The eosinophil count was 243 per cubic millimeter. The corrected erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 26 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg, the glucose 110 mg, and the protein 6.7 g (the albumin 4.4 g, and the globulin 2.3 g) per 100 ml. Tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies and an L.E.-cell test were negative. Agarose-gel electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis and a quantitative immunoglobulin determination yielded normal results; the C3 was 88 mg, and the C1 inhibitor 3.14 mg per 100 ml. Skin testing was strongly positive for streptokinase-streptodornase and candida antigens; a PPD, 5 TU test was negative. Skin tests demonstrated no sensitivity to house dust or alternaria. An x-ray film of the chest was normal. Soft-tissue films of the neck (\nFig. 1\n) demonstrated thickening of the epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds and marked thickening of the arytenoids; there was a suggestion of fullness of the false cords; the prevertebral soft tissues appeared normal. Tomographic studies confirmed these findings and revealed that the true cords appeared normal. Fluoroscopic examination disclosed symmetrical movement of the cords; barium flowed from the mouth into the esophagus without difficulty; there was no reflux into the nasopharynx, but slight aspiration of contrast material into the larynx was observed; the esophagus appeared normal.\nMethylprednisolone, 4 mg three times a day, was administered by mouth, without relief. The patient awoke occasionally at night with mild difficulty in breathing, which was relieved quickly by a change in position.\nA biopsy from the edge of the soft palate adjacent to the uvula on the left side revealed chronic inflammation. On the fifth hospital day direct laryngoscopic examination disclosed that the epiglottis was bright-pink and thickened to three times the normal size; the true vocal cords, the subglottic space, the piriform sinuses, the postcricoid space and the cervical esophagus appeared normal; the right arytenoid was three times the normal size, and the left one and a half times the normal size, pink and soft; no foreign bodies or lacerations were noted in the larynx or hypopharynx. Biopsies of the tongue, epiglottis and right arytenoid were performed, and the patient was discharged on the eighth hospital day.\nSecond admission\n(five months later). Prednisone, up to 55 mg administered on alternate days, resulted in improvement of symptoms but was discontinued by the patient after six weeks because of fear of side effects. Two months before admission the right knee became painful. Other complaints included pain in the right elbow, fatigue, intermittent fever, dysuria and urgency and watery diarrhea, occasionally accompanied by pain; the ingestion of dairy products resulted in abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Examination one month before entry revealed edema of the uvula and soft palate. She was hoarse except when she spoke vigorously. She complained of difficulty in swallowing. There was no lymphadenopathy. Internal rotation of the right hip produced slight discomfort. The hematocrit was 35.9 per cent, and the white-cell count 8600, with 61 per cent neutrophils. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 30 mm per hour; the uric acid was 4.7 mg per 100 ml. The serum muramidase was 115 U (normal, 58 to 90 U) per milliliter. A culture of urine yielded no growth. A lateral film of the neck showed reversal of the normal cervical curvature; there was no unusual soft-tissue swelling in the posterior nasopharynx or anterior to the cervical spine. Films of the right elbow and right knee demonstrated no soft-tissue or bony abnormalities, but the joint space of the knee appeared somewhat narrower medially than laterally. Films of the chest were normal. The joint symptoms cleared, but four days before admission the dyspnea and hoarseness worsened; indomethacin, 25 mg three times a day, was prescribed. The dyspnea continued to become more severe, occurring at rest, and was accompanied by stridor, dysphagia and aspiration of food.\nThe temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the pulse 74, and the respirations 21. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg.\nExamination was negative except for marked edema without erythema of the soft palate (\nFig. 2\n), floor of the mouth, epiglottis and arytenoids. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Dexamethasone, 8 mg, was administered intravenously and subsequently intramuscularly every six hours at the same dosage for three days, when it was replaced by prednisone, 10 mg taken orally per day. A throat culture was negative. An x-ray film of the chest was normal. Films of the neck disclosed a considerable increase in the edema of the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds and arytenoids in comparison with the films obtained five months earlier, as well as edema of the true and false cords; the laryngeal ventricle was almost completely obliterated; no subglottic mass was demonstrated. An upper gastrointestinal series with small-bowel follow-through study (\nFig. 3\n) disclosed a normal appearance of the stomach and upper small bowel; there was inconstant narrowing of the distal ileum, with mucosal edema, nodular folds and marginal serrations for 20 to 30 cm. A barium-enema examination revealed no abnormalities of the colon.\nA biopsy was performed on the sixth hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Paul H. Ward\\*: May we see the x-ray films?Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: A film from the small-bowel study six years before the recent admission demonstrates barium opacifying two or three loops of the distal ileum, which appear abnormal, with nodular thickening and granular effacement of the mucosal pattern and irregular marginal serrations. This appearance was considered consistent with regional enteritis. A film from the small-bowel study performed on the second admission ([Fig. 3](#f003)), just before the second biopsy, again shows abnormality confined to the distal ileum. It is characterized by inconstant areas of narrowing reflecting a moderate amount of spasm. In addition, there is evidence of bowel-wall thickening, with loops of small bowel separated from one another. A spot film from the barium-enema examination reveals the same granular appearance of the mucosa with marginal serrations and diffuse nodular thickening of the folds. The chronicity of this process is typical of Crohn's disease, and the involvement appears localized to the distal 20 or 30 cm of the ileum.The films of the upper airway obtained on the first admission to this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) demonstrate marked enlargement of the epiglottis, with obliteration of the air space in the vallecula at the base of the tongue. The arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds are also edematous and indistinct, filling much of the space of the supraglottic larynx. Diffuse swelling is also evident in the region of the false cords. There is no apparent widening of the pretracheal soft tissues. The laminagrams confirm these findings and disclose no enlargement of the vocal cords. The films from a barium-swallow study show slight aspiration of barium into the supraglottic portion of the larynx. No abnormality is seen in the barium-filled esophagus.Dr. Ward: Please present the photographs of the palate and pharynx.Dr. Newton E. Hyslop, Jr.: The clinical findings were unusual. There was no edema of the face or the mucous membranes of the lips. However, the floor of the mouth was elevated by edema, which had the appearance of a noninflammatory lymphedema. There was no induration, and the involved mucosa appeared pale. In the posterior third of the mouth the soft palate and the uvula were edematous ([Fig. 2](#f002)); the edema of the soft palate was greater on one side than on the other.Dr. Ward: In view of the many striking signs and symptoms and the sparsity of contributory laboratory data I must rely on the history and the physical examination as the basis for the differential diagnosis. The major abnormalities in this case were in two areas \u2014 the distal ileum and the region of the pharynx and larynx. In addition, there were numerous ancillary problems involving other areas.The patient obviously had multiple-system involvement. The pneumonia might indicate pulmonary involvement, although it was a postoperative development and probably of minimal importance in the differential diagnosis. The waxing and waning of the lymphadenopathy was a striking feature. The previous episode of pharyngitis, lymphadenitis and splenomegaly may have been a manifestation of the same general systemic disorder. The dyspnea on exertion could have been of cardiopulmonary origin or due to obstruction of the larynx. The aggravation of the hoarseness on awakening can be explained on the basis of increased stasis edema in addition to relaxation of the tongue and epiglottis with these structures falling back to occlude the larynx. Whenever she awoke and changed posture the airway was reopened. The dyspnea could have been pulmonary in origin, although if so it must have been mild because the x-ray films of the chest were normal after that initial episode. The ovarian cyst that was found two years previously was probably unrelated to the recent illness. We are told that the pharyngitis was exacerbated by the use of marijuana. I don't know of anysuch association, although certainly any irritation in the nasopharynx can be made worse by indulgence in marijuana or hashish. The mild clubbing of the fingers may have been due to pulmonary disease, liver disease or possibly some type of congenital abnormality. Intermittent fever, dysuria and watery diarrhea were other symptoms of her disease.What are the possibilities to be considered in the differential diagnosis of the two major problems in this case? With regard to the stricture of the terminal ileum, the radiologic evidence and the six-year history are typical of Crohn's disease, or regional enteritis. Other processes that cause narrowing of the terminal ileum have been delineated in recent years and merit mention in passing. Amyloidosis can produce such a change. Carcinoid is a possibility, although one would expect metastatic carcinoid to the larynx to be manifested by other symptoms and signs, such as flushing and cutaneous changes. Lymphoma is the only malignant tumor that could account for both of these problems, but the chronicity of the disease, with waxing and waning, and the failure to respond to steroids are against that diagnosis. Sarcoidosis is another disease that could be responsible for this picture, but there is no other evidence pointing to that disease. A vasculitis, particularly with involvement of the terminal vessels of the ileum, could result in these changes. Involvement of other vessels can produce a protean clinical picture, causing symptoms in many areas of the body. A recently described infection, due to *Yersinia pseudotuberculosis*, has been reported as a cause of constriction of the terminal ileum. Tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis and blastomycosis are all granulomatous infections that can produce a similar picture, although in the absence of fever it is unlikely that any of those infections were responsible for this woman's illness.The features outlined in this case are typical of Crohn's disease. Perhaps the strongest point in its favor is the description by the patient that the ingestion of dairy products resulted in abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Most gastroenterologists consider such a history more reliable than all the laboratory tests that corroborate the diagnosis. The intolerance of spicy foods and the relapses and exacerbations also fit with this diagnosis. The radiologic findings, the normal vital signs, the increased sedimentation rate, the normal serum protein values and the elevated serum muramidase level are all characteristic. I have not seen oral lesions in association with Crohn's disease, but lesions of the gums have been described. So I suppose that any area in the oral cavity or pharynx can be involved.The symptoms related to the laryngopharyngeal area had been present for only four months, in contrast to the six-year history of the gastrointestinal problem. The patient's complaints were fullness in the throat, increasing hoarseness, stridor, dyspnea, progressive difficulty in swallowing, aspiration and edema of the palate, which was asymmetrical. She failed to respond to antibiotics and responded only intermittently and questionably to steroids. Asymmetrical edema of the palate is relatively unusual since most inflammatory reactions are symmetrical. Important features in regard to the diagnosis were the unrelenting progression of the symptoms and the appearance of the larynx, laryngopharynx and palate. What are the possibilities to be considered? From the description it seems clear that the process was inflammatory rather than neoplastic. As far as inflammatory lesions are concerned, angioneurotic edema was tested for, and the findings were equivocal. The lack of marked erythema or edema in the palate is evidence against infection and most inflammatory reactions. An infection due to tubercle bacilli, yersinia and various fungal organisms should have produced a granulomatous appearance of the larynx, whereas the laryngeal swelling was described as pale, pink and smooth in this patient. There is no history of trauma as a cause of the findings.For completeness, I must mention other possible diagnoses. Syphilis, the great mimicker, can cause signs and symptoms anywhere in the body. This young woman with her smoking of hashish and probable other indulgences of modern-day society may have had the opportunity to contract it. That diagnosis seems unlikely, however. The collagen and vascular diseases must always be considered in a patient with multiple-system involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus as well as polyarteritis nodosa and other types of vasculitis are possibilities in this case. All the symptoms could be explained on the basis of one of these diseases, but one would expect more positive laboratory findings. Since I did not palpate the edema of the tissues I am not certain of the nature of the changes in the larynx. Therefore, I cannot confidently eliminate any of these diagnostic possibilities. My first choice, however, is Crohn's disease with accompanying amyloidosis. Less probable is Crohn's disease with granulomatous changes in both the ileum and the pharynx.A Physician: Would you consider the possibility of food allergy?Dr. Ward: It is difficult to attribute the findings to an allergic reaction. The patient had no history of allergy and had an intact immune system as indicated by the negative protein studies.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Mulvaney, you followed this patient through most of the course of her illness. Will you tell us your impressions?Dr. Thomas J. Mulvaney: The patchy edema fluctuated in degree but never disappeared. The floor of the mouth was edematous for a two-week period during the early months of evaluation.Dr. Scully: Dr. Hyslop, will you comment on the findings before the diagnostic biopsy was done?Dr. Hyslop: When I saw the patient I was impressed by her unconventional social behavior and raised the question of lymphogranuloma venereum occurring in an unusual location. However, she did not have any regional lymphadenopathy. Another factor, still unresolved, was the possible contribution of local toxicity or hypersensitivity produced by repeated nasal inhalation of hashish or smoking of marijuana, which she observed exacerbated her symptoms. The history of a prior episode of regional enteritis, which had become asymptomatic, was a clue to the possibility of a systemic illness, and the mild clubbing of her fingers as well as the elevated serum muramidase level suggested continued activity of that disease. We also considered in the differential diagnosis chronic epiglottitis of mycotic or mycobacterial cause and chronic epiglottitis produced by *Haemophilus influenzae*. The latter occurs in persons with hypogammaglobulinemia, whereas her immunoglobulin levels were normal. Hereditary angioneurotic edema (HANE) was excluded by finding a high-normal serum level of C1 esterase inhibitor by immunochemical assay. Although this assay does not detect the nonfunctional defective gene product found in about 15 per cent of the cases of HANE, the patient's epiglottal edema was chronic in contrast to the episodic bouts of noninflammatory edema characteristic of that disorder.I concluded that the earlier episode of postoperative pneumonia was probably due to aspiration because of difficulties with clearing secretions after extubation, and that it might have been the first clinical sign of the abnormal upper airway. The later development of dyspnea was unquestionably due to partial airway obstruction by epiglottal and glottal swelling since the x-ray films of the chest remained normal. A relation between changes in hydrostatic pressure and her symptoms was suggested by the fact that the dysphonia was much worse in the morning, improving as the day wore on. This change was apparently related to the assumption of the upright position and suggested chronic lymphatic obstruction. Some of the edema was steroid-sensitive, since high-dose steroids proved effective initially in relieving the two acute exacerbations of airway obstruction.Additional biopsy specimens of the local lesions were obtained for culture and special stains, and the study of the gastrointestinal tract was performed to assess the current activity of the regional enteritis.Dr. Scully: Dr. Wilson, do you wish to comment on the allergic aspect of the problem?Dr. William R. Wilson: The IgE level was normal, making food allergy very unlikely.Dr. Scully: Dr. Maynard, you saw her from the standpoint of the bowel disease. Will you comment?Dr. Edwin P. Maynard, III: The bowel disease was characteristic of regional enteritis, and I believed that it was unnecessary to entertain any other diagnosis to explain the gastrointestinal manifestations. We interpreted the arthritis or arthralgia as a complication of that disease. During the time that I followed her the gastrointestinal problems were minimal, with intermittent mild cramps and diarrhea as her only complaints. The airway disorder was her major complaint. Fortunately, its therapy was also optimal for the inflammatory bowel disease. We see amyloidosis very rarely in this country in association with Crohn's disease. It was more common in the past when chronic suppurative complications of this disease were more often encountered. The question that we raised continually was whether the laryngeal edema was another extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease. We have seen a variety of stomal lesions, such as pyostomatitis vegetans, but I have not heard of laryngeal edema as a complication of Crohn's disease.Dr. Scully: Dr. Donoff, will you comment at this point?Dr. R. Bruce Donoff: When I saw the patient she gave an impressive history of gastrointestinal and joint involvement. The fact that on the previous day I had read a report of two cases of Crohn's disease of the oral cavity[1,2](#core-r001) influenced my thoughts about the problem.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Scully: Dr. Goodman will present the pathological findings.Dr. Max L. Goodman: Microscopical examination of the first biopsy specimen from the soft palate demonstrated marked submucosal edema, lymphatic dilatation and a nonspecific perivascular chronic inflammatory-cell infiltration, with clumps of histiocytes ([Fig. 4](#f004)).The second group of biopsy specimens were from the base of the tongue, the epiglottis and the aryepiglottic fold. Examination showed marked submucosal edema, chronic inflammation and microgranulomas composed of clusters of histiocytes and occasional multinucleated giant cells (Fig. [5](#f005) and [6](#f006)). Lymphoid nodules contained germinal centers, within which were found occasional granulomas. The lymphatics were dilated. Acid-fast and fungal stains were negative for specific organisms. These alterations were interpreted as nonspecific granulomatous inflammation. Such granulomas are characteristic of sarcoidosis but may also be encountered in Crohn's disease. In the presence of clinical and radiologic evidence of Crohn's disease and in the absence of any signs of sarcoidosis the oral and laryngeal inflammatory lesions are interpreted as manifestations of Crohn's disease.Morson[3](#core-r003) has emphasized that the presence of microgranulomas in inflammatory bowel disease is the most characteristic feature of Crohn's disease. Warren and Sommers,[4](#core-r004) analyzing 120 cases of cicatrizing enteritis, stressed the obstructive lymphedema, lymphoid hyperplasia, giant cells in germinal centers and a granulomatous response as characteristic features of Crohn's disease. Truelove and Pe\u00f1a[5](#core-r005) and Chapin et al.[6](#core-r006) have described the secondary lesions in the lymph nodes, liver, skin and joints as complications of Crohn's disease. Fahimi et al.[7](#core-r007) reviewed the relation of granulomatous gastritis to disseminated sarcoidosis and regional enteritis. They accepted evidence of an association with regional enteritis in six cases. Seventeen patients had disseminated sarcoidosis, and 32 had only gastric involvement. Gelfand and Krone[8](#core-r008) and others have reported esophageal involvement in cases of Crohn's disease. Dudeney and Todd[9](#core-r009) described lesions of the mouth consistent with Crohn's disease, and Croft and Wilkinson[10](#core-r010) reported ulceration of the mouth, pharynx and larynx in a patient with this disease. In a review of 332 cases of Crohn's disease they found 20 patients (6.1 per cent) with oral ulcers in some stage of the disease. The gross manifestations in the patient with laryngeal involvement consisted of diffuse edema of the mucosa of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx with involvement of the epiglottis, arytenoids and false cord but normal true cords. Examination of several biopsy specimens demonstrated edema with lymphocytic and plasma-cell infiltrates, but granulomas were not identified. Immunofluorescence studies showed absence of IgA, and they concluded that this patient's disorder was a variant of Crohn's disease affecting the mouth and larynx. Basu et al.[11](#core-r011) reviewed the oral manifestations of Crohn's disease by studying 100 patients with that disorder, 100 patients with ulcerative colitis and 100 control subjects. After excluding aphthous lesions they found oral lesions in nine patients with Crohn's disease, two of those with ulcerative colitis and one of the control subjects. Biopsies of the palate and epiglottis after steroid therapy demonstrated edema, chronic inflammation and focal formation of giant cells containing only a few nuclei. No definite granulomas were identified, however.Dr. Scully: Marked dilatation of lymphatics is a characteristic finding in specimens of Crohn's disease of the ileum, and its presence in the biopsy specimens lends support to that diagnosis.Dr. Goodman: Dr. Montgomery has seen a patient with a similar clinical problem.Dr. William W. Montgomery: I have seen one patient with a similar problem, a 25-year-old male school teacher who gave a two-month history of sore throat, dysphagia, a change in his voice and increasing dyspnea on exertion. On occasion there was radiation of the throat pain to both ears. A systemic review was negative. The epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds and arytenoids were pale-yellow and edematous. Abduction of the cords was limited, accounting for the dyspnea. The patient had been treated for an intestinal disorder, at first with steroids and then an operation when a fistula developed between the bladder and intestine three years previously. The fistula was repaired, the symptoms resolved, and the steroids were discontinued. The diagnosis at that time was Crohn's disease, possibly with laryngeal involvement. There was little or no response to 30 mg of prednisone daily. Dr. James C. Melby advised the administration of 60 mg of methyl prednisolone daily, which resulted in an excellent response in one week. The patient has been maintained on 20 mg of prednisone four times a day. A biopsy would have been of great interest but might have precipitated the need for a tracheotomy. A diagnosis of cricoarytenoid arthritis associated with Crohn's disease was also made. Several attempts to eliminate the steroids have resulted in a return of symptoms. He has had no further intestinal symptoms except for occasional diarrhea. An examination 3 1/2 years after I saw him initially revealed only mild thickening in the region of the arytenoids.Dr. Scully: Dr. Mulvaney, will you give us a follow-up report on this patient?Dr. Mulvaney: When seen eight months after the biopsy she still had patchy edema of the left soft palate and right arytenoid. She had had a tracheotomy but kept it plugged most of the time. About 10 months after the final biopsy she had some pain in the laryngeal area with increasing dysphagia, odynophagia and narrowing of the airway. This problem resolved spontaneously within a few weeks. High-dose prednisone, every four hours, was subsequently given for three weeks by Dr. Sheldon Wolfe, of the New England Medical Center Hospital, who has a special interest in granulomatous diseases, but there was no improvement in the clinical status of the patient.\n",

      "question": "A 30-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of multiple trauma.\nHe was apparently well until the evening of admission, when he was involved in a motorcycle accident. He was taken to another hospital, where physical examination showed that the pulse was 84 and the blood pressure was 60/30 mm Hg. The patient was alert and oriented. Multiple fractures were noted. The abdomen was distended and tender. An x-ray film of the chest showed widening of the mediastinum. Nasal oxygen was administered, and a nasogastric tube and an indwelling bladder catheter were inserted. Fluids were administered intravenously, followed by a transfusion of 2 units of whole blood. A nasotracheal tube was passed, and military antishock pressure trousers were applied. The blood pressure rose to 95/50 mm Hg, and the patient was transferred to this hospital. During his transportation via ambulance the blood pressure fell to 40 mm Hg systolic, although he remained alert.\nOn arrival in the Emergency Ward of this hospital the patient was alert and responsive. The systolic blood pressure was 50 mm Hg. He moved both upper extremities. The pupils were equal and reactive, and no evidence of head injury was observed. The lungs and heart were normal. The abdomen was distended and diffusely tender; bowel sounds were absent; no organs or masses were felt. There was evidence of fractures of both tibias and of the left femur.\nThe hematocrit was 33.4 per cent, and the platelet count 19,000. Another x-ray film of the chest (\nFig. 1\n) revealed that an endotracheal tube ended 1 cm above the thoracic inlet and a nasogastric tube terminated within the stomach; a screw was projected over the left upper portion of the abdomen at the base of the lung; a right subclavian line was sharply kinked and crossed to the left brachiocephalic vein; the superior mediastinum was widened, and the aortic knob was indistinct; the lungs and heart appeared normal.\nA left subclavian line was inserted, fluids were given intravenously, and two transfusions of group O, Rh-negative packed red cells were administered. Tetanus toxoid was injected intramuscularly, and an anti-G suit was applied. No urinary output was observed. The blood pressure rose to 100 mm Hg systolic. The patient was taken to the operating room, the anti-G suit was deflated, and an exploratory laparotomy was performed 30 minutes after his arrival. The peritoneum was entered, and 2 liters of fresh blood and clots were evacuated. The liver and spleen appeared intact, and no rapid reaccumulation of blood was evident. Examination of the small bowel showed a rent in the mesentery of the distal ileum. Several arteries that were bleeding actively in that region were clamped and ligated, and the contiguous portion of the ileum, which appeared nonviable, was resected. A small perforation of the proximal ileum was repaired. Scattered subserosal hematomas were seen in the remainder of the small bowel. A tear of the colonic serosa was closed. A hematoma in the right side of the pelvis, from which small amounts of blood oozed through a tear in the overlying peritoneum, appeared stable during a period of observation of 90 minutes. The abdominal incision was closed. During the operation the blood pressure ranged from 90 to 110 mm Hg systolic, and the patient received 12 units of packed red cells, 5 units of 5 per cent albumin, 4 units of fresh-frozen plasma, 10 liters of Ringer's lactate solution, and 5 units of platelet concentrate. Secretion of urine in an adequate volume resumed.\nImmediately after the laparotomy a diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Lenworth M. Jacobs\\*: The management of the exsanguinating patient with multiple injuries is always a clinical challenge. Not only is the correct diagnosis important, but the categorization of injuries based on their severity and the temporal sequence of surgical intervention is essential to a favorable outcome. This case demonstrates the dilemma facing the trauma surgeon who must evaluate a patient in profound shock. This patient's shock, evidenced by persistent hypotension and anuria, did not respond to resuscitative efforts at the initial receiving hospital or en route to the trauma center. A thorough history and complete physical examination as well as diagnostic tests should be performed in a rapid and comprehensive manner. However, these investigations should not waste valuable time in quest of specific diagnoses, since this type of critically ill patient often requires simultaneous assessment, evaluation, and intervention. The patient must be volume-resuscitated rapidly to correct both hypotension and acidosis and then taken to the operating room for control of hemorrhage and definitive therapy.This patient presented with injuries to the chest, abdomen, and bony skeleton and had a concomitant renal insult and coagulopathy. The possibility ofother, less obvious injuries \u2014 for example, spinal-cord damage \u2014 had to be investigated. To establish priorities of care and to determine which problems should be addressed and in which order, I shall review the clinical scenario outlined in this case record.It is reasonable to start the discussion of this case by reviewing the results of the initial examination. The patient was alert and oriented but was hypotensive, with a blood pressure of 60/30 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 84 per minute. A logical plan for assessment is to evaluate the status of the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. Little mention is made of this patient's respiratory status, but he was intubated with a nasotracheal tube. It is not clear why it was required. However, if the cervical spine was immobilized, indicating a question of a cervical injury, insertion of a nasotracheal tube is the appropriate way to manage the airway.[1\u20133](#core-r001) The tube can be passed without hyperextension of the neck, thus avoiding manipulation of the cervical spine and iatrogenic spinal-cord injury.[4](#core-r004) The passage of the tube may be difficult technically, but it does avoid an operative procedure. Nasotracheal intubation can be performed swiftly by skilled persons experienced in this technique. An alternative method of airway control, recommended by the American College of Surgeons in their Advanced Life Support Course, is a cricothyroidotomy.[4,5](#core-r004)The circulatory status can be evaluated initially by frequent recordings of the blood pressure and pulse as well as by observation for signs of internal and external bleeding. Knowledge of the patient's normal range is of great assistance in estimating the degree of change. This patient was hypotensive and had a relatively normal pulse rate. During the initial stages of shock due to hemorrhage the body's responses include a decrease in arterial pressure and an increase in the stroke volume and heart rate. Since neural and adrenal activity contributes to vasoconstriction there is a resultant preferential perfusion of the heart and the brain.[6](#core-r006) This patient apparently had adequate cerebral perfusion since he was alert and oriented. However, that may be a misleading assessment, since a number of his injuries were capable of causing considerable blood loss. These injuries included the fractured tibias and the fractured femur, along with those that resulted in abdominal distention and mediastinal widening. Fracture of a femur can cause a loss of 1000 ml of blood, and fracture of a tibia can cause a loss of 500 ml. Also, since this patient's abdomen was distended with blood an additional blood loss of 1000 to 1500 ml should have been suspected. There is no mention of a hemothorax, but a widened mediastinum is an ominous sign of injury to a major vessel \u2014 specifically, a transected aorta.[7\u201312](#core-r007) Thus, on the basis of all these injuries it is possible to estimate that there was a blood loss of between 3000 and 5000 ml. It would have been important to obtain the blood pressure in the right arm and the left arm and also to correlate the amplitude of the pulses in the carotid versus the femoral vessels. A pulse or blood-pressure difference would have raised the suspicion of a transected aorta.[8](#core-r008)The use of the military antishock trousers was clearly indicated in this hypotensive patient. This device is a pneumatic three-piece garment that is an exsanguinating tourniquet. Each leg and then the abdominal section are inflated, thus transfusing 1000 ml of blood cephalad.[13](#core-r013) The suit is designed to allow access to the genitalia so that the urinary tract can be assessed. An added advantage to using this suit is that it serves as a compression dressing and a splint for lower-extremity fractures. The abdominal section also tamponades an expanding hemoperitoneum.[14,15](#core-r014) The suit has a pop-off valve, which prevents overinflation and maintains an exsanguinating pressure of 100 to 110 mm Hg.As the assessment continues, it is important that care be taken with manipulation of the cervical spine. An injury at that site should be assumed until excluded by an x-ray film showing seven normal cervical vertebras.[16,17](#core-r016) If this patient did have a spinal-cord injury it could have contributed to the hypotension on the basis of loss of vasoconstrictor tone. A spinal-cord injury can be excluded easily on the basis of a physical examination that includes testing of muscle power and tone and reflexes and a rectal examination with testing for the so-called anal wink.[3,18](#core-r003)On arrival at this hospital the physical examination revealed that both upper extremities moved, but there is no comment about sensation, reflexes, or muscle tone in the lower extremities. A neurologic deficit in the abdomen and lower extremities is also a clinical guide to rupture of the aorta. The deficit may be due to direct fracture of the thoracic vertebras with transection of the cord and laceration of the aorta by the bony fragments, or it may be secondary to spinal-cord anoxia after transection of the aorta and compromise of the spinal arteries that arise from it distal to the transection.[8,19\u201321](#core-r008)After the initial evaluation of the airway, breathing, and circulation a thorough examination of the abdomen and chest should be performed. This patient had an expanding hemoperitoneum, indicating injury to the abdomen. The x-ray films of the chest confirmed the presence of a widened mediastinum and demonstrated an indistinct aortic knob suggestive of a ruptured aorta.[10,22](#core-r010) On the basis of these two findings surgical intervention may be indicated. However, this patient with a systolic blood pressure of 50 mm Hg required aggressive volume resuscitation, including the transfusion of red cells, clotting factors, and platelets, before being taken to the operating room. There was insufficient time to wait for typing and cross-matching of blood, and thus the transfusion of group O, Rh-negative blood or packed cells and fresh-frozen plasma was the treatment of choice. The early use of platelets was appropriate in this case, since a thrombocytopenic coagulopathy needs to be corrected before and during an operation.This patient had obvious injury in the abdomen as well as the possibility of transection of the aorta and exsanguination into the left side of the chest. Both of these injuries are life-threatening. However, the expanding hemoperitoneum was an obvious indicator of current abdominal bleeding. The absence of a hemothorax and the presence of a widened mediastinum raise the possibility that an aortic injury had tamponaded and had not yet ruptured into the left side of the chest.An exploratory laparotomy under these circumstances will reveal any ruptured viscus or solid organ and allow for control of the bleeding. There is the possibility of rupture of the thoracic aorta during the abdominal exploration. It would be useful to have a preoperative aortographic study to confirm the diagnosis and localize the site of the transection.[22](#core-r022) That procedure would also aid in positioning of the patient, either in the left lateral position for a thoracotomy if the transection is just distal to the exit of the left subclavian artery or in the supine position for a medial sternotomy if the transection is at the root of the aorta.[8](#core-r008) This patient had cardiovascular instability, and attempts at resuscitation failed despite aggressive volume replacement. Therefore, it would not have been good judgment to obtain an aortographic examination, which could have delayed therapy from 30 to 60 minutes. It was also unnecessary to perform peritoneal lavage.[23](#core-r023) However, if the signs had been more subtle and if the patient had been resuscitated and was stable from a cardiovascular viewpoint peritoneal lavage would have been useful to determine if there was an abdominal injury requiring immediate therapy[24](#core-r024) or if there was time to proceed to an angiographic study.Peritoneal lavage is easily performed by placing a peritoneal dialysis catheter under direct vision into the abdominal cavity through an infraumbilical incision with a local anesthetic.[25](#core-r025) The peritoneum is directly visualized and opened, thus avoiding iatrogenic injury. One liter of saline solution is introduced into the peritoneal cavity and then siphoned out of it.The presence of grossly evident blood in the effluent would indicate urgency in performing an exploratory laparotomy and would make the abdomen the operative priority. This method was described by Root et al.[26](#core-r026) and Thal and Shires.[27](#core-r027) The investigation is simple and 98 per cent accurate for the assessment of intraperitoneal injury.[25,28](#core-r025) The test is grossly positive if blood is aspirated from the peritoneal cavity. It is positive if the red-cell count is greater than 100,000 per cubic millimeter, if the white-cell count is greater than 500 per cubic millimeter, or if there is an elevated amylase, bile, or bacteria content in the fluid. It is equivocal if there are 20,000 to 100,000 red cells per cubic millimeter and negative if there are less than 20,000 red cells per cubic millimeter.[28,29](#core-r028) The contraindications for this test are multiple previous abdominal operations, a gravid uterus, or the presence of dilated bowel. The patient also needs to have an empty bladder, as was true in this patient, to prevent iatrogenic bladder injury.[27](#core-r027)In the management of this patient the hemodynamic instability mandated an immediate laparotomy. The finding of 2 liters of blood at laparotomy is difficult to explain on the basis of mesenteric arterial bleeding alone. There is no mention of a superior retroperitoneal hematoma or of a duodenal or pancreatic injury. If a hematoma is present in this location it is imperative to explore the superior retroperitoneum, control any hemorrhage, and evaluate the organs in this area completely.[30](#core-r030) However, a pelvic hematoma should not be explored if the bleeding is contained and the hematoma is not expanding rapidly or pulsating. Exploration of a pelvic hematoma would release the tamponading effect, and pelvic bleeding is extremely difficult to control.[31,32](#core-r031)It is important to be certain that the urinary system is not injured. An additional measure to evaluate the lower urinary tract is a rectal examination with palpation of the prostate gland. If it is displaced and there is bogginess in the area the findings are highly suggestive of a damaged urethra. If hematuria is found and there is time preoperatively a retrograde urethrographic study followed by a filling and voiding cystographic study and an intravenous urographic study are indicated.[33](#core-r033) In this situation, with anuria and exsanguination, the bladder is a secondary consideration. Once the bleeding has been controlled during the exploratory laparotomy the kidneys can be palpated, the ureters inspected, and the bladder distended in a retrograde fashion to check for extravasation. On-table intravenous urograms can be obtained if there is a question of loss of renal function. The option to perform a thoracoabdominal procedure should be retained since it allows a simultaneous approach to both the chest and the abdomen. The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is a ruptured abdominal viscus, especially the colon, there can be cross-contamination with feces from the abdominal cavity to a prosthetic aortic replacement graft.[34](#core-r034)The anteroposterior radiograph demonstrated a widened mediastinum and blurring of the aortic knob. The other radiologic findings worthy of comment are the demonstration that the central-venous-pressure line was coiled in the innominate vein and that a screw was apparently present in the left upper quadrant. It is not unusual for a central-venous-pressure line to be misplaced,[35,36](#core-r035) but in this case it raises the question of an innominate-vein hematoma as the cause of the widened mediastinum. That possibility should have been pursued only after a transected aorta had been excluded. The screw did not appear to be in the stomach, since the tip projected above the diaphragm. It is improbable that it had been aspirated, as it would have lodged in the bronchus and been evident more centrally in the lung fields. There was no free air under the diaphragm or hemopneumothorax, and therefore the possibility of traumatic perforation of the stomach and diaphragm was remote.[37](#core-r037) However, during the exploratory laparotomy the diaphragm should have been inspected carefully for injury. The screw could have penetrated the skin as an extraneous missile and could have been in the superficial soft tissues. That possibility could have been verified with a lateral x-ray film and close inspection of the skin for a puncture wound.The most serious finding was the widened mediastinum, which is indicative of an aortic injury. This patient did not exhibit the common symptoms of aortic transection \u2014 namely, retrosternal or interscapular pain, which is thought to be due to hemorrhagic dissection of the mediastinal structures.[8,21,22](#core-r008) He did not complain of dysphagia or dyspnea, which are secondary to compression of the esophagus or trachea, respectively.[8](#core-r008) There is no mention of any of the common signs of aortic transection on physical examination. These include chest-wall contusion, fractures of the ribs, especially of the first or second rib, a systolic turbulence within the aorta,[21,38](#core-r021) and hemothorax. The typical difference in pulse amplitude between the upper and lower extremities due to creation of an intraaortic intimal obstruction at the site of transection was not mentioned. Paraplegia secondary to anoxia of the cord was not present. However, absence of all these findings does not exclude transection of the aorta. Secondary radiographic signs of a transected aorta, although not found in this patient, are depression of the left main-stem bronchus, deviation of a nasogastric tube to the right, an apical pleural cap with obliteration of the apex of the left upper lobe, hemothorax, and multiple fractures of the ribs, especially of the first and second ribs.[10](#core-r010) The absence of these radiographic signs should not eliminate the suspicion of transection of the aorta because they are not observed in 28 per cent of the cases.[39](#core-r039)The patient was the victim of a type of injury that may result in aortic transection. The mechanism involved is sudden deceleration, such as occurs during a motor-vehicle accident. The site of rupture in 80 to 90 per cent of the cases[8](#core-r008) is just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery,[40](#core-r040) where the aorta is tethered by the ligamentum arteriosum, and the deceleration causes shearing forces to transect the aorta at this site. In 10 to 20 per cent of the cases the site of rupture is just distal to the aortic valve. In such cases the heart is displaced into the left posterior portion of the chest by compression of the sternum during rapid deceleration, causing shearing stress at the root of the aorta.[22](#core-r022) Another mechanism, called the \"water-hammer effect,\"[21](#core-r021) is described as an increase in the intraaortic pressure, with proximal rupture at the same location. This type of rupture is usually immediately fatal because of hemopericardium, pericardial tamponade, and exsanguination. Still another, very rare mechanism of rupture is laceration of the descending aorta by bony fragments of the vertebral column.[8](#core-r008)Traumatic rupture of the aorta is found in 10 to 15 per cent of patients injured in automobile accidents with rapid deceleration.[41](#core-r041) Eighty to 90 per cent of them die by exsanguination within minutes of the injury, and 10 to 20 per cent survive long enough to present in an emergency department.[40](#core-r040) The proportion of the patients who survive to reach a hospital is increasing with the advent of modern emergency medical systems and rapid transportation by modern ambulances and helicopters. The challenge is to make the diagnosis early in the course since a delay can lead to rupture and death. In the patients who survive for at least five minutes rupture of the aorta is temporarily tamponaded by its paper-thin adventitia, the pleura, and the adjacent mediastinal structures. Fifteen per cent of these patients survive for at least one hour.[8](#core-r008) Thirty per cent exsanguinate freely within six hours, 49 per cent within 24 hours, 72 per cent within eight days, and 90 per cent within four months.[40](#core-r040)Modern technology will be assisting in the diagnosis of aortic transection in the future. The definitive diagnostic procedure has been an aortographic examination. However, it is invasive and requires a skilled arteriographer. A promising noninvasive procedure is digital subtraction, by which arteries are visualized after the intravenous injection of contrast material. Erikson et al.[42](#core-r042) described the use of digital fluoroscopic procedures that permit intravenous arteriographic examination under these circumstances. This approach is rapidly improving, with excellent resolution, and should soon have a place in the armamentarium for the diagnosis of a transected aorta.In summary, this patient had known injuries to both tibias, the left femur, the small bowel, the large bowel, and the pelvis, and I suspect that he had a transected aorta as well.Dr. Robert A. Novelline: The x-ray film of the chest obtained on admission ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows widening of the upper mediastinum, and the area of the aortic arch is indistinct. Both findings are disturbing signs after trauma. The cardiac silhouette, the diaphragm, and the lungs are normal. The right subclavian line crosses the mediastinum, terminating in the left innominate vein. Overlying the chest are cardiac pacing wires. The nasogastric tube is not displaced to the right. The metallic screw that was mentioned seems to be associated with overlying ventilator tubing.Dr. Eugene J. Mark: Dr. Atnip, you saw this patient in the Emergency Ward and performed the exploratory laparotomy. What were your diagnoses?Dr. Robert G. Atnip: When we first saw this man we thought that he was exsanguinating from an intraabdominal injury. He had marked abdominal distention and tenderness, with absent bowel sounds \u2014 the typical picture of hemoperitoneum. Although the mediastinum was widened, the x-ray film obtained at this hospital did not show greater widening than the initial film taken at the other hospital, and there was no evidence of a left hemothorax. We thought that the site of ongoing blood loss was in the abdomen, and that it had to be dealt with quickly before further evaluation of the aorta could be carried out. The initial examination of the lower extremities was incomplete because of the military antishock trousers. His feet were free, and he was able to move all his toes and had some sensation in both feet. So we were reassured that if there was a spinal-cord injury at least it was not complete.After we entered the abdomen and evacuated the blood it did not reaccumulate rapidly. The liver and spleen were intact. Examination of the upper portion of the retroperitoneum, both through the lesser sac and inferior to the transverse mesocolon, revealed no accumulation of blood, bile, or other fluids in that area. We believed that the only site of active blood loss was the ileal mesentery, where there was fairly rapid bleeding from several small vessels. There was a large but stable pelvic retroperitoneal hematoma, which must have contributed considerably to the total blood loss.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Mark: The diagnostic procedure was a thoracic aortographic study. Dr. Novelline will describe the results.Dr. Novelline: The findings are typical of traumatic rupture of the aorta, with a false aneurysm just beyond the take-off of the subclavian artery ([Fig. 2](#f002)). There is evidence of increased mediastinal widening between the time of the initial film of the chest and the arteriograms. Another sign of traumatic rupture of the aorta seen on the arteriograms is the apical pleural cap caused by extension of a hematoma from the mediastinum up over the apex of the lung and outside the parietal pleura. Still another sign present on the later films is deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right.Dr. Willard M. Daggett: We then performed a left thoracotomy and found a hematoma surrounding the upper and middle portions of the descending thoracic aorta. This hematoma was tamponaded by the mediastinal pleura, and there was no free bleeding into the left pleural space. A heparinized Gott shunt was placed from the ascending aorta to the left femoral artery to be used as a bypass during resection of the disrupted aorta. After mobilization the aorta was clamped proximally between the origins of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, and a distal clamp was placed at the level of the hilus. The aorta was then opened, and we found one tear just at the origin of the left subclavian artery and a second tear just above the level of the left hilus. Therefore, the entire segment of the aorta between the origin of the left subclavian artery and the level of the left hilus was resected to remove both tears. Aortic continuity was restored by inserting a Dacron graft with end-to-end anastomoses.Dr. Thomas H. Aretz: We received two fragments of aortic tissue, one of which contained a transverse intimal tear, 0.7 cm in length, that extended 2 mm in depth. Microscopical examination showed the intimal rent extending into the media with fresh adventitial hemorrhage and older blood clot. A segment of small bowel, 64 cm in length, which had been removed at the earlier operation, contained large, fresh mesenteric and submucosal hemorrhages.This case illustrates the types of injury of modern travel associated with sudden deceleration and blunt chest trauma. A five-year study of 389 lethal cases of blunt chest trauma at the Cologne Forensic Institute showed that over 40 per cent of the patients had rupture of the aorta, and in over half of these cases it was judged to be the cause of death.[43](#core-r043)Rupture of the aorta was described as early as 1893 by Rindfleisch,[44](#core-r044) who suggested sudden stretch as the mechanism. Oppenheim,[45](#core-r045) in 1918, ligated the branches and ends of human post-mortem aortic specimens and filled them with water, using the Munich public water supply, the pressure of which was approximately 4 atm (about 3000 mm Hg). He observed the sites of rupture and measured the pressures at which the specimens burst. The most common site was the ascending aorta, which could withstand a pressure up to 3000 mm Hg. Since the ascending aorta has the largest diameter its wall tension is greatest. Jores[46](#core-r046) devoted four pages to traumatic rupture of the aorta in the 1924 edition of the textbook of pathology by Henke and Lubarsch. The injury had become well known at that time because of the many airplane crashes during World War I. Torsion and compression of internal organs as well as sudden deceleration were believed to be the mechanisms of rupture. Lundevall[47](#core-r047) reviewed the literature and added experimental data in 1964. Although the wall tension is highest in the ascending aorta, the most common site of rupture in vivo is the aortic isthmus, just distal to the take-off of the left subclavian artery. Several factors lead to rupture at that level. During extreme dorsiflexion of the head, such as in an automobile accident, the aortic arch is tethered by the neck vessels, which keep it stationary in relation to the remaining thoracic organs. In addition, there may be torsion of the aorta. Lundevall determined that the tensile strength of the isthmic portion of the aorta was less than that of the ascending portion. Taking into account all these factors and using calculations based on the geometry and the blood content of the aorta, he concluded that the concave portion of the isthmus ruptures at the lowest *g* (acceleration and deceleration) forces. Incidentally, this patient had prolonged hypertension postoperatively, requiring medication. This complication is fairly common and has also been observed in patients after resection of coarctation of the aorta.[48](#core-r048) A sympathetic reflex caused by stretching the aortic wall in the area of the isthmus seems to be the mechanism.Dr. Mark: Dr. Jupiter, you managed the patient's orthopedic problems shortly after the cardiovascular operation. Will you comment?Dr. Jesse B. Jupiter: We attempted to stabilize all the skeletal injuries as soon as possible and cooperated very closely with the general surgeons and anesthesiologists.This patient had major skeletal injuries. The pelvic fracture was of the Malgaigne type, which is very unstable and is by itself associated with considerable blood loss. We applied rigid external stabilization, using a Hoffman type of external fixateur, immediately in the operating room after the completion of the described operations. This procedure not only helps to stabilize the pelvis, adding to relief of pain and the ease of nursing care, but also closes up the pelvic vault, markedly reducing the venous bleeding in the pelvis. It proved to be very efficacious in this case. The external fixateur was removed after eight weeks. The patient's pelvis has remained stable with an almost anatomical reduction, and he has no residual pain in that area. On the left side both the femur and the tibia were fractured, producing what has been called a \"floating knee.\" This type of injury has proved to be a very difficult problem from the viewpoint of both management and long-term functional results. We were able to stabilize the open tibial fracture, again with a Hoffman external fixateur, and to stabilize the femoral fracture with an intermedullary Hansen\u2013Street nail, providing both immediate stability and a very good functional result. On the right side there was a comminuted intraarticular fracture of the tibial plateau, which was open. It was treated by debridement and placement of a skeletal-traction device through the tibia, and then it was placed in skeletal traction. Because of the comminution we were unable to immobilize these fracture fragments rigidly but started the patient on early motion, and now he is in a cast brace and ambulating on this side.It is now almost 8 1/2 weeks since the injury, and the patient is ambulating with parallel bars, with an excellent range of motion of the left knee.Dr. Jacobs: Although I mentioned in my discussion some of the newer diagnostic methods that are undergoing investigation by radiologists, I should like to affirm that the definitive investigation for aortic rupture is an aortographic examination. I did not comment on the prehospital management in this case. With modern communication now operational between the scene of the accident and the hospital the hospital staff usually has one to 30 minutes of advance notification that a patient is being transported to its facility and in what condition. The physicians and nurses staffing the emergency department, by paying attention to the history and reported findings on physical examination, can have an idea of the patient's problems, alert certain areas of the hospital (e.g., the blood bank, the arteriography suite, and the operating room), and assemble the whole trauma team before the patient arrives. This case demonstrates very well the clinical manifestations of multiple injuries and the appropriate approach to their management.\n",

      "question": "A thirty-eight-year-old married office worker entered the hospital with a complaint of swelling of the right leg.\nFor the past several years she had experienced mild swelling of both ankles at the end of the day, more marked after being on her feet for long hours. Ten months prior to admission she began to experience cramps in her right foot at night, apparently waking her and subsiding in five or ten minutes. No change in appearance of the extremity was noted at this time, but later the cramps recurred higher in the leg, the leg became red, and a red \"line\" appeared on the inner aspect of the thigh. Several months following this episode she was seen in a physician's office. At that time swelling of the right leg was as high as the groin. Pelvic examination revealed a firm, fixed, irregular mass, high on the right in the region of the uterosacral ligament. About five months later, after visiting at least one hospital, where a diagnosis of \"idiopathic lymphedema\" was made, she returned to her physician. At this time she was receiving codeine because of the pain. She stated that the swelling decreased when she stayed in bed, and that during her last two menstrual periods the pain and swelling were aggravated. Rectal examination revealed an increase in size of the fixed pelvic mass.\nThe menstrual history was negative, her periods occurring every twenty-six to twenty-eight days, lasting four days and without pain. She had a history of four miscarriages at two to four months during the past eight years.\nAt the age of eighteen, six months following an appendectomy, a \"tumor of the abdominal wall\" was excised. At that time she was told by the surgeon that she would probably be unable to have children.\nPhysical examination revealed a well developed and well nourished woman. In the midthigh the right leg measured 54 cm., and the left 45 cm.; at the calf the right was 42 cm., and the left 34 cm. The right ankle measured 28 cm., and the left 24.8 cm. On pelvic examination a hard, tender mass was felt high in the pelvis. The rest of the examination was negative.\nThe blood pressure was 130 systolic, 80 diastolic.\nExamination of the blood and urine was negative. A prothrombin time was 22 seconds (normal, 18 seconds). An x-ray film of the chest was normal.\nOn the day following admission an operation was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Irad B. Hardy\\*: We have here the problem of moderately advanced unilateral lymphedema coming on rather rapidly in a young woman. Of course, we must decide what the pelvic mass was and whether it had any causal relation to the swelling. In the first place, I think we can very quickly rule out the systemic causes of swelling of the legs simply on the basis that this was a unilateral affair, and such conditions as nutritional edema, renal disease, heart disease and hyperthyroidism can be discarded. Also, among the mechanical causes of edema any lesion above the bifurcation of the iliacs can be ruled out because this was a unilateral process.I suspect all we have in the way of x-ray studies is a chest film. May we see it?Dr. Stanley Wyman: I do not believe there is anything to add to the record, Dr. Hardy. It appears to be within normal limits.Dr. Hardy: No intravenous pyelogram?Dr. Wyman: No.Dr. Hardy: To review the protocol, there are some things we might point out briefly. For several years this woman had mild swelling in both ankles by the end of the day. I do not believe that is verysignificant; it is a very common complaint. I doubt if it had much bearing on this particular case.Ten months before being seen in the hospital she began to have some cramps in her leg and later in her thigh, and finally she noted that the leg was red and that a red line had appeared on the inner aspect of the thigh. There was no mention of any special degree of swelling, and I presume there was none. This may have represented an initial episode of mild cellulitis; possibly the red streak was lymphangitis or superficial thrombophlebitis. At any rate, this redness and streaking were not mentioned again, and I think we can assume, if it was an initial episode of cellulitis and infection, that at least it was not repeated over the following months. Several months later (we do not know how much later or how soon before she came in) she had swelling in the groin, and we again have to assume that the swelling had become progressive. She also had an irregular, firm, fixed pelvic mass.She was then lost track of and upon returning to her physician, which was just about the time she entered the hospital, she had been taking codeine for the relief of pain, which had apparently developed somewhere along the line. I think that, although swollen legs are certainly uncomfortable, the necessity for codeine is not very common. The usual therapy to relieve the pain associated with simple lymphedema is aspirin, an elastic support or elevation. I suspect that this necessity for codeine may indicate that there was some process going on that was involving the nerves as well as the lymphatic drainage.We then find that the menstrual cycle was essentially normal but that she had had over a period of eight years several miscarriages in the early months. I wonder whether that means a mechanical obstruction in the pelvis, which prevented full-term pregnancies. However, I am of the opinion that that was not the case and that there was probably a hormonal imbalance that prevented her from going on to full term. Later, the mass in the pelvis was apparently of fairly rapid development and probably did not account for the fact that she had not been able to have full-term pregnancies for as far back as eight years previously.On admission to the hospital the physical examination, such as we have to go on, shows that she had a moderately diffuse swelling located in the right groin. There is no mention of any marked venous stasis, and no mention of a great deal of induration, pigmentation or dilated veins to suggest a postphlebitic state. There is no mention of any redness or cellulitis, which we would have expected to be present if she had had an inflammatory process going on all this time. Since it is not mentioned, I shall assume that it had not been present. No palpable lymph nodes are recorded.In deciding just what type of lymphedema we are dealing with I will run through very briefly one of the better classifications of lymphedema that might be able to help us. I have picked Dr. E. V. Allen's[1](#core-r002) classification, because I think it is the best and easiest to fit into this picture. He divides unilateral lymphedema into noninflammatory and inflammatory groups. Under the noninflammatory group we have the primary and secondary cases. In the primary cases, we have what he calls lymphedema Precox \u2014 lymphedema of unknown etiology that comes on in adolescence, usually in females. There is no known obstruction. The lymph vessels are just not capable of handling things, and a gradual process of fibrosis and further obstruction and swelling develops. There is usually no story of cellulitis or recurrent sepsis to account for it. In addition to the Precox type, there is a congenital type of primary lymphedema. But we can rule that out because this occurred in her thirty-eighth year and there was no previous sign, except a little bit of swelling, which I do not believe was true lymphedema.Under the secondary type of noninflammatory lymphedema, we have occlusion of the lymph system by malignant growth such as metastatic involvement of lymph nodes, or following eradication of the lymph nodes, such as we frequently see after a radical axillary or groin dissection. The cases that follow x-ray or radium treatments are also in this group.The second division is the inflammatory group of lymphedema, and here also there are infections in the leg brought on for no apparent cause, there being no obvious focus of entry. The episodes are initiated by chills and fever and other symptoms that we have not seen in this case, and therefore I assume that it does not fit into that group.In the secondary type of inflammatory lymphedema are the cases associated with venous stasis due to old phlebitis and those in which there is marked venous insufficiency and obvious routes of entry for secondary sepsis. The fungous infections and filariasis are considered to be of this group. Also, there are the cases of lymphedema following severe local injury and trauma.In reviewing all the groups under the classification, I believe this woman of thirty-eight with rapidly increasing swelling in whom there was no evidence of recurrent chills or fever, no significant findings to suggest venous disease or fungous infection and no local injury, probably fits into the secondary group of noninflammatory cases. There may have been occlusion of the lymph channels and lymph nodes in the pelvis and iliac region that was due probably to some type of malignant tumor. We cannot rule out inflammatory disease itself, but I would think if a lesion of this sort were purely inflammatory and widespread enough to cause that amount of swelling there would have been more reaction such as chills and fever.From the beginning, it has been my impression that this mass was some kind of retroperitoneal condition rather than a pelvic lesion. The examiners were apparently able to outline a normal ovary, a normal uterus and this mass. The retroperitoneal location does not eliminate an ovarian tumor because the ovary may have been in ectopic position or may have become adherent so that the tumor would invade in that direction and plug the lymphatics; it is very far-fetched reasoning. I wonder why the doctor at the time of her second operation, when she was eighteen years old, told her that she would have no children after he had operated on the tumor of the abdominal wall. It is just possible that she had an ovary in the inguinal canal.Another condition that I have to mention, in spite of the negative abdominal examination, the absence of lymph nodes and the normal chest film, is a localized lymphosarcoma involving the pelvic iliac nodes and causing obstruction to the lymph outflow. Although there were several years between, she had had a considerable amount of surgery, some of it rather extensive, and she could have had interference with lymph structures from postoperative scar formation. This may not have manifested itself for several years. Another possibility is some type of local tumor of the lymph vessels such as lymphangioma. However, I think I will have to say that she probably had a lymphosarcoma of the iliac lymph nodes with obstruction to account for the lymphedema.Dr. Tracy B. Mallory: Are there any questions or suggestions? Dr. Ulfelder, do you want to tell us the opinion on the wards?Dr. Howard Ulfelder: The protocol could not make it as obvious as it was to us who saw the patient that this pelvic mass was very suggestive of endometriosis. It lay in the posterior cul-de-sac as far as we could tell and could be easily palpated both by pelvic and by rectal examination, and on combined examination it seemed to lie against the posterior aspect of the cervix and anterior to the rectum. It was my impression on the basis of this examination that this mass was more likely to be endometriosis in the region of the uterosacral ligaments than anything else.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Ulfelder: Dr. Hardy was quite correct in classifying this as a case of noninflammatory, secondary, unilateral lymphedema because that is exactly what she had. She had occlusion of the right external iliac vein by a very firm and fibrous mass intimately connected with the lymph nodes in this area. The only unusual feature of the case, and in my experience it is unique, was the nature of the disease within and outside the lymph nodes, because this was also endometriosis. She had endometriosis of the lymph nodes in the operative area surrounding the external iliac vein. Endometriosis was also present outside the lymph nodes, and at the time of operation it was very easily demonstrable that this was the cause of the difficulty. The peritoneum was opened on this side, and dissection carried down along the vessels. The external iliac artery was adherent posteriorly to it but was not involved in the pathologic process. The ureter was not involved in the disease process. It could easily be separated from the peritoneum but the external iliac vein on the right side was completely surrounded by the diseased tissue and was in turn adherent to the pelvic wall. I was not able, of course, to dissect this out because it was too fixed a process, but I was able to free the vein from the pelvic wall and I obtained a biopsy of the fibrous tissue along the pelvic wall. I was also able to remove a number of lymph nodes in the immediate vicinity. The pelvic tumor was entirely separate. It was an endometrioma of the rectovaginal pouch in the usual position behind the cervical segment and with the bowel adherent to it.Dr. Alfred Kranes: Was not the absence of dysmenorrhea quite unusual?Dr. Ulfelder: Dysmenorrhea is classically the symptom of endometriosis, particularly increasing dysmenorrhea. On the other hand, in any analysis of series of cases in which this diagnosis has been made histologically, it is usually noted that about 40 to 50 per cent of patients have not had pelvic pain; it is not by any means a *sine qua non.*Dr. Mallory: I have a slide I would like to demonstrate. This is from one of the lymph nodes in the region of the iliac vein, and here one can quite clearly see a gland lined with columnar epithelium. Around it is hemorrhagic stroma of the endometrial type. This gland lies just at the margin of the node and is a very clear-cut focus of endometriosis within the node strongly suggestive of a metastasis. I believe metastasis does occur in this condition infrequently but not extremely rarely. There was recently reported from the Gynecological Clinic at Cornell a series of 5 cases showing metastases of endometriosis to lymph nodes and various places around the pelvis.[2](#core-r002)There was only one lead in the story as written, and that was the accentuation of symptoms at the time of the menstrual periods. That is a rather flimsy lead, I grant, because so many women have accentuation of every kind of symptom at that time.Dr. Kranes: Was she relieved of her edema?Dr. Ulfelder: It is not fair to judge so soon. She was operated on recently, and of course her rest in bed brought about a marked decrease in the edema.Dr. Mallory: In handling this case you thought that it was necessary to remove both ovaries?Dr. Ulfelder: Yes, I did, for two reasons. I could not tell grossly that this was endometriosis; although that was my impression, it has never been described as producing this picture. So from a diagnostic point of view, I thought I was dealing with a malignant lesion, with metastasis to that site, or with endometriosis, either one of which in this situation would have demanded removal of all the pelvic organs, including both ovaries.Dr. Mallory: One can be quite sure that after sterilization, it would not progress, but one cannot be sure how much the fibrosis will regress.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Katelyn M. Dorney\n(Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 30-year-old woman presented to the emergency department of this hospital with chills and sudden worsening of abdominal pain in both lower quadrants.\nThe patient was in her usual good health until 10 days before admission, when, after eating at a restaurant, she had nonbloody, nonbilious emesis that she attributed to food poisoning. The vomiting persisted for 2 days and then resolved. One day later, bilateral abdominal pain developed; the pain waxed and waned for a few days. She then completed a 2-day driving trip as part of her relocation to New England for a new job. During the trip, she had watery, nonbloody diarrhea every time she tried to eat (about four times per day). Her travel companion ate foods that were similar to the foods she ate but was well. After the patient arrived at her final destination, chills, fevers, and \u201csharp\u201d abdominal pain in both lower quadrants, with bloating, developed. She took naproxen every 8 hours for the pain and noted some improvement. She had minimal appetite, and she noted that the frequency of the diarrheal episodes decreased when her eating decreased. However, abdominal pain persisted and intensified until she rated it as 9 to 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Two nights later, she was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of abdominal pain and distention, diarrhea, and chills.\nOn arrival, the patient reported nausea and increased abdominal pain without further episodes of emesis. There was no hematochezia, melena, vaginal discharge, dysuria, or foul-smelling urine. Menarche had occurred at 12 years of age. Her menstrual periods occurred in normal 30-day cycles; her most recent menstrual period had been 2 weeks before this presentation. She had had no known contact with persons who were ill. She had no chest, flank, back, or neck pain, no dyspnea, and no swelling or pain in the calves. She had not lost weight.\nThe patient had a history of a 1-cm ovarian cyst, which had been identified during her early teenage years. She was of East Asian descent, had lived in the Midwest for the previous 10 years, and worked in a medical field. At presentation, she was taking no medications except naproxen, as well as ibuprofen for pain during menstruation. She had no known drug allergies. She did not smoke or use alcohol or illicit drugs. She had never been sexually active. Her father had diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. There was no family history of cancer.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 129 beats per minute, the blood pressure 123/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Her body was well developed. She appeared to be uncomfortable except when she was lying flat. She appeared to be flushed, but there was no scleral icterus or rash. She had tachycardia, but the cardiac examination was otherwise normal. The abdomen was mildly distended, with tenderness in both lower quadrants that was worst in the midline; there was voluntary guarding on palpation but no rebound, and bowel sounds were diminished. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nResults of coagulation tests were normal, as were red-cell indexes and blood levels of magnesium and globulin; other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Two sets of blood culture specimens and a urine culture specimen were obtained. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and patchy bibasilar opacities. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative.\nIntravenous normal saline, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and morphine were administered. Imaging studies were obtained and additional diagnostic procedures were performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Leigh H. Simmons:* This previously healthy 30-year-old woman presented with progressively worsening abdominal pain in both lower quadrants, chills, leukocytosis, and a markedly elevated level of CA-125. I will begin by discussing how I might have approached this patient\u2019s initial evaluation. At first glance, the key features of her presentation are the subacute nature of her illness, which included an initial period of vomiting, followed by a brief period of improvement, and then worsening abdominal pain, chills, and diarrhea. Notable elements of her history include her good health before this 10-day period of illness began, a history of no abdominal operations, her place of birth in East Asia, and her report of never having had sexual intercourse.The first days of the patient\u2019s illness, which were characterized by vomiting, are consistent with infectious gastroenteritis, although the persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms for more than 48 to 72 hours is unusual. If features of the illness deviate from those that are expected to occur over the self-limited, short course of gastroenteritis, we have to look for other causes. The sharp abdominal pain, chills, and fever that occurred later in the course of the patient\u2019s illness raise concern for a serious intraabdominal infection.\n### Initial Diagnostic Evaluation\n\nThe findings of tachycardia and discomfort unless she was lying flat, with voluntary guarding, are suggestive of a process that is causing peritonitis, and at this point I would be concerned about conditions that can cause an intraabdominal abscess, such as diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, ruptured appendix, and pelvic inflammatory disease. We know the patient is not pregnant and that she has marked leukocytosis. We do not have the results of the initial pelvic examination, but unless an adnexal mass or cervical discharge is present, I would proceed with cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT), rather than ultrasonography, as an initial imaging method, since it is important to obtain images of the gastrointestinal and pelvic organs to determine whether abscess or visceral-organ inflammation is present. I would also contact a surgical colleague to evaluate the patient with me. May we see the imaging studies?*Dr. Alan J. Goldstein:* A CT scan of the abdominal and pelvic regions was obtained after oral and intravenous administration of contrast material. The scan revealed a cystic structure (maximum diameter, 8.8 cm) with an asymmetrically thickened and enhancing wall in the pelvis, associated with the right adnexa. A similar peripherally enhancing cystic structure (maximum diameter, 4.3 cm) was associated with the left adnexa. Other findings included extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, ascites (with a moderate volume of fluid), and mild, diffuse thickening of multiple bowel loops ([Figure 1](#f01)).*Dr. Simmons:* After reviewing the imaging studies, we learn that the patient has bilateral ovarian masses, ascites, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Using this new information, we can reframe the differential diagnosis. Although these findings, when considered in combination with the patient\u2019s clinical history, are suggestive of an infectious process, we must consider the possibility that she may have a benign or cancerous condition involving the ovaries.\n### Ovarian Cancer\n\nHad I seen the radiology report in isolation, I would be very concerned about ovarian cancer. However, it would be unusual for a patient of this age to have ovarian cancer, and she has no family history of ovarian or breast cancer, which lends little support to the possibility that she has a genetic predisposition to early ovarian cancer. Her CA-125 level was markedly elevated, but I will discuss later that this tumor marker is rather nonspecific for ovarian cancer and that CA-125 levels can be elevated in patients who have various peritoneal diseases. At this point, I cannot rule out a diagnosis of ovarian cancer, but I think that the imaging studies showing ovarian masses with rim enhancement are far more likely to suggest an infectious process than cancer. Therefore, I will focus the differential diagnosis on tubo-ovarian infectious conditions.\n### Tubo-Ovarian Abscesses\n\nTubo-ovarian abscesses are manifestations of pelvic inflammatory disease that are usually caused by ascending genital tract infections. The infections that cause the abscesses are often polymicrobial, though *Chlamydia trachomatis* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* may occur in isolation. Risk factors for tubo-ovarian abscesses include sexually transmitted infections, current or prior use of an intrauterine device (IUD), a history of instrumentation inside the genital tract, and a predisposition to gastrointestinal-tract inflammation caused by diseases such as diverticulitis and Crohn\u2019s disease.Our patient reported never having had sexual intercourse. This renders the most common cause of tubo-ovarian abscesses (ascending genital-tract infection in association with *C. trachomatis* or *N. gonorrhoeae* infection) less likely. However, other causes of tubo-ovarian abscesses, including actinomyces and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection, should be considered.Actinomycosis has been reported to be a cause of pelvic infection and may mimic ovarian cancer, since it causes bilateral ovarian masses, peritoneal lymphadenopathy, and elevated CA-125 levels.[1](#core-r001) However, nearly all reports of pelvic actinomycosis involve women who currently have (or have recently had) an IUD in place. This patient has no history of ever having used an IUD. Thus, actinomycosis is an unlikely diagnosis.Pelvic tuberculosis can also mimic ovarian cancer, since it causes adnexal masses, peritoneal lymphadenopathy, and elevated CA-125 levels. This patient\u2019s age is within the range commonly associated with genital-tract tuberculosis, since this infection typically occurs in women who are 25 to 40 years of age.[2](#core-r002) She was born in East Asia and could be at higher risk than the average patient for previous exposure to tuberculosis. However, several features of her presentation are less consistent with a diagnosis of pelvic tuberculosis. Other than a remote history of an ovarian cyst, we have no information suggesting that before this acute illness, the patient was not feeling well; in addition, pelvic tuberculosis typically has an insidious onset. The radiograph of her chest also shows no evidence of a previous granulomatous disease, and although this does not exclude the possibility of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, it makes this diagnosis less likely.\n### Extension of a Bowel Infection\n\nI am concerned that this patient\u2019s pelvic infection could be the result of an extension of a bowel infection. Complications of inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis can lead to formation of a fistula and infection throughout the pelvis. A more acute condition such as diverticulitis or appendicitis can cause extension of infection to involve the adnexa. There was no evidence on the CT scan of underlying bowel-wall thickening suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease, or diverticulitis. The appendix could not be located on the CT scan \u2014 a \u201cnonfinding\u201d that occurs in up to 15% of CT scans.[3](#core-r003) Visualization of a normal appendix on this scan would have been highly reassuring. The absence of a visualized appendix could suggest that the patient has a ruptured appendix, with the appendix now subsumed within the inflammatory mass involving the right adnexa.On my initial review of this case, I believed that a reasonable explanation for this patient\u2019s symptoms was delayed manifestation of intraabdominal infection associated with a ruptured appendix, which resulted in tubo-ovarian abscesses. She did not have the traditional risk factors for tubo-ovarian abscesses (i.e., she had no history of sexual intercourse or use of an IUD). The difficulty of differentiating tubo-ovarian abscesses (particularly tubo-ovarian abscesses that are on the right side only) from acute appendicitis is a well-described clinical challenge.[4](#core-r004)A ruptured bowel with subsequent infection could conceivably cause the development of tubo-ovarian abscesses, but the large cystic structures associated with both ovaries in this patient would be unusual features. I suspect that these cysts are underlying and were preexisting. Although ultrasonography would provide a clearer image of the cysts themselves and would be likely to aid us in reaching a more specific diagnosis, the CT imaging study does show that the patient has cysts (maximum diameters, 8.8 cm and 4.3 cm) associated with her ovaries. These large cysts could represent benign ovarian neoplasms such as cystadenomas, endometriomas, or cystic teratomas.\n### Complications of Benign Ovarian Neoplasms\n\nThere are two possible associations between preexisting ovarian cysts and development of acute abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis: the rupture of a cyst or an infection of a cyst. A ruptured cyst can cause pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Blood from a cystadenoma or endometrioma might be intensely irritating to the peritoneum, and rupture of a teratoma, the contents of which include sebaceous fluid, hair, and cartilage, might also lead to intense irritation. However, this patient had marked leukocytosis and pelvic lymphadenopathy, and her white-cell count decreased after she received treatment with intravenous antibiotic agents. Thus, I suspect she had an infection of an ovarian cyst.\n### Elevated CA-125 Level\n\nHow should we interpret the elevated CA-125 level? As a large transmembrane glycoprotein derived from coelomic mesothelial cells (i.e., cells originating in the pericardium, pleura, or peritoneum) and m\u00fcllerian epithelium (i.e., epithelium that lines the endometrium, endocervix, and fallopian tubes), CA-125 is a nonspecific marker for peritoneal inflammation. Many factors make an elevated CA-125 level unreliable for the screening and diagnosis of ovarian cancer, because many conditions can elevate the CA-125 level ([Table 2](#t02)), and specific patient characteristics can raise and lower the level. For example, CA-125 levels are higher in premenopausal women and in women of African or Asian descent and lower in postmenopausal women, in women who smoke, and in women who have had a hysterectomy.[5](#core-r005) Thus, I do not think that the markedly elevated CA-125 level in this patient is diagnostic of ovarian cancer; rather, it indicates a high degree of pelvic and peritoneal inflammation. If she does have an infected endometrioma, both her underlying endometriosis and the acute infection could account for the elevated CA-125 level.Given the absence in this patient of traditional risk factors for the common causes of tubo-ovarian abscesses, her low risk of ovarian cancer, the presence of large, bilateral ovarian cystic structures, and the markedly elevated CA-125 level, I think that the most likely diagnosis is a ruptured endometrioma. Although a ruptured endometrioma alone can cause peritoneal irritation, I suspect that she has a superimposed infection, given her presenting symptoms and the finding of rim-enhancing masses on the imaging studies. Once an ovarian cyst has been opened to the peritoneum, an infection resulting from the translocation of bowel flora or ascending genital-tract bacteria can develop.I assume that this patient will be evaluated by a gynecologic surgeon. If her infection does not respond to antibiotics, drainage of the abscesses will be at the discretion of the managing surgeon.*Dr. David M. Dudzinski* (Medicine): Dr. Dorney, what was your impression when you evaluated this patient?*Dr. Dorney:* Initially, we were most concerned about the presence of a tubo-ovarian abscess or another infectious process. The patient\u2019s CA-125 level was 196 U per milliliter, but because it was less than 200 U per milliliter in a premenopausal woman, we were less concerned about cancer than we would normally be for a patient with her CA-125 level, although we could not rule out peritoneal carcinomatosis.\n\nDiscussion of Management and Surgical Decision-Making\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n*Dr. David M. Boruta II:* When I evaluated this patient, I was confronted with several key questions: Was surgery necessary? If so, how urgently was it needed, what procedures should be performed, and what approach should be used? Her presentation and imaging findings suggested an infectious process, despite her low risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. Although surgical intervention may be necessary for the treatment of tubo-ovarian abscesses, antibiotic therapy alone may be effective in up to 70% of cases.[6](#core-r006) In other cases, drainage of the abscesses, with the use of interventional radiologic techniques, has been reported to be a successful adjunct to antibiotic therapy.[7](#core-r007)With the patient\u2019s input and consent, a clear plan was developed before surgery, with contingencies for possible findings such as cancer, appendicitis, or bowel perforation. Her desire to preserve fertility and the ability to bear children was established. The risks and benefits of prioritizing these goals, with an emphasis on the use of procedures that would preserve her pelvic organs, if possible, were discussed, along with an explanation of the rationale and potential need for more extensive procedures, such as hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Finally, the safety and feasibility of attempting a minimally invasive, laparoscopic procedure was considered, but we all agreed that a low threshold for conversion to laparotomy, if deemed necessary for safety or for surgical efficacy, would be maintained.Despite the initiation of antibiotic therapy, signs and symptoms developed, including increased abdominal pain and tachycardia, that triggered our concern for a possible rupture of the adnexal mass and sepsis. This prompted our decision to proceed expediently with an operative intervention. Although laparoscopy was initiated, conversion to laparotomy was instituted when extensive peritoneal inflammation with bowel adherence blocking access to the pelvis was encountered. Most reports that describe the successful incorporation of laparoscopy into the management of tubo-ovarian abscesses involve patients who do not have a rupture.[8](#core-r008) In the case of this patient, extensive peritoneal inflammation and agglutination of small bowel and peritoneal surfaces were visualized with the laparoscope. Our priority for ensuring the safety of the patient and efficacious treatment of the conditions we were encountering assumed precedence over our goal of maintaining a minimally invasive approach.At laparotomy, the extent of peritoneal inflammation and the degree to which the right fallopian tube and the right ovary appeared to be abnormal prompted their complete removal. Specimens for bacterial cultures were obtained.Although simple drainage with resection of the abscess cavity has been reported to be an effective strategy for managing tubo-ovarian abscesses, we believe that complete right salpingo-oophorectomy, with preservation of the patient\u2019s uterus and her left adnexa, achieved an appropriate balance between preservation of the patient\u2019s fertility and a more aggressive management strategy (i.e., hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in this patient with evolving sepsis.[8](#core-r008) A rupture of the right cyst, with spillage of purulent material, occurred during dissection of the patient\u2019s right adnexa from the surrounding tissues. A specimen of the fallopian tube and ovary obtained during the right salpingo-oophorectomy was sent for intraoperative pathological examination for assessment of a possible cancer. The left ovarian cyst, which measured 4.3 cm in the maximal diameter, was drained of fluid that was similar in appearance to chocolate syrup \u2014 a feature that was clinically consistent with an endometrioma. The surface of the patient\u2019s appendix was generally inflamed but otherwise appeared normal; however, it was removed to ensure that an underlying appendicitis would not be missed.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Jennifer N. Stall* (Pathology): Specimens obtained during the right salpingo-oophorectomy and the appendectomy were submitted for examination. The patient\u2019s right ovary had been replaced by a unilocular cyst (measuring 9.3 cm by 6.0 cm by 4.0 cm) that was filled with a brown purulent fluid. The lining of the cyst was covered by a yellow exudate. In areas where the exudate was less conspicuous, the underlying tissue was hemorrhagic ([Figure 2A](#f02)). The attached, fimbriated fallopian tube and the appendix (which had been submitted separately) had adhesions and a hemorrhagic serosal surface but were otherwise unremarkable.Examination of a frozen section revealed a cyst with extensive fibrin deposition and acute inflammation; the cyst was benign, and possibly endometriotic. On histologic examination of the permanent sections, the wall of the ovarian cyst was fibrotic and lined by an adherent exudate that was composed of fibrin and inflammatory cells ([Figure 2B and 2C](#f02)). Residual normal ovarian parenchyma was difficult to identify, but the presence of scattered cystic follicles ([Figure 2C](#f02)) confirmed that the abscess was occurring in the ovary. Extensive sectioning revealed background residual foci of endometrioid-type epithelium (i.e., epithelium resembling that seen in the endometrium) and stroma with associated hemorrhage and very few hemosiderin-laden macrophages, features that are diagnostic of an underlying endometriotic cyst ([Figure 2D](#f02)). The fallopian tube was adherent to the ovary owing to the presence of serosal peritonitis but was otherwise unaffected ([Figure 2E](#f02)). The appendix was also histologically unremarkable, except for secondary involvement by the peritonitis on the outer surface. A final diagnosis of an acutely inflamed endometriotic cyst with overlying acute peritonitis involving the ovarian surface, fallopian tube, and appendix was rendered. Three cultures of specimens obtained intraoperatively grew varying amounts of methicillin-sensitive *Staphylococcus aureus,* although a course of antibiotics had been initiated before surgery. Anaerobic, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures were all negative, as were three blood cultures.Most ovarian abscesses that occur in patients in the Western world are associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and are preceded by involvement of the fallopian tube as part of an ascending bacterial infection. Direct extension from nongynecologic infections or hematogenous or lymphatic spread may occur less commonly. The absence of marked tubal involvement, as in this case, is uncommon. As compared with tubo-ovarian abscesses, ovarian abscesses without tubal involvement are frequently unilateral, with bilateral involvement present in only 20% of cases.[9](#core-r009) In contrast to tubo-ovarian abscesses, which frequently involve the surface of the ovary, isolated ovarian abscesses are often unremarkable on the surface, and the abscess becomes apparent only on sectioning. A rupture of the abscess may lead to secondary peritonitis or even fistula formation. Chronic infections may result in the formation of solid, tumorlike masses, which on imaging can potentially raise the possibility of cancer.An extensive body of literature exists regarding the types of infectious organisms associated with tubo-ovarian abscesses, with such abscesses attributed to *N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis,* mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms that are reflective of normal vaginal or cervical flora, and, infrequently, mycobacteria. A less extensive body of literature exists regarding the causative agents in cases of isolated ovarian abscesses. Such cases have revealed a variety of causative organisms, including those found in the urinary, respiratory, or oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal tracts.[10\u201312](#core-r010)A number of theories have been postulated with respect to the route of infection, including direct extension of a nongynecologic infection such as diverticulitis, appendicitis, or inflammatory bowel disease; hematogenous or lymphatic spread from a distant infection; and direct inoculation caused by procedural or operative manipulation of the ovary.[9,10,13,14](#core-r009) Historically, the literature has focused on direct inoculation, with procedural and surgical manipulation being an obvious risk factor. Occasionally, such as in this case, infection of a preexisting cyst may occur. In a study of 510 endometriotic cysts, 11 (2%) had pathological evidence of infection.[15](#core-r015) Endometriosis and endometriotic cysts are commonly associated with a low-grade inflammatory response that is generally chronic. Acute inflammation with abscess formation is rare. Adhesions are a frequent complication; peritonitis occurs less commonly. Rarely, an acute abdominal event, with the potential for exsanguination, may occur.[16](#core-r016) Finally, the potential for endometriosis and endometriotic cysts to progress to cancer (typically, endometrioid or clear-cell) is well known.\n\nFollow-up\n---------\n\n*Dr. Boruta:* A course of intravenous antibiotic therapy was continued for 2 weeks postoperatively. The patient\u2019s recovery was complicated by postoperative ileus and mild incisional cellulitis, each of which was not surprising, given the extent to which her peritoneal cavity was contaminated and inflamed.For any nulliparous woman of reproductive age who presents with acute abdominal symptoms and fever and who has no known history of pelvic inflammatory disease or surgical intervention, a high level of suspicion for an isolated ovarian abscess should be maintained. Prompt imaging, administration of antibiotics, and conservative surgical intervention are essential. If possible, a concurrent culture of a potential primary source of infection should be performed. In the case of an isolated ovarian abscess, the possibility that an infection has spread from a distant site should be considered.\n",

      "question": "A 65-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of bullous cellulitis of the left lower extremity.\nThe patient was in a stable state of health until seven days earlier, when he waded in the muddy waters, with oil slicks, of an estuarial river near Cape Cod to retrieve an anchor. Although he was not aware of any injury, about two hours later he began to experience increasing pain in the left ankle, with erythema, swelling, and tenderness that progressed rapidly up the leg. Six hours thereafter the patient crawled to a telephone to call an ambulance and was taken to another hospital, wrapped in blankets and experiencing shaking chills en route despite an ambient temperature that was close to 32\u00b0C.\nOn examination at that hospital the temperature was 39.8\u00b0C The patient appeared acutely ill. There was diffuse erythema of the left lower extremity from the foot to the knee, with scattered erythema that extended up the medial aspect of the left thigh; areas of fluctuance with marked tenderness and warmth were palpated over the lateral aspect of the anterior compartment, believed suggestive of subcutaneous edema; no signs of deep venous thrombosis were found. The urine was normal. The hematocrit was 46.8 percent; the white-cell count was 12,700, with 92 percent neutrophils, 5 percent band forms, 1 percent lymphocytes, and 2 percent monocytes; the platelet count was 120,000. The urea nitrogen was 5.35 mmol per liter (15 mg per 100 ml), and the creatinine 132.60 \u03bcmol per liter (1.5 mg per 100 ml). The prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and electrolytes were normal. An x-ray film of the chest was reported to be normal. X-ray films of the leg showed no gas within the soft tissues. Microscopical examination of fluid aspirated from the fluctuant area revealed neutrophils and occasional gram-negative microorganisms. Specimens of blood were obtained for culture, and imipenem and penicillin were begun by vein. On the second hospital day the temperature was 37.9\u00b0C, and it did not exceed this level during the remainder of the patient's stay at that hospital. The appearance of the leg was unimproved, and bullae were noted over the left ankle and calf on the third hospital day. Doppler studies were reported to show no evidence of thrombosis. A culture of blood drawn on admission was reported to contain colonies of gram-negative rods that were later identified as a vibrio species. On the eighth hospital day the patient was transferred to this hospital.\nThe patient was a retired police officer, who worked currently as a carpenter. There was a history of hypertension, for which he used an unknown medication. An aortobifemoral bypass graft was performed 10 years before entry because of severe claudication, and a right inguinal herniorrhaphy was performed 7 years later. He had smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 25 years and discontinued this practice at the time of the vascular surgical procedure. He drank small amounts of alcohol. There was no history of tuberculosis, viral hepatitis or other liver disease, receipt of transfusions, chest pain, diabetes mellitus, stroke, recent insect bite, or receipt of immunosuppressive medications; he had been free of claudication since the vascular surgical procedure.\nThe temperature was 37\u00b0C, the pulse was 85, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared well but experienced leg pain on movement. No lymphadenopathy was found. The head was normal except for petechiae of the soft palate. The neck was supple; the carotid pulses were intact, and no bruits were heard. The lungs were clear except for a few crackles at both lung bases. The heart was normal. Abdominal examination was negative; well-healed surgical scars were present; the liver, spleen, and kidneys were not felt. There was ++++ edema with marked erythema of the left lower extremity that extended from just above the toes almost to the knee, with ++ warmth and tenderness; numerous large bullous lesions and denuded bullae with ulcers that contained purulent material were observed within this area, and focal areas on the medial aspect of the left ankle appeared necrotic; evidence of onychomycosis was observed on both feet; the right leg was normal. The right femoral pulse was ++ and the left +; the popliteal pulses were absent; the right posterior tibial was +; the left posterior tibial was + only by Doppler examination; the right dorsalis pedis was + and the left ++ by Doppler examination only; capillary refill was intact bilaterally. The genitalia were normal. Rectal examination showed marked prostatic enlargement, without nodules. Neurologic examination was negative.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 48.6 percent; the white-cell count was 11,800, with 85 percent neutrophils, 1 percent band forms, 6 percent lymphocytes, 7 percent monocytes, and 1 percent metamyelocytes. The platelet count was 278,000. The prothrombin time was 10.2 seconds, with a control of 10.7 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 40.4 seconds. The urea nitrogen was 6.78 mmol per liter (19 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 9.55 mmol per liter (172 mg per 100 ml), the conjugated bilirubin 8.55 \u03bcmol per liter (0.5 mg per 100 ml), the total bilirubin 17.10 \u03bcmol per liter (1.0 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 2.12 mmol per liter (8.5 mg per 100 ml), and the phosphorus 1.10 mmol per liter (3.4 mg per 100 ml). The sodium was 134 mmol, the potassium 4.7 mmol, the chloride 98 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 26 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) was 16 U, the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 121 U, the creatine kinase (CK) 19 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 64 U per liter. An electrocardiogram revealed a normal rhythm at a rate of 81, with minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. An x-ray film of the chest, made with portable technique, disclosed subsegmental atelectasis at the base of the left lung; the remaining lung fields were clear, and the cardiac shadow appeared normal. X-ray films of the left lower leg and foot showed diffuse soft-tissue swelling in the left foot and distal portion of the left calf; no evidence of fracture, soft-tissue gas, bony erosion, or opaque foreign body was detected.\nSpecimens of blood, a swab from a denuded bulla, and aspirated fluid from an intact bulla were obtained for culture, and tetracycline and gentamicin were administered by vein.\nA diagnostic report was received.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Donald E. Craven\\*: An acute cellulitis of the lower extremity and bacteremia developed in this 65-year-old man several hours after he waded into anestuarial river. Three aspects of the history help to determine the cause of his illness \u2014 the presence of a rapidly progressive cellulitis with bullae and sepsis after exposure to salt water, the identification of gram-negative bacilli on a Gram stain of material aspirated from the site of the cellulitis, and the isolation of a vibrio species from a blood culture.The patient had a history of slight alcohol consumption, hypertension, and claudication that required an aortofemoral bypass graft and may have increased his susceptibility to infection. The admission white-cell count of 12,700 with a shift to the left and the decreased platelet count of 120,000 were probably related to the bacteremia and sepsis. There was no evidence of hemolysis, impaired renal or hepatic function, or gas in the soft tissues.May we review the x-ray films?Dr. Daniel I. Rosenthal: Examination of the films of the leg from the knee down reveals very marked edema of the foot and the soft tissue in front of the talonavicular joint. No gas is seen, and the bones appear normal.Dr. Craven: This patient presented with cellulitis and sepsis. Cellulitis is an acute spreading infection of the epidermis and subcutaneous tissues.[1](#core-r001) Trauma or a break in the skin allows penetration of the pathogen, and secondary bacteremia may result. Because cellulitis can be caused by a number of microorganisms it is important to identify the most likely causative agent so that appropriate therapy can be instituted. Possible clues to the infectious agent include the host's age, sex, occupation, hobbies, diet, travel history, and underlying disease, a history of trauma, and the presence of immunosuppression. The site of the cellulitis, the presence of other tissue changes, and the response to antimicrobial therapy may provide additional information. Other soft-tissue infections, such as abscess formation, fasciitis, and myositis, may mimic or coexist with the cellulitis. Treatment for these infections often includes surgical intervention in addition to antimicrobial therapy.In most cases cellulitis is caused by gram-positive cocci such as streptococci and staphylococci. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci are a common cause of cellulitis; Group B, C, or G beta-hemolytic streptococci are implicated less frequently.[2](#core-r002) Erysipelas is a painful, rapidly progressive superficial cellulitis caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Fever, chills, and weakness may occur, but shock is uncommon. The skin is often bright red and warm and has a characteristic peau d'orange appearance without bullae. Aspirates from the advancing edge of the infection rarely contain organisms, and blood cultures are usually negative. Erythema chronicum migrans, the cutaneous lesion of Lyme disease, may resemble erysipelas, but the cellulitis associated with that disease advances more slowly and is not painful.[3](#core-r003)Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci may cause a rapidly progressive cellulitis accompanied by a necrotizing fasciitis (streptococcal gangrene).[1\u20134](#core-r001) Streptococcal gangrene usually develops at a site of trauma on an extremity, but in some cases there is no obvious portal of entry. The patient may appear toxic and have a high fever. The skin lesion is painful, with erythema, edema, bullae, and areas of necrosis. Streptococci can usually be cultured from the bullae and the blood. The patients should be treated with large doses of penicillin G, and prompt surgical incision, drainage, and excision of necrotic tissue should be considered. This patient's rapidly progressive cellulitis with necrosis and marked systemic toxicity might suggest gangrenous cellulitis due to Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, but the Gram stain and cultures that demonstrated gram-negative rods exclude that diagnosis.Bullous skin lesions are more commonly associated with disease due to *Staphylococcus aureus* than streptococci. Bullous impetigo begins as vesicles that evolve into flaccid bullae, which are a cutaneous response to a staphylococcal toxin.[1](#core-r001) This disease is most common in newborns and young children. Staphylococci are regularly isolated from the skin lesions, and there is usually a prompt response to the administration of an antistaphylococcal antibiotic. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) should be suspected in children with fever, a scarlatiniform rash, and bullae that are free of organisms.[4,5](#core-r004) Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) may also present with bullae, and possible causes of TEN include SSSS, drug reactions, and viral illnesses. None of these diseases could explain this patient's illness.*Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae* cellulitis, or erysipeloid, should be considered in a person who has been exposed to saltwater fish or shellfish.[6,7](#core-r006) The infection usually occurs on the hands and is introduced through an abrasion. The lesion is generally painful and violaceous and spreads peripherally, with a raised border and central areas of clearing without bullae. Bacteremia and septic shock have been reported but are rare.[7](#core-r007) Erysipelothrix, a gram-positive rod, is usually not observed on a Gram stain of the drainage material, but it may be isolated by culture or biopsy at the advancing edge of the infection, which responds to treatment with penicillin G. Aquarium workers and fishermen have experienced the development of a cellulitis of the hand that is called \"seal finger.\"[8](#core-r008) This infection spreads slowly, and bullae are not characteristic. Although the cause of seal finger is unknown, treatment with tetracycline appears effective. Neither seal finger nor erysipeloid deserves serious consideration in this case.Anaerobic cellulitis due to clostridial species usually occurs in patients who have devitalized subcutaneous tissues.[1](#core-r001) *Clostridiumperfringens* and other clostridial species thrive in dirty or inadequately debrided wounds. Although the incubation period may be days, once the infection begins it may spread rapidly.[9](#core-r009) There may be crepitus caused by gas in the tissues, but systemic symptoms, local pain, and blebs are not seen. A Gram-stained smear of the discharge usually shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes and numerous large, blunt gram-positive bacilli. Surgical debridement and high-dose penicillin administered intravenously are required for treatment. Bacteroides species (an anaerobic gram-negative rod) and some species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli may produce a similar picture.[10,11](#core-r010) The presence of systemic toxicity and bullae, coupled with the absence of a dirty wound, and the presence of gram-negative bacilli on Gram stain exclude the diagnosis of anaerobic clostridial cellulitis.The clinical differentiation of infections involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues from those involving the fascia and skeletal muscle may be difficult.[1](#core-r001) Gas gangrene or clostridial myonecrosis is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening infection involving skeletal muscle.[1,12](#core-r001) The incubation period may be hours or days, but the onset is often acute and associated with severe pain, mild temperature elevation, and shock. The skin is often tense and edematous, with evidence of blebs and perhaps necrosis. The discharge from the wound or bleb is foul-smelling. Gram stain shows large numbers of gram-positive rods and a few polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Gram-negative bacilli may be seen in mixed infections. X-ray films of the involved areas may show gas in the muscles or fascial planes. Nonclostridial crepitant myositis can be caused by anaerobic streptococci or by *Aeromonas hydrophila*, a facultative anaerobic gram-negative rod.[1,13,14](#core-r001) Although this patient's rapid clinical course and systemic toxicity raise the possibility of gas gangrene, the absence of a traumatic wound or gas in the tissues makes this diagnosis unlikely.Aspiration of material for Gram staining and culture is frequently helpful in defining a pathogen.[15](#core-r015) In this case Gram stain of the fluid aspirated from the fluctuant area of the cellulitis revealed neutrophils and occasional gram-negative rods. Gram-negative bacilli often thrive in water, and certain species are endemic to lakes, rivers, soil, and the sea. These organisms also colonize and cause nosocomial infection in patients in a hospital setting. *Escherichia coli*, klebsiella, enterobacter, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* may cause cellulitis in patients who are immunocompromised or granulocytopenic or have a thermal injury.[1,16](#core-r001) Patients with bacteremia due to *P. aeruginosa* may present with a gangrenous cellulitis that is superficial and painless and located in a nonpressure area. These patients may also have vesicles and bullae that occur singly or in clusters and are often present outside the area of the cellulitis.The family Vibrionaceae contains the genera aeromonas, plesiomonas, and vibrio. Aeromonas and plesiomonas are nonhalophilic (non-salt loving) gram-negative bacilli with predominant polar flagella.[17,18](#core-r017) Aeromonas may be found in fresh water, estuaries, and soil.[17,19](#core-r017) Human infections caused by aeromonas species include a diarrhea syndrome with bacteremia, cellulitis, bullous skin lesions, and wound infection similar to the clinical presentation of this patient. Most of the wound infections are open, traumatic lesions that are contaminated with water, soil, and other bacteria.[13,20,21](#core-r013) Myonecrosis, gas gangrene, and sepsis due to A. *hydrophila* have been reported in patients who are immunologically competent.[13,14](#core-r013) Bacteremia, sepsis, and metastatic lesions involving skin and muscle, however, are more likely to develop in immunocompromised patients.[13](#core-r013) The absence of a contaminated wound and gas in the tissues and the isolation of a halophilic species of vibrio from the patient's blood exclude the diagnosis of aeromonas infection. *Plesiomonas shigelloides* was previously named C27 or *A. shigelloides*.[19](#core-r019) In comparison to vibrios, plesiomonas does not survive well in seawater,[19](#core-r019) and most of the human isolates of plesiomonas have been from stool cultures of patients with diarrhea. Diarrhea due to *P. shigelloides* is more common in tropical areas, and extraintestinal infections are uncommon.[22\u201325](#core-r022)We are told that this patient had bacteremia and sepsis due to a vibrio species. Several reviews and editorials have focused on this diverse and interesting group of organisms ([Table 1](#t001)).l8,26\u201333 Vibrios are actively motile, curved, gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria.[18](#core-r018) In contrast to the Enterobacteriaceae, vibrios are oxidase-positive, have polar flagella, and are halophilic (salt-loving). Proper culture and isolation of vibrio species have been described in detail by Farmer et al.[18](#core-r018) Vibrios are among the most common organisms found in waters in the United States and around the world. Disease caused by vibrios occurs in coastal areas during the summer and fall when water temperatures are conducive to the growth of the organisms. Because shellfish are able to filter and concentrate vibrios, raw or poorly cooked clams or oysters may be the source of human infection.[27\u201334](#core-r027) Lack of refrigeration of contaminated seafood allows the organisms a chance to multiply. Under ideal conditions the doubling time for vibrios may be as short as nine minutes.[35](#core-r035) Previous data have suggested that the dose of vibrios that will infect volunteers given antacids is 105 to 107 organisms,[36](#core-r036) underscoring the requirement of a large inoculum to cause disease in normal hosts. Elderly persons, patients with a previous gastric surgical procedure, and patients who take medications that neutralize or block the production of gastric acid appear to be more susceptible to disease caused by vibrios.[37](#core-r037)*Vibrio cholerae* Group 01 causes cholera, a disease characterized by a profuse, watery diarrhea that can lead to dehydration, shock, and death.[26,27](#core-r026) Contaminated water is the most common source of the organism, but outbreaks due to contaminated food also occur ([Table 1](#t001)). *V. cholerae* is a noninvasive pathogen that produces a powerful enterotoxin, which has been well characterized.[38,39](#core-r038) Patients with severe diarrhea require rapid replacement with fluids, electrolytes, and glucose. An antibiotic such as tetracycline appears to shorten the course of the diarrhea and reduce fluid loss. Cholera is rare in the United States,[26,27,40](#core-r026) and *V. cholerae* is not associated with cellulitis, bacteremia, or sepsis.Non-Group 01 *V. cholerae* has been isolated from patients with gastroenteritis in the United States. The organism may be acquired by eating raw oysters or from patients with travelers' diarrhea.[26,27,41,42](#core-r026) Non-01 *V. cholerae* was identified in 111 of 790 samples (14 percent) of raw oysters screened by the Food and Drug Administration.[26,43](#core-r026) Although bacteremia may occur, wound infection, cellulitis, and septicemia are uncommon in patients without underlying disease.[18,32,44](#core-r018)Infection due to \"non-cholera vibrios\" may cause specific clinical syndromes that are not widely appreciated by the medical community. *V. parahaemolyticus* was first recognized as a pathogen in the early 1950s.[26,27,45\u201348](#core-r026) It is part of the normal flora of estuaries and is present in oysters, crabs, and fish. Pathogenicity of *V. parahaemolyticus* is strongly associated with strains that produce hemolysis on Wagatsuma agar (the Kanagawa phenomenon).[45,47](#core-r045) Most of the outbreaks of disease due to *V. parahaemolyticus* in the United States have been outbreaks of gastroenteritis in persons who have ingested contaminated seafood that was poorly cooked or eaten raw.[26,27,32,49,50](#core-r026) The patients usually present with diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, and chills, which rarely require admission to the hospital or antimicrobial therapy. Wound infections and bacteremia have been reported, but sepsis is rare.[26,27](#core-r026) Previous cases of wound and soft-tissue infections ascribed to *V. parahaemolyticus* have now been attributed to *V. vulnificus*.[27](#core-r027)*V. alginolyticus* was first isolated in 1973 from patients with soft-tissue infections attributed to other vibrios.[51](#core-r051) Since that time there have been several case reports of cellulitis, wounds, and ear infections in young male patients who had prior exposure to seawater.[26,27](#core-r026) Unfortunately, many of the isolates come from wounds, cutaneous ulcers, burns, or the external ear canal, making a clear cause- and-effect association and the response to antibiotics difficult to assess. Although bacteremia may occur in immunosuppressed persons or patients with thermal injury, this species of vibrio would be an unlikely cause of this patient's illness.*V. hollisae, V. damsela*, and *V. mimicus* are non-cholera vibrios that have been described recently but are less frequently associated with human disease. *V. hollisae* has been reported as a cause of gastroenteritis after the ingestion of raw oysters; bacteremia is uncommon.[52](#core-r052) *V. damsela* is known to cause skin lesions in fish and has been isolated from human wounds exposed to salt water.[52](#core-r052) *V. mimicus* has been isolated most commonly from stool samples of patients with gastroenteritis who had ingested raw oysters.[53](#core-r053) Two patients have had *V. mimicus* isolated from the external ear canal after exposure to seawater. These three vibrio species have low virulence and are an unlikely cause of this patient's illness.*V. vulnificus* is a lactose-fermenting, non-cholera vibrio that was first described in 1979.[26,27,54](#core-r026) Previously, *V. vulnificus* was known as *Beneckea vulnifica*, a halophilic, lactose-positive marine vibrio. *V. vulnificus* may be present in the sea or estuaries from the Gulf of Mexico to Cape Cod.[55](#core-r055) The organism prefers to grow in water with a temperature above 20\u00b0C and a saline content between 0.7 and 1.6 percent.[56](#core-r056) The infections are seasonal, with the peak onset of the illness from April to October in the Gulf Coast areas. Like other vibrios *V. vulnificus* is concentrated in filter feeders, such as oysters. Studies have found that more than 50 percent of the oyster lots sampled in the United States contain *V. vulnificus*.[57](#core-r057) This organism is distinct from other vibrios because of its virulence, which may account for the high morbidity and mortality of infections with *V. vulnificus*.[58,59](#core-r058) The presence of a polysaccharide capsule may increase the organism's resistance to phagocytosis and to the bactericidal activity of human serum.[60,61](#core-r060) The increased virulence in the presence of iron[62](#core-r062) may explain the occurrence of septicemia in patients with hemochromatosis.[54](#core-r054) *V. vulnificus* also produces a cytotoxin-hemolysin,[63](#core-r063) collagenase,[64](#core-r064) phospholipases,[65](#core-r065) and a protease that lyses elastin,[66](#core-r066) increasing tissue penetration.Two distinct clinical syndromes have been attributed to *V. vulnificus*. The first is primary bacteremia with secondary seeding of the soft tissues.[26,27,32,67\u201369](#core-r026) The affected patients are usually elderly and male and may have a chronic underlying disease as well as a history of recent ingestion of raw oysters.[26,32,67,68](#core-r026) The onset of disease is rapid and characterized by high fever, chills, and shock. As in patients with other types of gram-negative-rod bacteremia,[70\u201372](#core-r070) shock is present in nearly 33 percent of the patients[32,67,68](#core-r032) and is associated with thrombocytopenia and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, leukopenia, or leukocytosis. Over 70 percent of the patients have secondary cellulitis with characteristic bullous lesions. Many of these patients also have necrotic ulcers, necrotizing fasciitis, or rarely myositis that require surgical debridement and in some cases amputation.[26,27,32,67,68](#core-r026) Fatality rates may exceed 50 percent[26,67](#core-r026) and are greater than 90 percent in patients with shock. The second clinical syndrome is characterized by primary wound infection after exposure to seawater. The patients often have cellulitis and characteristic bullous skin lesions with necrosis followed by bacteremia and sepsis.[67,68,70](#core-r067) This patient had no history of trauma, lacerations, or preexisting wounds on the lower extremity. However, a small puncture wound or break in the skin may have permitted the entry of the organism. Patients presenting with wound infection and contact with seawater are usually elderly men with no history of eating raw oysters.[67](#core-r067) Wound infections caused by *V. vulnificus* range from mild to rapidly progressive cellulitis with necrosis that mimics gas gangrene.[26,67,68,70](#core-r026) Bacteremia has been reported in 42 percent of the cases.[32,67,68](#core-r032) The 16 percent overall fatality rate is lower than that reported for primary bacteremia and is closely associated with the presence of a chronic underlying disease.The early administration of an appropriate antibiotic before the onset of hypotension appears to be important.[26,27,67,69,73](#core-r026) Hollis et al.[74](#core-r074) tested 33 strains by broth, disk, and agar dilution methods and reported that all strains were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, rifampin, and sulfisoxazole. Extrapolation of these data to clinical infection should be done with caution, however. Animal studies have suggested that tetracycline is most effective in vivo.[75](#core-r075) Morris and others[75,76](#core-r075) have advocated treating human infections with tetracycline and an aminoglycoside, even though gentamicin appears to have little in vivo activity in mice. This patient received penicillin and imipenem and appeared to have a clinical response. Although we have little in vitro data and no in vivo data on the efficacy of imipenem against *V. vulnificus*, it was reported to have activity against 38 isolates of the genus vibrio.[77](#core-r077) In addition, some of the quinolone antibiotics, such as norfloxacin, appear to be effective in vitro.[76](#core-r076) This patient was subsequently appropriately treated with tetracycline and gentamicin. The duration of the antibiotic therapy depends on the clinical response. It is likely that surgical debridement and good wound care were also needed to facilitate the healing of the lesions on the lower extremity.Host susceptibility to infection and the virulence of the infecting organism are critical factors in the pathogenesis of infection. In reviewing the literature on infections due to *V. vulnificus* one is struck by the high frequency of infection in elderly men with an underlying disease. With the widespread presence of vibrios in the marine habitat, it is surprising that more infections with this organism have not been reported. Perhaps the virulence of *V. vulnificus* isolates varies or a normal immune system may provide sufficient protection against infection. Recent data have suggested that patients with alcoholic cirrhosis or hepatitis have impaired neutrophil phagocytosis and killing power, which may correlate with increased susceptibility to disease.[78](#core-r078)Prevention of infection due to *V. vulnificus* is of paramount importance. All patients, particularly those who are elderly or have underlying disease, should avoid ingesting raw or poorly cooked shellfish.[26\u201328,31,67,69](#core-r026) The use of protective gloves may decrease the risk of trauma and infection in persons who handle fish and shellfish. In addition, persons with ulcers or open skin lesions should avoid swimming or other contact with seawater. Immediate medical attention should be obtained for any elderly person in whom cellulitis develops after exposure to seawater or the ingestion of raw oysters or clams.In summary, the absence of a specific dietary history of shellfish ingestion or of a portal of entry on the lower leg makes it difficult to determine the pathogenesis of this patient's infection. The rapidly progressive cellulitis with bullae and necrosis as well as the documented hypotension and thrombocytopenia suggest infection caused by *V. vulnificus*. I suspect that he had a wound infection with cellulitis, bacteremia, and sepsis caused by *V. vulnificus*. The report received was probably that of the species of vibrio isolated and perhaps its antibiotic-sensitivity pattern.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Weinstein, will you give us the medical students' diagnosis?Dr. Debra F. Weinstein: The medical students considered a variety of infectious agents but thought that the clinical picture was entirely consistent with *V. vulnificus* infection. They believed that this diagnosis was confirmed by bacteriologic culture.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Scully: Dr. Trucksis, will you describe your impressions when you saw this patient and then tell us about the diagnostic report and what treatment you instituted?Dr. Michele Trucksis: We initially saw the patient in the Emergency Room after his transfer from the other hospital. In view of his contact with seawater, the information that his blood cultures were positive for a vibrio species, and his bullous skin lesions we believed that the diagnosis was *V. vulnificus* cellulitis with bacteremia. The isolate was referred to the Public Health Department State Laboratory. The diagnostic report received was the identification of the isolate as *V. vulnificus*.On the evening of admission we instituted the parenteral administration of tetracycline and gentamicin, the treatment of choice for this infection.[26,67,79](#core-r026) The other important aspect of the treatment is aggressive surgical debridement. He was evaluated by the surgeons on the night of admission, and on the following day extensive debridement was performed.Infections with *V. vulnificus* occur most commonly in persons exposed to seawater along the Gulf of Mexico and the southern Atlantic and Pacific coasts. A water temperature above 20\u00b0C is required for colonization. The occurrence of the organism in the water around Cape Cod correlated with unseasonably warm weather in June and July of 1988. We theorized that the increased water temperature extended its northern range.Dr. Scully: Dr. Susan E. Briggs performed the debridement on the second hospital day. Dr. Googe will describe the pathological specimen.Dr. Paul B. Googe: The specimen consisted of multiple segments of skin and fascia removed from the left leg between the ankle and the knee. The skin was ecchymotic and dusky, with bullae and foci of denuded epidermis. Microscopical examination revealed widespread alterations through all levels of the skin and fascia. Extensive subepidermal bullae, marked superficial dermal edema, a massive infiltrate throughout the subcutaneous fat and dermis, and numerous thromboses in subcutaneous arteries and veins were evident on low-power examination ([Fig. 1](#f001)). The subepidermal bullae were the result of extensive edema in the papillary dermis with associated hemorrhage and fibrin exudation ([Fig. 2](#f002)). Examination of the overlying epidermis showed evidence of ischemia, with pallor and necrosis of keratinocytes, a complication of the formation of bullae as well as the numerous vascular thromboses. Examination of the subcutaneous fat revealed extensive hemorrhage and edema, with many neutrophils and areas of widespread liquefactive necrosis ([Fig. 3](#f003)). Numerous arteries and veins contained acute and organizing thrombi ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The necrosis, thromboses, massive edema, and extensive perineural hemorrhage well explain the pain associated with this disorder. The fascia was likewise involved in the extensive necrosis and suppuration. A necrotizing vasculitis involving venules and capillaries was evident throughout the fascia and focally within the skin ([Fig. 5](#f005)). Examination of numerous sections stained for microorganisms with Gram stains was negative. Several arteries in the skin had thickening of the intima and media, consistent with mild arteriosclerosis and the patient's history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.The changes illustrated are characteristic of *V. vulnificus* soft-tissue infections. Descriptions of the histopathologic changes due to either a primary wound infection or septicemia caused by *V. vulnificus* have been similar to those in this case.[80\u201383](#core-r080) In most of the reported cases the infection was characterized by massive numbers of gram-negative organisms scattered through the tissues, including the bullae, dermis, and subcutaneous fat and around vessels. The absence of demonstrable organisms in this case can be explained by the antibiotic therapy that was instituted approximately eight days before the debridement.The skin changes, as described, may be designated necrotizing cellulitis or fasciitis. The presence of vascular thromboses with ischemic changes also warrants the designation of gangrenous cellulitis. Although the vascular changes might suggest a primary vasculitis, such as polyarteritis nodosa, the extensive suppurative changes and bullae are against that diagnosis.The histopathological differential diagnosis of gangrenous cellulitis includes infections with halophilic vibrios \u2014 *Aeromonas hydrophila, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus anthrax, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Fusobacterium fusiforme, and Mycobacterium ulcerans*.[84,85](#core-r084) Mixed bacterial infections with anaerobes and enteric gram-negative organisms may produce a synergistic gangrenous cellulitis. Aspergillus and phycomycetes species may also cause a gangrenous cellulitis because of their proclivity to grow within the vessels of the subcutaneous tissue. Cutaneous anthrax, clostridial cellulitis, and *M. ulcerans* are toxin-producing infections that are typically associated with extensive ischemic necrosis, large numbers of organisms, and little inflammatory response. Ecthyma gangrenosum, caused by pseudomonas, likewise often elicits little inflammatory response, with many organisms visible in and about blood vessels.The diagnosis of these infections may be suggested by the morphologic features of the bacteria in tissue sections but should be confirmed by culture whenever possible. Information regarding the anatomical location, clinical appearance of the lesions, physical and laboratory examination of the patient, and epidemiologic pattern in a given case are critical to the early diagnosis, and this information should be conveyed to the pathologist and microbiologist involved in the case. The culture results and the tissue alterations in this case are diagnostic of *V. vulnificus* gangrenous cellulitis.Vulnificus, Latin for \"wounding,\" is a good name for this vibrio, which may cause extensive soft-tissue destruction. Other marine halophilic vibrios, including *V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus*, and *V. damsela*, have been reported to cause similar soft-tissue infections or septicemias in human beings.[26,30,32](#core-r026) *V. vulnificus*, however, is the most common of these species involved. As mentioned, *V. vulnificus* produces cytotoxins, proteases, phospholipases, and collagenases.[29](#core-r029) The cytotoxin causes death of lipocytes, endothelial cells, and myocytes in animal models.[86](#core-r086) Proteases stimulate mast-cell degranulation, with histamine release, and also activate the plasma kallikrein\u2013kinin system, with bradykinin generation.[87](#core-r087) These cytotoxin and protease activities promote thrombosis and edema with resultant ischemia, which may compound the direct effects of the toxin. The potency of these toxins was evident in this case in the prolonged tissue damage present days after the start of antibiotic therapy. Thus, debridement is essential to remove devitalized tissues that might otherwise harbor infection, provide portals for secondary infection, and cause systemic effects by releasing cellular byproducts of autolysis.Of interest is the rarity of serious infections with these halophilic vibrios in the light of their widespread distribution in the oceans of the world and the millions of persons who depend on the ocean for nourishment, vocation, and recreation. Although vibrio species have been shown to be pathogenic in eels,[88](#core-r088) damselfish,[89](#core-r089) and salmon,[90](#core-r090) the biotype of *V. vulnificus*, which causes infection in human beings, has not yet been demonstrated to be a common cause of infection in marine animals.[91](#core-r091) The virulence of *V. vulnificus* is related to encapsulation[60](#core-r060); other inherent determinants of virulence are unknown. Host factors are important in human disease, although infection does occur occasionally in apparently healthy persons. Perhaps a complement deficiency, either hereditary or acquired, predisposes to serious *V. vulnificus* infection. Such a deficiency has been described in patients with other infections caused by encapsulated organisms, including meningococcemia and gonorrhea.[92](#core-r092)It is important to recognize that the marine noncholeragenic vibrios, including *V. vulnificus*, may be found throughout the marine environment and that their presence does not appear to be related to human fecal contamination or chemical pollution. Thermal pollution, however, may theoretically affect local colony counts in coastal waters.According to Greg Early and Dr. Paul Boyle of the New England Aquarium (personal communications), the marine vibrios are being studied with great interest in regard to their possible roles as pathogens in nature. We can look forward to new information concerning the ecologic role of these bacteria in nature and their relation to disease in marine animals and human beings.Dr. Scully: Dr. Trucksis, will you give us the follow-up findings on the patient?Dr. Trucksis: Cultures of all the samples of blood and surgical samples were negative for growth of vibrio species at this hospital. He received a three-week course of tetracycline plus gentamicin and required multiple surgical debridements but finally recovered with skin grafting.Dr. Craven: Was there any evidence of myositis or myonecrosis?Dr. Googe: We did not receive any muscle tissue. It must have appeared uninvolved to the surgeon.\n",

      "question": "A 20-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of chronic right otitis media.\nThe patient had been well until one year earlier, when a \u201cbad cold\u201d developed, with a sore throat. The sore throat subsided after one week, but nasal congestion and the sensation that her ears were blocked persisted for a month. A physician made a diagnosis of sinusitis and prescribed a nasal spray and an unknown antibiotic. The left ear became clear, but the right ear remained symptomatic. Treatment with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole provoked a rash and was discontinued, and a third antibiotic was ineffective. Painless drainage from the right ear developed, with diminished hearing. An audiometric examination revealed loss of conductive hearing in the right ear. The patient had a purulent nasal discharge and postnasal drip during the rest of the year. Three months before admission, a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the temporal bones (\nFigure 1\n) showed opacification of the right middle ear and mastoid bone, without erosion of the scutum, ossicular chain, or otic capsule. The external canal, the contour of the posterior nasopharynx, and the visible portions of the paranasal sinuses appeared normal. Insertion of a tympanostomy tube did not improve hearing and was followed by a perforation that involved 30 percent of the eardrum.\nEvaluation of the patient at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary a month before admission revealed a perforation in the inferior portion of the right tympanic membrane. Inspissated white material that filled the middle ear appeared to be solid granulation tissue. A Rinne test was normal. The left ear was normal. Mucopurulent material was present in both sides of the nasal passage and in the nasopharynx, which was inflamed. Both eustachian tubes appeared to be occluded by mucosal swelling; the mucosa of the right tube was pale white. There was no evidence of facial-nerve weakness or spontaneous nystagmus.\nRoutine laboratory tests were normal except that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 32 mm per hour. A test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) was negative. Microscopical examination of stained smears of material from the right ear canal showed no neutrophils, acid-fast bacilli, or other bacteria, and cultures yielded only\nStaphylococcus epidermidis\n. Prednisone (20 mg daily) was prescribed, but the patient's condition did not improve.\nAt a follow-up examination 19 days later, a crust in the deep portion of the ear canal was removed, and granular changes were observed along the handle of the malleus. Radiographs of the chest (\nFigure 2\n) showed a curvilinear opacity in the right upper lung that was consistent with the presence of a scar. The lungs were otherwise clear, and the cardiomediastinal silhouette and bony structures appeared normal.\nThe patient had grown up in a large city in China. She had had viral hepatitis A at nine years of age. An uncle and a grandfather had been treated for pulmonary infections when she was a child, but she did not know the diagnosis. She believed that she might have received bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine in childhood. She immigrated to the United States at the age of 15 years. Two years before admission, a tuberculin skin test was positive; a subsequent chest radiograph showed normal findings. No treatment was administered. There was no history of recent fever, sweats, ear pain, or weight loss.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital, where the results of a physical examination were normal except for the findings in the head.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. David M. Vernick[\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic findings?Dr. James D. Rabinov: Bone windows of the axial CT images show that the mastoid air cells are well formed but opacified ([Figure 1](#f01)). The right middle ear is also opacified, but the ossicles are intact. There is no evidence of bone destruction or demineralization on either the axial or coronal CT study.The chest film shows a small scar in the right upper lobe ([Figure 2](#f02)). The hilar structures are normal, and there is no pleural effusion.Dr. Vernick: Patients with chronic or recurrent ear drainage are often seen by otologists. Most patients with this disorder have a hole in the eardrum and a bacterial infection in the middle ear, with purulent, often malodorous drainage. After a history has been taken and a physical examination performed, the initial intervention involves cleaning out the drainage from the ear and providing the patient with appropriate antibiotic medication to be administered both orally and locally in the form of ear drops. The initial choice of antibiotics is usually empirical, with a drug chosen that is effective against the two pathogens most commonly associated with chronic or recurrent ear drainage: staphylococcus and pseudomonas. Follow-up examination of patients is necessary to monitor the response to antibiotic therapy.When medication fails to eradicate the infection, an effort must be made to determine the cause of the treatment failure. The patient's medical history should be reviewed for any systemic illnesses that could affect the ear. The findings in the ear should be reevaluated. Is an underlying cholesteatoma present? Culture of the discharge should be screened for atypical infectious agents and resistant strains of bacteria. Uncommon causes of chronic otorrhea should be considered. Radiographic imaging of the ear \u2014 usually CT scanning \u2014 should be performed to evaluate the extent of the disease and the status of the bony framework. Audiometry should be performed to assess the severity of the damage.Most infectious causes of chronic ear drainage ([Table 1](#t01)) are bacterial.[1,2](#core-r001) When the middle ear is infected, the mastoid cavity also becomes involved, since it is directly continuous with the middle ear. Systemically administered antibiotics are therefore necessary. Failure of the infection to disappear after appropriate antibiotic therapy has been administered indicates that the infectious agent is resistant to the antibiotic chosen or that the otorrhea is not due to a bacterial infection. Culture of a specimen of the discharge, preferably obtained a day or two after all medication has been stopped, can help direct further therapy. Aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal cultures should be performed, accompanied by sensitivity testing. Cultures for mycobacteria should be performed if the clinical picture suggests that they may be the causative organisms. Viral infections of the ear have been reported infrequently.Cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea may occur after trauma, such as a fracture of the temporal bone or an operation, or may develop spontaneously in rare cases. The discharge is clear and can be profuse. The ear otherwise looks normal. Measurement of the glucose level in the cerebrospinal fluid or, when necessary, performance of a beta2-transferrin assay, can help confirm the diagnosis. In difficult cases, an assay of the otorrhea can be performed after injection of a radionuclide or fluorescein into the cerebrospinal fluid.A foreign body in the ear canal or middle ear can result in chronic otorrhea. Unless the foreign body has been removed,[3](#core-r003) medical therapy is usually ineffective. This diagnosis should be suggested by the history, as well as the presence of a discrete area of infection.Tumors of the ear can become secondarily infected, with chronic or recurrent otorrhea as the initial manifestation.[1,4](#core-r001) Cholesteatoma, a cutaneous cyst in the middle ear, is by far the most common of these tumors. Malignant neoplasms such as squamous-cell carcinoma and, in rare cases, benign neoplasms may have moist surfaces and become secondarily infected. A biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis when a tumor other than cholesteatoma is suspected. If such a tumor is present, the CT scan may show bony erosion.Systemic illnesses such as Wegener's granulomatosis can cause obstruction of the eustachian tube in the nasopharynx, resulting in chronic otorrhea.[1](#core-r001) The results of a general physical examination performed before one focuses on the ear may strongly suggest this diagnosis. Examination of the nose and nasopharynx may show granular mucosal changes suggestive of Wegener's granulomatosis.In the case under discussion, the laboratory data were not very helpful, with stained smears and cultures showing only *S. epidermidis,* a common organism in the ear. Despite a negative ANCA test, prednisone was administered, but it was ineffective. Since the diagnostic approach was unrevealing, further evaluation was necessary. A biopsy of the middle-ear tissue, with both histologic examination and culture of specimens, should have been the diagnostic procedure.The tubercle bacillus was discovered by Koch in 1882. The following year it was isolated from a middle-ear lesion.[5,6](#core-r005) It has been estimated that early in this century, half the cases of suppurative otitis media in children under one year of age and 27 percent of the cases in children under two years of age were caused by this bacillus. Three to 5 percent of all cases of chronic otitis media were tuberculous.[1,7](#core-r001) The tubercle bacillus, which was often transmitted in unpasteurized milk, spread to the middle ear through the eustachian tube. In patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, infection of the middle ear was thought to occur by a hematogenous route. In patients with a middle ear communicating with the outer ear, direct spread through the ear canal occasionally occurred.[8\u201310](#core-r008)Since the introduction of antituberculosis therapy, pasteurization of milk, and BCG vaccination, the frequency of middle-ear tuberculosis has become so low in this country that there are only a few case reports in the literature.[11,12](#core-r011) Because of the paucity of teaching cases, many physicians do not consider this disease, and their clinical experience with it is too limited to make them familiar with the characteristic physical findings.Textbook descriptions of aural tuberculosis include painless otorrhea, which is usually profuse, with multiple perforations of the tympanic membrane and preauricular lymphadenopathy.[1,2,4,10,11,13\u201315](#core-r001) Facial palsy and hearing loss have been reported frequently, and granulation tissue has been present in many cases. Bezold's abscess (an abscess of the mastoid tip), systemic symptoms, and especially pulmonary symptoms have been reported. Central nervous system involvement is rare, probably because the dura serves as a protective barrier.Recent reports of middle-ear tuberculosis present a different picture.[7,8,11,16\u201318](#core-r007) A single perforation of the tympanic membrane is common. In some cases, the eardrum disappears, exposing the malleus and sometimes the promontory of the middle ear. Conductive hearing loss usually occurs; without treatment, it can progress to profound sensorineural loss. Granulation tissue in the middle ear is usually pale instead of beefy red. The exudate in the middle ear may be thick and is sometimes confused with the infected keratin debris of a cholesteatoma. Periauricular fistulas, lymphadenopathy, and facial palsy are infrequent findings.[17,18](#core-r017)Radiologic findings are often nonspecific.[19,20](#core-r019) Bony erosion is uncommon, but demineralization of the bone has been reported. The diagnosis of the infection rests on identification of the organism by means of culture or histologic studies. Unfortunately, culture of the discharge has a low yield.[16](#core-r016) Biopsy of the granulation tissue, with histologic examination as well as culture of the tissue, has the best results. The disease is treated mainly with antituberculosis medication, usually a multidrug regimen. Surgery may have a role in the resolution of the disease but is not curative by itself, and its contribution is unclear.[10,16,17,21](#core-r010) Operations to repair damage to the middle ear and eardrum should be delayed until the infection has been eradicated.Several features of the history should be considered in this case. The patient grew up in a large city in China, a country where tuberculosis is much more common than it is in the United States. Members of the patient's family had pulmonary infections that may have been tuberculous. She had a positive tuberculin skin test, a finding related either to BCG vaccination or to undiagnosed tuberculosis. She had drainage from the ear for a year that was unresponsive to multiple antibiotic regimens. The granulation tissue in the middle ear was white. The radiographs showed no bony erosion and no abnormalities in the paranasal sinuses or nasopharynx. Laboratory tests were normal.The course of this patient's illness is not typical of a chronic bacterial otitis. It did not respond to antibiotics. The absence of radiologic evidence of involvement of the paranasal sinuses or nasopharynx and the negative ANCA test are evidence against the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.The patient underwent a diagnostic procedure. I expect that this was a biopsy of the middle-ear tissue, the results of which should have confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis.Dr. Eugene J. Mark: Dr. Staecker, as the surgeon who saw this patient, will you comment?Dr. Hinrich Staecker: It was clear that this patient's presentation was not characteristic of chronic otitis media. Our differential diagnosis included both Wegener's granulomatosis and mycobacterial infection. We performed an ANCA test, although we realized that the result is negative in 15 percent of cases of localized Wegener's granulomatosis, and we obtained specimens for culture from the ear canal. Since the cultures were unrevealing, we treated the patient presumptively with prednisone and made plans for a definitive biopsy. A simple mastoidectomy, excision of granulation tissue, and tympanoplasty were performed. Specimens were sent to the pathology department for examination and to the microbiology laboratory for aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Suzanne B. Keel: Intraoperative examination of frozen sections showed amorphous, necrotic material. Examination of the permanent sections revealed that almost all the tissue was necrotic. A small amount of preserved, edematous middle-ear tissue contained an infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and foci of histiocytes ([Figure 3](#f03) and [Figure 4](#f04)). No caseating granulomas were seen. Necrosis and inflammation were present adjacent to a small nerve, and fragments of dead bone were embedded in necrotic tissue. There were also areas of fibrosis. Ziehl\u2013Neelsen staining demonstrated clusters of red acid-fast bacilli within the necrotic tissue ([Figure 4](#f04), inset). Cultures of the nasopharynx yielded *Mycobacterium tuberculosis.*Less than 0.1 percent of cases of otitis media and mastoiditis are caused by *M. tuberculosis*.[22](#core-r022) In a study reported in 1986, tuberculous otitis media in adults was associated with *M. tuberculosis* infection elsewhere in the body in 58 percent of the cases,[11](#core-r011) but the increasing numbers of immunocompromised persons infected with *M. tuberculosis* may have changed this percentage. The prevalence of tuberculous otitis media with another identified site of infection is only 0.2 to 0.7 percent. Staining of the biopsy specimen for acid-fast organisms is important, since it may result in identification of the bacilli weeks before cultures become positive, and prompt therapy may salvage the patient's hearing.Dr. Mark: Dr. Durand, you were the consultant for the Infectious Disease Service. Will you tell us about this patient's treatment?Dr. Marlene L. Durand: We administered a four-drug regimen of antituberculosis therapy initially. Since the organism isolated was sensitive to isoniazid and rifampin, the patient is now receiving only these two agents for the remainder of her nine-month course of therapy. She has had a very good response, and a recent hearing test was normal.A question that is not often addressed in the literature on tuberculous otitis media is whether it is contagious. We reasoned that since the eustachian tube connects the middle ear with the nasopharynx, drainage from the opening of the eustachian tube might be important in this respect. Immediately on diagnosis, therefore, the patient was returned to a negative-pressure isolation room in order to obtain specimens of the discharge from the eustachian tube for smears and cultures. The results were positive, proving that tuberculous otitis media can be contagious. The middle-ear specimen that was positive for acid-fast bacilli on special histologic staining was negative on culture.Dr. Mark: There are three portals through which tubercle bacilli enter the body: the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, and the skin (by inoculation). How well documented is the ear as a portal of entry? How can one rule out an occult focus of tuberculosis in the lung in cases in which entry through the outer ear is postulated?Dr. Vernick: I can say only that some patients with perforated eardrums have reportedly acquired the infection through the ear canal.\n",

      "question": "A three-year-old boy was referred to the hospital for cardiac evaluation because of a murmur that was increasing in volume.\nHe was born of a full-term second pregnancy to a mother 28 years of age. His birth weight was 4.0 kg. The child was discharged home with his mother two or three days after birth but was readmitted a few days later because of abdominal swelling. He was found to have bilateral hydronephrosis with megaureters, bladder diverticula, posterior urethral valves, and urinary ascites. A transurethral resection of the valves was performed, with reimplantation of both ureters and the later performance of a right-to-left transureteroureterostomy, with revision of the reimplantation of the left ureter. Repeated urinary tract infections were suppressed by the administration of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and hypertension was managed with chlorothiazide. Because of worsening function of both kidneys a colon-loop ureterostomy was planned.\nAt the age of 3 1/2 months a heart murmur had been detected and was heard intermittently thereafter. During the year before admission the murmur became louder. The patient's sister, 10 years old, was said to have had repeated upper respiratory tract infections. The mother had undergone ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus in childhood. The child's exercise tolerance was slightly decreased, but there was no history of cyanosis or other cardiovascular symptoms.\nThe pulse was 90, and the respirations were 22. The blood pressure was 130/75 mm Hg in the right arm and right leg. The height was 100 cm (50th percentile), and the weight 13.5 kg (50th percentile).\nOn physical examination the boy was well developed and cooperative. The jugular venous pressure was normal, and the lungs were clear. The cardiac apical impulse was slightly hyperactive; the heart sounds were normal, with splitting of S\n2\n; a Grade 3, harsh, long systolic ejection murmur was loudest at the left midsternal border, with radiation to the upper right sternal border and cardiac apex; no ejection click or diastolic murmur was heard. The liver edge was palpated 1 cm below the right costal margin. The femoral pulses were equal in volume and intensity to the pulses in the arms. There was no peripheral edema, digital clubbing, or cyanosis.\nThe urine gave a negative test for protein and had a pH of 5.0 and a specific gravity of 1.010; the sediment contained 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field. The hematologic laboratory findings are presented in\nTable 1\n. The urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, and electrolytes were normal except that the sodium was 130 meq (mmol) per liter. An electrocardiogram revealed a normal rhythm at a rate of 100, with a mean QRS axis of +30 degrees; there was a pattern of right ventricular conduction delay, without evidence of ventricular hypertrophy; the ST segments and T waves were normal. Radiographs of the chest disclosed low lung volumes; the lung fields were clear, the pulmonary vasculature was slightly increased, and the heart size was normal.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Michael D. Freed\\*: This case concerns a three-year-old boy with severe obstructive uropathy and a heart murmur of increasing intensity, suggesting a progressive cardiac abnormality. May we see the x-ray films of the chest?Dr. Johan G. Blickman: The radiographs of the chest reveal normal lung volumes, normal cardiac contour and size, and minimally increased pulmonary vascular markings.Dr. Freed: Although this child was referred for cardiac evaluation, his previous medical problems involved principally the urinary tract. In the perinatal period he had abdominal swelling and was found to have bilateral hydronephrosis, with megaureters secondary to posterior urethral valves.Posterior urethral valves, which occur in about 1 in 5000 males, are sail-shaped membranes distal to the verumontanum that obstruct the outflow of urine but allow retrograde passage of catheters or irrigating fluid. The obstruction leads to a high bladder pressure with progressive thickening and fibrosis of the bladder wall, which may result in distortion of the ureterovesical junction, causing further obstruction or reflux, or both. These abnormalities in the lower urinary tractcan lead to dilatation of the ureters and kidney, and when they occur in utero during the development of the kidneys they may result in renal dysplasia with decreased renal function.[1](#core-r001)Could this genitourinary tract abnormality have been related to the child's cardiac problem? Two possibilities come to mind. Either the congenital urinary tract abnormality was associated with a congenital cardiac defect or the urinary anomaly or its treatment caused an abnormality in the heart. The association between congenital malformations in the cardiovascular system and various other malformations is well known. Although chromosomal abnormalities, including single-gene defects, may cause multiorgan systemic disease, there is no evidence in this child of any syndrome of this type.Children with both urinary tract and cardiac abnormalities have been described, however. An association is a nonrandom occurrence of anomalies and is a statistical rather than a pathophysiologic mechanistic concept. Sometimes the association is of sufficient import to warrant a specific designation, but the associations are usually more subtle and either of not enough importance or sufficiently rare to have escaped an acronym or eponym thus far. In a review of 1566 infants with severe congenital heart disease born in New England between 1968 and 1972, 5 percent had an abnormality of the urinary system.[2](#core-r002) Ferencz and her coworkers,[3](#core-r003) in a case\u2013control study of approximately 1500 infants with heart disease in the Baltimore\u2014Washington, D.C., area, found an increase in the frequency of genitourinary tract abnormalities in the cardiac group \u2014 18 cases (10 with hydronephrosis) as compared with only 4 cases in the control group (P = 0.0032). The type of cardiac malformation was not mentioned, however, and we cannot be certain whether the hydronephrosis was due to posterior urethral valves. In the case under discussion I am left with the conclusion that the association between urinary tract abnormalities and heart disease has been reported, [2,3](#core-r002) but the data do not point to a specific type of heart disease to help me in the differential diagnosis.The second possibility is that a complication of this boy's disease or its treatment affected the heart. Complications of posterior urethral valves usually involve the genitourinary tract. Urinary extravasation leading to a urinoma or ascites, vesicourethral reflux, hydronephrosis, deteriorating renal function, and azotemia are the most common complications, but they should not affect the heart. Urinary tract infections are also common, but an infection that had spread to the heart would almost certainly cause valvar regurgitation rather than obstruction, which as we shall see later is inconsistent with the murmur described. Also, infection would be unlikely in a healthy-appearing child in the absence of fever, anemia, or an elevated white-cell count. Therefore, I am unable to associate the urinary tract abnormality with the later development of the systemic murmur.The second potential diagnostic clue is that the mother had undergone ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus in childhood. Our understanding of the inheritance of congenital heart disease has been improving slowly with advances in molecular genetics, population data to determine the risk ratio in siblings, and longer survival of probands with congenital heart disease, allowing examination of their children.[4\u20137](#core-r004)Five to 8 percent of patients with congenital heart disease have a chromosomal abnormality, usually trisomy 21 but occasionally trisomy 13 or 18, or the 45,X Turner's syndrome. There is nothing to suggest the presence of those abnormalities in this case. About 3 percent of patients with congenital heart disease have typical mendelian single-gene defects. Dominant transmission has been described in association with more than 20 syndromes, including the Holt\u2014Oram, Noonan, and Marfan syndromes, and recessive chromosomal inheritance is seen with others, especially with Type IIA glycogen storage disease (Pompe's disease) and the Ellis\u2014van Creveld syndrome. Nothing in this case suggests that this child had any of those syndromes.The vast majority of children with heart disease do not belong in any of these categories. Empirical observation has indicated that the risk of recurrence in siblings for patent ductus arteriosus is about 3 percent, below that observed in typical mendelian inheritance but 100-fold higher than expected by chance alone. In the early 1960s geneticists advanced the theory of polygenetic, multifactorial inheritance of certain congenital defects, including those of the heart, assuming that the phenotype depended on the interaction of several genes (the genetic milieu) but required an environmental trigger.[8](#core-r008) The basic features of this model suggest that the recurrence risk should be equal in siblings and offspring and should be approximately equal to the square root of the prevalence in the population. The risk is decreased in more distant relatives but increased when many family members are affected. Data provided in an M.D. thesis by Zetterqvist,[9](#core-r009) cited by Bern,[5](#core-r005) supported this mode of inheritance for patent ductus arteriosus. The risk of recurrence has been found to be 2.3 percent for siblings and 2.5 percent for offspring, but only 0.6 percent for second-degree and third-degree relatives; if more than one sibling had a patent ductus arteriosus, the risk to subsequent children was 10 percent. Except for patent ductus arteriosus, however, the data for a multifactorial model in congenital heart disease are not very strong. The prediction that absolute risk should be higher with common lesions than with rare ones has not always fit, and recently several studies have found that the risk of transmission in offspring is considerably higher than the risk in siblings.[10,11](#core-r010) It is currently uncertain whether these variations are attributable to a problem with the model, bias introduced by the ascertainment of severe heart disease, simplistic assumptions about lesions that may be a mixture of dominant, recessive, and nongenetic causes, differing pathophysiologic mechanisms for different cardiac malformations,[12](#core-r012) or changes in the frequency of environmental triggers.How does genetics help in this case? If I assume that this child's murmur was organic, he was one of the 2 to 3 percent of children of mothers with a patent ductus arteriosus who have heart disease. Usually the heart disease is concordant, so that there was about a 50 percent chance that his heart disease was the same as his mother's \u2014 that is, a patent ductus arteriosus. However, unless children with a small patent ductus arteriosus have pulmonary-artery hypertension, they have a characteristic machinery murmur, best heard under the left clavicle with radiation into the left axilla and back, unlike the ejection murmur described in this case. With pulmonary-artery hypertension, the diastolic component of the murmur may be lost in these children, but with normal splitting of the second heart sound without cyanosis, right ventricular hypertrophy demonstrable on the electrocardiograms, or a dilated pulmonary artery with shunt vascularity shown on x-ray films, the diagnosis of a patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary-artery hypertension is unlikely. If the mother has a patent ductus arteriosus and the offspring has heart disease but not a patent ductus arteriosus, the literature is not helpful in suggesting a specific diagnosis. The information that the child's mother had a patent ductus increases the possibility that the murmur was organic rather than functional but does not point to a specific diagnosis.The next clue is the child's hypertension. The clinicians caring for him presumably thought that it was secondary to the renal disease, but it would be somewhat unusual for a child with obstructive uropathy to have this degree of hypertension with normal renal function and no proteinuria. Other causes of hypertension, such as endocrine, metabolic, neurologic, or drug-related causes, should be excluded, but I find no evidence of them. Two vascular causes of hypertension should be mentioned. Coarctation of the aorta is excluded by the presence of femoral pulses that were equal in volume and intensity to the pulses in the arms and by the equal blood pressures in the right arm and leg. Another possibility that would link hypertension, a heart murmur, and renal disease is Williams' syndrome,[5\u20138](#core-r005) characterized by vascular stenosis, usually at the origin of major arteries from the aorta, and supravalvar aortic stenosis or peripheral pulmonary stenosis, or both. Hypertension may be due to stenosis of the renal vessels or renal parenchymal disease. Affected children have a short stature, delayed development, and the characteristic \"elfin facies,\" with a receding mandible, depressed bridge of the nose, relatively large mouth, prominent lips, low-set ears, prominent eyes, and occasionally esotropia and hypertelorism. That diagnosis is unlikely, since I doubt that the clinicians would have missed the characteristic facies and developmental delay in that disease, and the structural urinary tract abnormalities reported in the largest series of cases of urinary abnormalities in Williams' syndrome did not involve posterior urethral valves or other causes of obstructive uropathy.[13](#core-r013)This patient's only cardiac symptom was a slight decrease in exercise tolerance, which might suggest limitation in the ability of the heart to deliver sufficient oxygen to the periphery, as seen with either a limited cardiac output or right-to-left shunting. Unfortunately, this sign is very \"soft,\" since there is marked variation both in the activity level of normal children and, at least as important, the parental perception of what is \"normal\" activity. The noncardiac portion of the physical examination was negative, and the electrocardiographic finding of left ventricular predominance and the radiologic finding of prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings were also probably within the normal range.Thus far, I have had limited help from the history, the noncardiac physical examination, and the laboratory tests. In the clinical practice of pediatric cardiology this situation is not unusual. Outside the perinatal period, when 50 to 60 percent of children with heart disease present, cardiovascular problems are rarely important hemodynamic problems, and we are frequently called on to make a differential diagnosis on the basis of the cardiac examination, usually auscultation. Although auscultation with a variety of maneuvers has a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in adults with a limited number of diagnoses, the results are less rewarding in children, with the more limited armamentarium of techniques, a multitude of congenital problems, and frequently lack of cooperation, if not downright hostility from the patient.[14](#core-r014)Numerous classifications of congenital heart disease have been suggested over the years to organize the hundreds of abnormalities and permutations and combinations of those abnormalities that can affect the heart. One of the best is that suggested by Perloff,[15](#core-r015) which I shall modify slightly for the purpose of this discussion ([Table 2](#t002)).The first question is whether the child was cyanotic. In this case there is no evidence of cyanosis in the history or physical examination, and the normal second heart sound, the relatively normal x-ray films of the chest and electrocardiogram, and the absence of polycythemia exclude virtually all forms of cyanotic heart disease.If this child was not cyanotic, the second question is whether the pulmonary blood flow was increased. The answer distinguishes children with cyanotic heart disease with a left-to-right shunt from those with valvar obstruction or regurgitation. Shunting, when it occurs, can be at the great-vessel, ventricular, or atrial level. I do not think that a left-to-right shunt was present in this child. In addition to the absence of evidence of shunt vascularity on the x-ray films of the chest, shunting at the level of the great vessels is associated with a continuous murmur (not present in this child), since the aortic pressure exceeds the pulmonary-artery pressure throughout the cardiac cycle unless pulmonary hypertension is present. As I mentioned earlier, the normal second heart sound and the absence of right ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiographic examination exclude pulmonary hypertension. Shunting at the ventricular level is ruled out by the characteristics of the heart murmur, which was described as ejection rather than pansystolic, suggesting that the turbulence started after isovolumic contraction rather than at the beginning of systole, when the left ventricular pressure exceeds the right ventricular pressure.[16](#core-r016) The murmur is consistent with an atrial-level left-to-right shunt, since the murmur associated with a lesion of this type is caused by relative pulmonic stenosis and an increased volume of right ventricular ejection through a structurally normal pulmonic valve. With atrial-level shunts, however, the increased cardiac impulse is over the right ventricle, the pulmonic component of the second heart sound is widely split without respiratory variation, and the right ventricular dilatation causes an rsR' pattern over the right chest leads on the electrocardiogram. None of these findings were present in this case. A partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection with one pulmonary vein entering the right atrium cannot be excluded, but nothing suggests that diagnosis.Exclusion of left-to-right shunting leaves valve obstruction or regurgitation to explain the murmur. Regurgitation can be excluded, since aortic or pulmonic regurgitation would result in a diastolic murmur and regurgitation of the mitral or tricuspid valve would result in a pansystolic murmur rather than the ejection murmur described.The obstructive lesion could have been on either side of the heart. Right-sided obstruction can be caused by subvalvar pulmonary stenosis, often called \"anomalous muscle bundles in the right ventricle\" and frequently associated with a ventricular septal defect, since the obstruction is directly under the sternum, and even mild stenosis results in a very loud murmur and thrill. Valvar pulmonary stenosis would be distinctly unusual in the absence of a variable ejection click, and supravalvar pulmonary stenosis, usually at the takeoff of the right or left pulmonary artery, results in a murmur that is very loud in the axilla and along the distribution of the pulmonary arteries. On the basis of the location of the murmur, the increased apical impulse, and the left ventricular predominance demonstrated on the electrocardiogram I suspect that the murmur resulted from a left-sided rather than a right-sided lesion. Obstruction on the left side can be above, at, or below the aortic valve. Supravalvar aortic obstruction is frequently seen, as I mentioned previously, in Williams' syndrome but may be seen in a sporadic form or a non-Williams'-syndrome autosomal dominant form. As I mentioned, there is inadequate support for the diagnosis of Williams' syndrome. Although the other forms of supravalvar aortic stenosis are possible, they should be associated with a murmur that is louder at the base of the heart with radiation into the carotid arteries and suprasternal notch rather than toward the apex. Valvar aortic stenosis cannot be excluded, but a constant early systolic ejection click is almost always present in children when the obstruction is at the valve level.Subaortic stenosis would best explain the hyperactive apical impulse and the long systolic ejection murmur loudest at the midsternal border with radiation to the right upper sternal border and apex without an ejection click. Several types of subaortic obstruction have been described. The most common in children is a discrete membranous diaphragm or fibrous ring encircling the left-ventricular-outflow tract a few millimeters below the aortic valve. Occasionally, a longer, tunnel-like obstruction of the left-ventricular-outflow tract is seen, and subaortic obstruction in adults is most commonly due to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. It is frequently not possible to differentiate among these three types, but the absence of a family history and of deep septal Q waves in Leads V5 and V6 and left ventricular hypertrophy and strain on the electrocardiogram reduces the probability of a hypertrophic myopathy, which now can be diagnosed, at least in some families, by the detection of mutations in the beta cardiac myosin heavy-chain gene in circulating lymphocytes.[17](#core-r017)The findings in this case are most consistent with discrete membranous subaortic stenosis, which accounts for approximately 10 percent of cases of childhood aortic stenosis.[18](#core-r018) Despite serial examinations at well-child clinics the lesion is rarely detected at birth but has been noted in a fourth of the cases by 5 years and in half the cases by 10 years, suggesting that the obstruction is progressive. In older children aortic regurgitation frequently develops, presumably from damage of the aortic valve by the jet of blood through the membrane. Clinical differentiation from valvar aortic stenosis is difficult since the murmurs are the same, but absence of an ejection click makes subvalvar stenosis the more likely diagnosis. This diagnosis can now be made on two-dimensional echocardiographic examination. The site of obstruction can be visualized, and the gradient can be estimated by Doppler study. I assume that that was the diagnostic procedure performed in this case.Since progression is common, it has been suggested that relief be attempted when the gradient exceeds 30 to 40 mm Hg,[18,19](#core-r018) which may occur in the absence of signs or symptoms of heart disease other than a murmur. Balloon dilation of the lesion has been tried, with some short-term success, but our previous surgical experience, with recurrence unless the collar of obstructing tissue is removed completely, has led us to continue to use the more traditional method of therapy. I shall not be surprised to learn that a cardiac surgical procedure was necessary before the patient's next urinary tract procedure.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Lang, you took care of this patient. Will you comment on your impressions before the diagnosis?Dr. Peter Lang: I arrived at the same conclusion as Dr. Freed when I saw the patient for his initial cardiac evaluation. The ejection quality of the murmur suggested turbulence caused by an obstructive process. The position of maximal intensity of the murmur at the midsternal border, with radiation to the upper right sternal border and cardiac apex, suggested that it originated in the left-ventricular-outflow tract. Finally, the absence of an ejection click led me to believe that the level of obstruction was more likely to be subvalvar than valvar. Since evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy was not indicated on the electrocardiogram, a mild or moderate degree of left ventricular pressure overload was suspected.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Scully: Dr. King will discuss the diagnostic procedure.Dr. Mary Etta King: The echocardiographic view of the long axis of the left ventricle ([Fig. 1](#f001)) confirms Dr. Freed's diagnosis. Just beneath the aortic valve a discrete linear structure protrudes from the interventricular septum, representing a discrete subaortic membrane. In some of the apical views a slight \"tenting\" of the base of the anterior mitral leaflet is evident, indicating the circumferential extent of the membrane. The aortic annulus is of normal size, and the aortic leaflets are thin and normally mobile. The ascending aorta and aortic arch are of normal caliber with normal flow velocities on Doppler study, excluding aortic coarctation. Color-flow Doppler study shows an acceleration of flow velocities at the level of the subaortic obstruction, and in diastole there is no evidence of aortic insufficiency.The cross-sectional echocardiographic views at the base of the heart confirm the presence of three aortic cusps that open normally and coronary arteries that have a normal origin. The cross-sectional views of the left ventricle demonstrate normal cavity size and normal systolic function and a wall thickness at the upper limit of normal; the mitral-valve leaflets appear normal, with no evidence of insufficiency on color-flow Doppler study. Careful scanning of the interventricular septum at several levels showed no evidence of a ventricular septal defect on either two-dimensional imaging or color-flow Doppler study. Continuous-wave Doppler study ([Fig. 1](#f001)) detected a peak flow velocity of 3.1 meters per second, predicting a peak instantaneous systolic gradient of 38 mm Hg, with a mean gradient of 19 mm Hg.In summary, this child had a discrete subaortic membrane with mild outflow obstruction and without associated aortic-valve dysfunction, mitral anomalies, aortic coarctation, or ventricular septal defect.Dr. Scully: Dr. Fallon, will you tell us about the operative procedure and the pathological findings?Dr. John T. Fallon: At operation the normal-appearing aortic cusps were retracted, revealing a dense subaortic membrane. The membrane was excised. Microscopical examination of the tissue revealed very cellular fibrous tissue ([Fig. 2](#f002)).Dr. King: Why is this tissue inapparent in infancy and appears only later in childhood?Dr. Freed: We have not seen this lesion in neonates. Rosenquist et al.[20](#core-r020) have postulated that an increased separation between the mitral and aortic valves results in abnormal flow patterns that might lead to a proliferation of fibrous tissue. Other observers have suspected a proliferation of persistent embryonic endocardial-cushion tissue.[21](#core-r021) The pathogenic considerations of membranous subaortic stenosis have recently been summarized in an article by Gewillig et al.[22](#core-r022) and the accompanying editorial by Borow and Glagov.[23](#core-r023)Dr. Fallon: A similar disease occurs in Newfoundland dogs in which the outflow tract is normal at the time of birth, but subsequently a discrete subaortic stenosis[21](#core-r021) develops that looks exactly like the human lesion. In these dogs the disease is hereditary and congenital.Dr. Scully: Dr. Freed, what is the natural history of this disease if untreated?Dr. Freed: Most of the children get worse. Before the availability of echocardiographic examination it was difficult to distinguish patients with subaortic stenosis from those in whom the obstruction was valvar. In one series 76 percent of the patients had an increase in the gradient of 20 mm Hg or more over a five-year period.[24](#core-r024) The conventional approach has been to interrupt the natural history by operating when the gradient exceeds 35 mm Hg. Recently, however, analysis of our data has indicated a high frequency of recurrence, so that excision of the membrane is often not curative.Dr. Lang: This child's left-ventricular-outflow tract appeared to be free of obstruction during the early postoperative months. He continues to have no cardiovascular symptoms. However, a recent echocardiographic examination has shown recurrent tissue along the interventricular septum that was not present immediately after the surgical procedure, indicating that it has not been curative. The operation was intended to provide some degree of prophylaxis against the development of substantial left ventricular hypertension and to limit the damage to the aortic valve associated with turbulent flow. These ends have been achieved, but the left-ventricular-outflow tract is not now normal and additional treatment may be required.Dr. James M. Perrin: Will you comment on any exercise restrictions that you would recommend for this patient and for patients with this form of aortic stenosis?Dr. Freed: I have great difficulty in evaluating exercise tolerance in three-year-old children because of the wide variation among normal children and the great difficulty in obtaining objective data about a child's tolerance. With a gradient of 38 mm Hg, it is unlikely that any decrease in exercise tolerance could be demonstrated objectively. With this severity of aortic stenosis there are no good data on whether one should restrict activities, and it would be very difficult to limit the activities in a three-year-old even if a limitation were indicated. One can discourage very strenuous, competitive, isometric, or endurance activities of older children, with limited success.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Anna Kagan\n(Department of Medicine): A 34-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of cough, dyspnea, and cavitary lung lesions. Over a period of several days three months before admission, the patient began to have progressive dyspnea, a nonproductive cough, chills, and night sweats. He went to the emergency department of another hospital, where chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) revealed micronodular lesions throughout both lungs, predominantly in the right middle and both lower lobes. Video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge biopsy of the right lung was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens disclosed a nodular angiocentric lymphohistiocytic infiltrate; no granulomas, necrosis or malignant tumor cells were seen. The patient received prednisone (60 mg daily) for a presumptive diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia. The dyspnea improved, and he was discharged on the 10th hospital day. His cough persisted; three weeks later, dyspnea and fever (temperature of up to 39.4\u00b0C) developed and persisted for seven days; the patient saw his primary care physician and was readmitted to the hospital where he had previously been evaluated.\nRadiography and CT of the chest revealed an increase in the size of the nodules in both lungs and new cavitary lesions in the right lower and right middle lobes. The results of laboratory tests are shown in\nTable 1\n. A CT angiogram obtained on the fourth hospital day showed no sign of a pulmonary embolism. Treatment with levofloxacin was begun and the dose of prednisone was slowly tapered, but the patient's symptoms and fever persisted. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was noted to be less alert. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain disclosed multiple foci in the periventricular and subcortical white matter that were hyperintense on T\n2\n-weighted images, with preservation of gray\u2013white differentiation. There was no intraaxial or extraaxial collection of fluid, mass effect, or midline shift. On the sixth hospital day, a CT-guided core needle biopsy of the lesion in the right lower lobe of the lung was performed. On the 10th hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital.\nEight months before admission, the patient had been seen in the emergency department of another hospital because of an episode of palpitations and chest pain, which resolved spontaneously. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed at that time was normal. He had no rash, chest or abdominal pain, urinary or bowel symptoms, headache, joint symptoms, or weight loss. He was congenitally deaf and mute and communicated through sign language. He had borderline hypertension for which he was receiving no treatment. There was no family history of deafness or renal, pulmonary, rheumatologic, or neoplastic diseases. He lived in an urban apartment with his girlfriend. He owned a cat. He had no known toxic or environmental exposures except for a remote history of tobacco use. Before this illness, he had been taking no medications. He had not recently traveled outside the Boston area.\nThe temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the pulse 112 beats per minute, the blood pressure 97/59 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 percent while the patient was breathing 3 liters of oxygen per minute through a nasal cannula. The physical examination was notable only for scattered wheezes and loud rhonchi most predominantly in the right mid-lung and lower lung fields. The results of initial laboratory tests are shown in\nTable 1\n. CT of the chest showed multiple nodules and masses of various sizes in both lungs \u2014 some of which were cavitating \u2014 and a confluent area of consolidation, 10.7 by 6.1 cm, in the right lower lobe; there was a small, right-sided pleural effusion. CT of the abdomen showed enlarged kidneys with low-density lesions throughout the kidneys consistent with cysts. MRI of the head showed extensive periventricular and subcortical white-matter foci that were hyperintense on T\n2\n-weighted images. A diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Ephraim P. Hochberg:* This 34-year-old previously healthy man who had not recently traveled presented with the relatively rapid onset of dyspnea, cough, night sweats, and fevers, followed by the development of bilateral pulmonary nodules. A presumptive diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia had been made, but his symptoms and radiologic abnormalities progressed while he was receiving corticosteroid therapy. MRI of the brain revealed multiple foci that were hyperintense on T2-weighted images. I am aware of the diagnosis in this case, because I served as his attending physician; the case provides an opportunity to discuss the differential diagnosis and management of fever and cavitary infiltrates.May we review the imaging studies?*Dr. Matthew D. Gilman:* Images from the CT of the chest obtained on his admission to this hospital show multiple nodules in both lungs, some of which are cavitary; an area of consolidation in the right lower lobe; and a small, right-sided pleural effusion ([Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C](#f01)). There is no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The abdominal CT showed enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts. There was no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and the spleen and liver were normal. MRI of the brain showed multiple nonenhancing foci of T2-weighted hyperintensity in the subcortical and periventricular white matter. The differential diagnosis for these foci includes early small-vessel ischemic disease, a demyelinating disease, vasculitis, Lyme disease, or a nonenhancing lymphoma.*Dr. Hochberg:* When I saw this patient at the time of his transfer to this hospital, the differential diagnosis of his presenting findings included infectious, rheumatologic, and neoplastic diseases. The findings on the initial wedge biopsy and the possible involvement of the central nervous system narrowed the differential diagnosis. Bilateral basilar pulmonary nodules with a lymphoid component are unlikely to represent infection, and they point mainly toward rheumatologic and malignant diseases.\n### Rheumatologic and Inflammatory Diseases\n\nIn a patient with multiple lung lesions, Wegener's granulomatosis, which is a systemic vasculitis that primarily involves the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the kidneys, should be considered. Four clinical criteria are used in the diagnosis: nasal or oral inflammation; chest radiographs showing nodules, fixed infiltrates, or cavities; abnormal urinary sediment, usually microscopic hematuria; and granulomatous inflammation involving small arteries evident on biopsy of affected tissues. The absence of upper-airway findings and glomerulonephritis, as well as the negative test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies,[1](#core-r001) makes the classic form of Wegener's granulomatosis an unlikely diagnosis in this case. The absence of upper-airway findings and renal disease in this patient could suggest the presence of limited Wegener's granulomatosis, in which the disease is confined to the lungs. Two additional factors suggest that the limited form is also an unlikely diagnosis: limited Wegener's granulomatosis has never been reported to involve the central nervous system, and it has a female predominance. The presence of a dense lymphocytic infiltrate in the lung without necrosis also makes the diagnosis less probable.A patient may present with sarcoidosis in a cavitating nodular form, known as necrotizing sarcoidal granulomatosis; this disease can involve the central nervous system, but the low level of angiotensin-converting enzyme and the absence of granulomas and giant cells in the biopsy specimen effectively rule out sarcoidosis.On the basis of the combination of clinical features and the findings on the initial lung biopsy, a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia was made on the patient's first admission to the other hospital, and corticosteroids were administered. Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia is a clinical syndrome of low-grade fever, cough, progressive dyspnea, and radiologic findings of bilateral, diffuse alveolar opacities.[2](#core-r002) Histologically, it is characterized by the proliferation of granulation tissue within small airways and inflammation in the surrounding alveoli. There are rare reports of the nodular form of the disease; however, the nodule is usually solitary.[3\u20135](#core-r003) The absence of airway involvement in this case, the presence of the cavitary nodules on CT, the radiologic evidence of central nervous system disease, and the lack of response to corticosteroids all make this diagnosis unlikely.\n### Malignant Diseases\n\nThe rapid onset of the nodules and their bilateral distribution, especially in the lung bases, where perfusion is better than in the upper lobes, suggests the hematogenous spread of malignant tumor cells. Germ-cell tumors often involve the lungs and brain and are common in young men such as this patient, but there is no mediastinal, retroperitoneal, or testicular mass, and the histologic features of the biopsy specimen argue against this diagnosis. The elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase and the mixed cellular infiltrate suggest a lymphoid proliferation. Hodgkin's disease can involve the pulmonary parenchyma but almost always spreads by direct extension from contiguous nodal chains. The absence of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy on CT of the chest makes Hodgkin's disease very unlikely. Involvement of the central nervous system by Hodgkin's disease is also extremely rare and is usually manifested as mass lesions.Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas can present as pulmonary parenchymal lesions without mediastinal involvement. Extranodal, marginal-zone B-cell lymphomas, also known as low-grade B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, make up more than 75 percent of primary pulmonary lymphomas.[6,7](#core-r006) The presence of a lymphocytic infiltrate on the lung-biopsy specimen would be consistent with this diagnosis. However, these lymphomas are indolent, rarely cavitate, and hardly ever involve the central nervous system.Diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas, which make up 10 percent of cases of primary pulmonary lymphomas, typically occur as a solitary lesion except in cases of advanced infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), in which bilateral cavitating nodules have been reported.[8](#core-r008) Involvement of the central nervous system occurs in approximately 5 percent of all cases of diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas but may be more common in patients with extranodal disease.[9](#core-r009) Histologically, even small biopsy specimens can be diagnostic. The absence of sheets of large lymphoid cells on the biopsy specimen makes this an unlikely diagnosis in this case.Lymphomatoid granulomatosis, a B-cell neoplasm associated with the Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) that has a predilection for pulmonary involvement, could explain the findings in this case.[10](#core-r010) A patient with this disease often presents with signs and symptoms that suggest infection and may have multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules and involvement of the central nervous system, kidneys, or both. The disease generally occurs in patients in their 40s and has a strong male predominance. Imaging studies usually reveal multiple nodules involving the lower lobes of both lungs, with cavitation in up to 25 percent of cases.[11](#core-r011) Several reports have described spontaneous regression of a subgroup of the nodules, with growth of other nodules in different sites.[12](#core-r012)Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is thought to arise from EBV-immortalized B cells that have escaped immune surveillance. An increased frequency of the disease is associated with both congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies, such as those related to the X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome and Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome and to infection with HIV and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in which T-cell surveillance is deficient.[13](#core-r013) One case of lymphomatoid granulomatosis that developed after the administration of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell rescue for plasma-cell myeloma has been described.[14](#core-r014) Even in patients who do not have a known immunodeficiency disorder, testing of the immune system may reveal abnormalities.[15](#core-r015)This patient had no known history of a congenital or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. He had congenital deafness, and abnormal, multicystic kidneys were detected on CT. An association between ear and kidney abnormalities is well known, but the features of this patient's illness do not seem to fall into any of the recognized syndromes, and none of these are associated with abnormalities of the immune system.[16](#core-r016) Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency and X-linked agammaglobulinemia have both been reported to be associated with sensorineural deafness,[17,18](#core-r017) but this patient had no signs of either disorder. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, the most likely cause of his renal abnormalities, is not associated with immune deficiency.In this patient, the combination of bilateral, basilar pulmonary nodules and cavitation, together with the lymphohistiocytic infiltrate seen on the first biopsy specimen, suggested a diagnosis of lymphomatoid granulomatosis. The diagnostic procedure was a review of the pathological specimens from the other hospital, with specific attention given to the possibility of lymphomatoid granulomatosis.While awaiting this review, I ordered a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test for EBV DNA in a peripheral-blood sample from the patient. EBV DNA is highly elevated in only very few diseases, including infectious mononucleosis, nasopharyngeal cancer, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, some cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease. Peripheral-blood levels of EBV DNA have not previously been studied in lymphomatoid granulomatosis. The EBV load in the peripheral blood of this patient was elevated, at 73,000 copies per milliliter.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Robert P. Hasserjian:* The diagnostic procedure was a review of the two biopsy specimens of the right lung. The first biopsy specimen, obtained three months before the patient's admission to this hospital, was obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopy at two sites in the right lower lobe. Multiple angiocentric nodular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates were present, with invasion of blood-vessel walls ([Figure 2A and 2B](#f02)). The infiltrate consisted predominantly of small lymphocytes with admixed histiocytes and occasional large, atypical lymphoid cells. Neither necrosis nor granulomas were identified. On immunohistochemical staining, most of the small lymphoid cells were CD3+ T cells, with only scattered CD20+ small B cells ([Figure 2A](#f02), inset, upper right). In situ hybridization with the use of a probe to EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) was positive in a very few small cells ([Figure 2A](#f02), inset, lower right). An acid-fast stain for mycobacteria and a silver stain for fungi were negative.The second biopsy specimen, which was obtained four days before admission to this hospital, was a CT-guided core needle biopsy of the right lung. Examination of this specimen revealed an extensively necrotic angiocentric lymphohistiocytic infiltrate ([Figure 2C](#f02)). In contrast to the first specimen, this specimen had numerous CD20+ large B cells ([Figure 2C](#f02), inset, upper right) and many EBER-positive large cells, as demonstrated with the use of in situ hybridization ([Figure 2C](#f02), inset, lower right).These findings are typical of lymphomatoid granulomatosis, an extranodal lymphoproliferative disorder originally described by Liebow et al. in 1972.[10](#core-r010) The pathological hallmarks are a mixed infiltrate of small lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, and variable numbers of large, atypical lymphoid cells, which surround and often infiltrate and obliterate blood vessels of various sizes (angiocentric and angiodestructive infiltrates).[19](#core-r019) The pathological differential diagnosis includes benign angiocentric lymphohistiocytic processes (mycobacterial or fungal infections, necrotizing sarcoidosis, and Wegener's granulomatosis); however, in contrast to these other entities, true granulomas are not usually present in lymphomatoid granulomatosis.Our understanding of the pathogenesis of lymphomatoid granulomatosis has evolved since its first description, when it was unclear whether it was neoplastic or inflammatory in nature. The predominant T-cell population led to its initial misclassification as a type of T-cell lymphoma.[20](#core-r020) However, further studies demonstrated clonal EBV sequences in the infiltrates of lymphomatoid granulomatosis[21](#core-r021) and the localization of these EBV sequences to B cells, rather than to T cells.[22\u201325](#core-r022) Many of the T cells in lymphomatoid granulomatosis are cytotoxic T cells[26](#core-r026) that are recruited and activated by the interferon-\u03b3\u2013induced cytokines monokine induced by interferon \u03b3 (MIG) and interferon-inducible protein of 10 kD (IP-10).[27](#core-r027) The infarct-like necrosis seen in the disorder appears to be due both to vascular occlusion by the lymphoid infiltrate and to fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessels mediated by EBV-induced chemokines. The association between lymphomatoid granulomatosis and immunosuppression implicates abnormal immune-system regulation in the context of an expanding EBV-infected B-cell population ([Figure 3](#f03)).[22](#core-r022)The number of large EBV-positive neoplastic B cells varies among cases and is correlated with the prognosis. The disorder is thus graded on the basis of the number of large B cells and the extent of the necrosis. In this patient, the first specimen represents grade 1 of three possible grades, whereas the second specimen, with necrosis and more frequent large B cells, would be classified as grade 2 to 3. In the World Health Organization system of classification of hematologic malignant diseases, low-grade lymphomatoid granulomatosis (grades 1 and 2) is considered to be a B-cell proliferation of uncertain malignant potential, since some cases may regress spontaneously or in response to interferon alfa-2b therapy; grade 3 is considered to be a variant of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.[13](#core-r013)\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Hochberg:* The natural history of lymphomatoid granulomatosis is highly variable. Up to 27 percent of patients may have complete remission without therapy[19](#core-r019); however, the majority of patients follow a progressive course with a median survival of only 14 months. Early retrospective reviews were unable to demonstrate any benefit from corticosteroid therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or radiation, as compared with observation alone.[11,19](#core-r011) Despite this, corticosteroids are often a mainstay of therapy. A small, prospective clinical trial conducted in 1982 reported a rate of response of 47 percent with the use of oral cyclophosphamide and oral prednisone, with a mean duration of response of 5.2 years.[28](#core-r028)After lymphomatoid granulomatosis was determined to be an EBV-associated lymphoma, interferon alfa-2b was used in a small clinical trial.[15](#core-r015) All four patients in the trial had a response (three had a complete response, and one had a partial response); the patient with a partial response discontinued interferon and subsequently died of the disease. A larger clinical trial of this therapy has been reported in abstract form as having a rate of response of 67 percent of patients (8 of 12) with grade 1 or 2 lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Aggressive combination chemotherapy has been reported to be effective in grade 3 disease.[15,20](#core-r015) Recently, several case reports of the efficacy of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the B-cell surface molecule CD20, in treating this disease have been published.[29\u201334](#core-r029) Patients who die of the disease typically have progression to grade 3, or diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.This patient was discharged from the hospital on the second day, pending review of the pathological specimens from the other hospital. Two weeks after his discharge, the dyspnea worsened and a chest radiograph revealed a new right-sided pneumothorax. A chest tube was placed, and the patient was readmitted to the hospital. On the same day, the diagnosis of lymphomatoid granulomatosis was confirmed. Cultures of induced sputum and fluid from the chest tube revealed a polymicrobial infection with two strains of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa,* along with three other types of gram-negative rods. Testing for evidence of infection with HIV and hepatitis B and C virus was negative.Given the patient's active infection, I did not consider myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Weekly rituximab (375 mg per square meter of body-surface area given once weekly) was initiated on the second day of his second hospitalization. Defervescence occurred, and the chest tube was removed. CT performed after the administration of the second dose of rituximab revealed resolution of a nodule, previously 2 cm in diameter, in the right upper lobe, but there was progressive cavitation of the large necrotic mass in the right lower lobe. A bronchopleural fistula developed, requiring the placement of another chest tube, and progressive respiratory distress necessitated intubation. He died on the 18th hospital day. An autopsy was performed.*Dr. Hasserjian:* At autopsy, the lungs were markedly enlarged, with numerous, firm, tan-to-white nodules involving 80 percent of the parenchyma of both lungs ([Figure 4A](#f04)). Several nodules in the right lung were cavitating, and a bronchopleural fistula was present. Histologic examination revealed sheets of large B cells with areas of necrosis and persistent angioinvasion ([Figure 4B](#f04)). Nearly all the large cells were positive for CD20 ([Figure 4B](#f04), inset, upper right) and EBER ([Figure 4B](#f04), inset, lower right). These features indicate progression to grade 3 lymphomatoid granulomatosis, the equivalent of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. Although it is possible that an unsampled higher-grade lesion was also present at the time of the initial biopsy, the striking increase in EBER-positive cells between the first biopsy and the autopsy suggests evolution of the disease due to rapid clonal expansion of the neoplastic EBV-infected B-cell population. Both kidneys had multiple large cysts consistent with the presence of adult-type polycystic kidney disease. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis was not identified outside the lungs; in particular, the brain showed diffuse neuronal injury consistent with ischemia but no lymphoma or angiodestructive infiltrates.*Dr. Hochberg:* The autopsy findings do not explain the areas of hyperintense signal seen on the MRI T2-weighted images. Rituximab crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier poorly, achieving about 0.5 percent of the systemic levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, there is one case report of a response of lymphomatoid granulomatosis of the central nervous system to rituximab.[30](#core-r030) This report raises the possibility that this patient might have had involvement of the central nervous system by lymphomatoid granulomatosis that responded to the administration of rituximab. Another piece of evidence supporting this interpretation is the resolution of the lung nodule in the right upper lobe with rituximab therapy.\n",

      "question": "Dr. R. Scott Harris:\nA 60-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of increasing dyspnea.\nThe patient had been well until 2 years before the current evaluation, when episodes of mild, nonproductive coughing developed and occurred multiple times daily. Between 13 months and 10 months before the current evaluation, three febrile illnesses occurred, with temperatures up to 38.9\u00b0C. After the third illness, the patient noted dyspnea with exertion. She was seen by her physician for an outpatient evaluation; a chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Oral azithromycin and combined inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol fumarate dihydrate were administered.\nSixteen days after the outpatient evaluation, dyspnea worsened and was associated with fevers and chest congestion. On evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital, a chest radiograph reportedly showed pulmonary findings suggestive of possible scarring or consolidation; levofloxacin was administered. Ten days later, computed tomography (CT), performed according to a pulmonary emboli protocol, was reportedly negative. An echocardiogram reportedly showed normal left ventricular function and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.\nSeven months before this evaluation, results of pulmonary-function tests were thought to be consistent with obstructive lung disease (\nTable 1\n). The level of \u03b1\n1\n-antitrypsin was normal. During the next 4 months, the patient noted increased dyspnea while she was climbing stairs and walking fast. Approximately 4.5 months before this evaluation, pulmonary-function tests were repeated (\nTable 1\n). Additional testing revealed allergies to shellfish, dust mites, oak, and birch.\nTwenty-seven days before this evaluation, the patient returned to her physician\u2019s office because of increasing dyspnea; albuterol (by nebulizer) and prednisone were administered. One week later, on examination by a pulmonologist at another clinic, the blood pressure was 147/96 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while she was breathing ambient air at rest; the remainder of the examination was normal. Thirteen days before this evaluation, pulmonary-function tests were performed. The results are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nDr. John W. Nance:\nCT of the chest, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild cylindrical bronchiectasis predominantly in the left lower lobe (involving the basilar segments of both lower lobes, the right middle lobe, and the inferior lingular segment), with accompanying mild, diffuse bronchial-wall thickening. There was a small focus of atelectasis or scarring in the medial segment of the right middle lobe, but the lungs otherwise showed no focal abnormality. There was a small hiatal hernia.\nDr. Harris:\nThe patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, she reported increasing dyspnea and fatigue with mild exertion during the previous 3 months that had required rest after she walked one block or climbed one flight of stairs, as well as increasing frequency of upper-airway tightness and, for 4 days before this presentation, a productive cough with green sputum. She also had had fevers and weight loss of 2.5 kg during the previous month. She had hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, hypertensive disorder, recurrent urinary tract infections, and lichen sclerosus, and she had undergone a total knee replacement. She had smoked one to two packs of cigarettes weekly for 10 years as a young adult. Medications were amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, montelukast, a multivitamin, and vitamin C (orally); albuterol and budesonide\u2013formoterol (by inhalation); betamethasone dipropionate ointment, clobetasol propionate ointment, and estradiol vaginal cream (by topical application); cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion; and fluticasone furoate nasal spray. She had no known allergies to medications. She was married and had two adult children and two dogs. She was a manager in a medical field and reported no known home or occupational exposures. She lived in a suburban area and had traveled to Europe several months earlier. Her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, her sister had the left ventricular noncompaction syndrome, and her children were healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 132/63 mm Hg, the pulse 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.9. The lungs were clear, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in\nTable 1\n. The hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, IgA, IgM, IgE, and \u03b1\n1\n-antitrypsin were normal, as were results of testing for rheumatoid factor, tests of renal and liver function, and serum protein electrophoresis. Testing was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies and antigen, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase, Scl-70, Jo, Ro, La,\nAspergillus fumigatus, A. pullulans, A. flavus, Thermoactinomyces sacchari, T. candidus, T. vulgaris, Micropolyspora faeni,\nand pigeon sera. Other test results are shown in\nTable 2\n.\nDr. Nance:\nCT of the chest was performed (\nFigure 1\n), after the intravenous administration of contrast material, according to an interstitial lung disease protocol (which includes high-resolution scans obtained during inspiration and expiration and with the patient in the prone position). The scans showed mild cylindrical bronchiectasis predominantly in the lower lobes and mild, diffuse bronchial-wall thickening. There was no difference in the attenuation of the lung parenchyma on expiratory images, as compared with inspiratory images; this finding is suggestive of air trapping. On the expiratory images, there was no lobular or geographic heterogeneity in lung attenuation, a finding indicative of a diffuse process.\nDr. Harris:\nEight days after the evaluation in the pulmonary clinic, a bronchoscopic examination was performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the right middle lobe and lingula revealed clear and colorless fluid, with three nucleated cells per microliter (34% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 6% eosinophils, and 32% macrophages or lining cells) and no evidence of pepsin A or galactomannan antigen. Cytologic examination revealed no viral cytopathic changes, fungal elements, or malignant cells. Gram\u2019s staining revealed very few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, and cultures were negative for bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. Flow cytometry revealed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population.\nDuring the 11 days after the bronchoscopic examination, increased dyspnea occurred, with associated intermittent low-grade fevers. Test results are shown in\nTable 2\n. A chest radiograph showed a patchy right basilar opacity suggestive of atelectasis or aspiration. Albuterol (by nebulizer or by inhaler with a spacer) and a course of azithromycin were administered, and the patient\u2019s condition eventually returned to baseline.\nThirty-four days after the evaluation in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital, flexible bronchoscopic examination revealed prominent scarring between the arytenoids, marked inflammation in the subglottic space, scattered whitish secretions with marked airway inflammation throughout the trachea and right and left bronchial trees, and mild ectasia of the central airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the right and left lungs was submitted for microbiologic and cytologic examination and revealed no evidence of viral or bacterial infection.\nTwo days later, a diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Sydney B. Montesi:* This patient is a 60-year-old woman with no history of pulmonary disease who presented with a nonproductive cough followed by worsening dyspnea. Her condition did not improve with the use of an inhaled glucocorticoid combined with a long-acting beta-agonist. Her oxygen saturation while she was breathing ambient air was abnormal; she had no wheezing or crackles on physical examination. CT of the chest revealed diffuse gas trapping, mild bronchial-wall thickening, and mild bronchiectasis. Results of pulmonary-function testing included a progressive, severe obstructive ventilatory defect, increasing hyperinflation, and worsening diffusion impairment. On the basis of the patient\u2019s presentation, our differential diagnosis should include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis.\n### Asthma\n\nAsthma is a common respiratory condition. Patients typically present with cough, wheezing, and chest tightness, and pulmonary-function testing reveals reversible airflow obstruction, although in some cases, a nonreversible obstructive defect may develop. This patient\u2019s symptoms were progressive, despite treatment with an inhaled glucocorticoid and a long-acting beta-agonist, montelukast, and several courses of oral prednisone; because these standard treatments for asthma were ineffective, severe refractory asthma should be considered. The patient did not have an elevated eosinophil count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which would be suggestive of eosinophilic asthma, a well-recognized cause of refractory asthma.[1,2](#core-r001) In addition, asthma alone should not cause a diffusion impairment.It is important to consider conditions that can mimic asthma, such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as the Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and tracheobronchomalacia. ANCA testing was negative; a negative ANCA test does not rule out eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, but there were no other findings suggestive of this diagnosis. The patient had antibodies to *A. niger*; however, this is not an uncommon finding, and the absence of a coexisting elevated IgE level and of peripheral eosinophilia rules out the possibility of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.[3](#core-r003) Finally, flexible bronchoscopy did not reveal dynamic collapse of the airway, and the absence of this finding rules out the diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia.\n### COPD\n\nCOPD is primarily a smoking-related disease that results in airflow obstruction. Similar to patients with asthma, those with COPD may present with symptoms of cough, wheezing, and dyspnea; however, the airflow obstruction is generally nonreversible. Unlike patients with asthma, patients with COPD, especially those with coexisting emphysema, commonly have diffusion impairment. Some patients have an overlapping syndrome that involves features of both asthma and COPD. Pulmonary-function testing is needed to both establish the diagnosis and determine disease severity.Although this patient was a former smoker, her smoking history was remote and less than 5 pack-years and, for these reasons, should not be the cause of severe COPD. She had had no exposure to poorly vented products of biofuel combustion, an important cause of COPD in certain parts of the world.[4](#core-r004) A small fraction of patients have COPD due to \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency,[5,6](#core-r005) an autosomal, codominant, progressive disease that is associated with panacinar emphysema that occurs predominantly in the lower lobes. The patient\u2019s \u03b11-antitrypsin level was normal, and CT of the chest revealed no evidence of emphysema; these findings essentially rule out this diagnosis.\n### Bronchiectasis\n\nBronchiectasis is characterized by abnormal dilatation of the airways due to airway scarring. Bronchiectasis most often results from a previous pulmonary infection but is also associated with several disease processes, including immunodeficiencies, cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesia, and connective-tissue diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis.[7](#core-r007) Bronchiectasis can also result from recurrent aspiration. In addition, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis can cause both bronchiectasis and asthma, and \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency can cause both bronchiectasis and COPD. The clinical course of bronchiectasis includes a productive cough marked by periods of exacerbation. With time, patients with clinically significant bronchiectasis become colonized by gram-negative organisms. This patient had no history of recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Results of immunoglobulin testing were normal, aside from a mild decrease in the IgG1 level. Serologic testing for rheumatoid arthritis was negative. Although the patient had bronchiectasis on imaging studies of the chest, it was mild. In addition, bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, and fungal cultures of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative for all organisms. Thus, we can rule out a primary diagnosis of bronchiectasis.\n### Bronchiolitis\n\nBronchiolitis is a disease of the small airways, which are defined as airways less than 2 mm in diameter and without cartilage. The bronchioles are especially vulnerable to infectious or inhalational insults because of their small diameter. The primary symptoms of bronchiolitis are cough and dyspnea. Pulmonary-function testing reveals a nonreversible obstructive ventilatory defect and hyperinflation and often reveals diffusion impairment. Results of chest radiography may be normal. High-resolution CT of the chest is the imaging study of choice, and characteristic findings include areas of gas trapping, bronchial-wall thickening, and centrilobular nodules. Bronchiolitis may occur as a distinct clinical entity, such as acute bronchiolitis or obliterative bronchiolitis (also known as constrictive bronchiolitis), or as part of an interstitial lung disease with bronchiolar involvement, such as respiratory bronchiolitis\u2013associated interstitial lung disease.Acute bronchiolitis is infectious in origin and often caused by respiratory syncytial virus, although it can be seen with influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and mycoplasma. Acute bronchiolitis primarily occurs in children but can occur in adults and is most often self-limiting. Diffuse panbronchiolitis primarily affects middle-aged Japanese men, causing a progressive disease that leads to bronchiectasis, to recurrent infections, and often to sinusitis.[8](#core-r008) Respiratory bronchiolitis is primarily seen in smokers and most often detected as an incidental finding on pathological examination of the lungs.[9](#core-r009) Patients with dyspnea and radiographic abnormalities of centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobe have respiratory bronchiolitis\u2013associated interstitial lung disease. Follicular bronchiolitis is also characterized by centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacities on imaging studies of the chest and is associated with connective-tissue diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome) and immunodeficiency syndromes (e.g., HIV infection and common variable immunodeficiency [CVID]).[10\u201313](#core-r010) Microbiologic analysis of two different specimens of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from this patient was negative for viral, bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms. Although this patient had evidence of a progressive bronchiolitis, her demographic features were not consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse panbronchiolitis. She did not have findings on imaging studies that were suggestive of either respiratory bronchiolitis\u2013associated interstitial lung disease or a follicular bronchiolitis, and testing did not reveal any conditions associated with follicular bronchiolitis.Granulomatous bronchiolitis is a condition that can be seen with inflammatory bowel diseases with pulmonary involvement, interstitial lung diseases (e.g., hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, and granulomatous\u2013lymphocytic interstitial lung disease), and infectious causes (e.g., tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria).[14,15](#core-r014) Although this patient had antibodies to *A. niger* and *Saccharomonospora viridis,* their presence is neither sensitive nor specific for a diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Sarcoidosis can cause myriad radiographic abnormalities of the chest, but the patient did not have hilar lymphadenopathy, the most common finding of pulmonary sarcoidosis.It is important to consider two other interstitial lung diseases that can affect the bronchioles: cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (formerly known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia) and airway-centered interstitial fibrosis. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is one of seven idiopathic interstitial pneumonias and results from injury to the alveolar epithelium, although the bronchioles are usually involved because of their close proximity. This patient\u2019s high-resolution CT scan did not show patchy areas of nodules, consolidations, or ground-glass opacities, and the absence of these findings rules out this diagnosis. Airway-centered interstitial fibrosis is an entity that has been recognized relatively recently and mostly affects women 40 to 60 years of age.[16,17](#core-r016) The disease is progressive and results in death within 4 years in approximately one third of patients.[17](#core-r017) Unlike obliterative bronchiolitis, which can also have a progressive course of worsening dyspnea, airway-centered interstitial fibrosis results in a restrictive ventilatory defect and a characteristic radiographic abnormality of peribronchovascular opacities[17](#core-r017); this patient had neither of these features.Finally, obliterative bronchiolitis is a condition in which the airway lumen of the bronchioles becomes narrowed. Patients present with cough, dyspnea, and nonreversible airway obstruction. Obliterative bronchiolitis is progressive and can result in respiratory failure, because the bronchioles may ultimately become obliterated. As this disease advances, both bronchiectasis and diffusion abnormalities may develop. High-resolution CT reveals mosaic attenuation (i.e., areas of differing attenuation) and gas trapping. Unlike several other conditions that affect the bronchioles, obliterative bronchiolitis does not cause centrilobular nodules. The disease is rarely postinfectious. It has been described in conjunction with exposure to certain medications, including penicillamine and gold, and exposure to certain toxins, such as sulfur dioxide, sulfur mustard, nitrogen oxides, and the food flavoring diacetyl.[18\u201323](#core-r018) The bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome refers to obliterative bronchiolitis that occurs during the post-transplantation period, specifically after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and lung transplantation.[24,25](#core-r024) Like many of the other types of bronchiolitis, obliterative bronchiolitis can be seen in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and connective-tissue diseases; on rare occasions, it is idiopathic.[26](#core-r026) This patient had no known exposures to toxins or risk factors for the development of obliterative bronchiolitis. It is important to note that, in some patients, the development of connective-tissue disease\u2013associated lung disease can precede the development of the connective-tissue disease itself. This patient had a negative rheumatoid factor and negative testing for CCP antibodies, whereas positive results would be suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis, the connective-tissue disease most frequently associated with bronchiolitis. However, it remains possible that rheumatoid arthritis or another connective-tissue disease could develop with time.[27,28](#core-r027)In conclusion, this patient\u2019s progressive dyspnea, worsening obstruction (measured by means of pulmonary-function testing), marked hyperinflation, and diffuse gas trapping are highly suggestive of a bronchiolitis. I believe her clinical presentation is most consistent with an obliterative bronchiolitis of unknown cause. I suspect the diagnostic test was video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, since histopathological examination of lung tissue would be needed to confirm the diagnosis.*Dr. Eric S. Rosenberg* (Pathology): Dr. Harris, what was your clinical impression when you initially evaluated this patient?*Dr. Harris:* The patient\u2019s history of chronic shortness of breath and cough, the absence of wheezing, the irreversible severe obstruction and hyperinflation at a residual volume on pulmonary-function testing, and the absence of an infiltrate on high-resolution CT suggested an airway disease other than asthma. The absence of a clinically significant smoking history, the normal \u03b11-antitrypsin level, and the absence of evidence of emphysema on high-resolution CT made emphysema unlikely. I favored a diagnosis of obliterative bronchiolitis, despite the absence of exposure to inhaled substances that are known to be associated with this entity. Chronic obstructive asthma, a type of asthma that is thought to result in airway remodeling and irreversible obstruction, was also a possibility. In order to establish the diagnosis of obliterative bronchiolitis, the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and biopsy of the right lung.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Eugene J. Mark:* The diagnostic procedure was a wedge biopsy of the right lung. Four specimens were obtained; the largest was approximately 3 cm by 2 cm by 0.5 cm. On histopathological examination, the most prominent finding at low magnification was an apparent absence of bronchioles in most of the specimens ([Figure 2A and 2B](#f02)). At higher magnification, respiratory bronchioles were encircled by collars of dense fibrosis and fibrous and elastotic scarring, with virtual obliteration of the lumen ([Figure 2C and 2D](#f02)). Bronchioles located where the section was cut longitudinally showed that the linear scars lay along the bronchioles ([Figure 2E](#f02)). Occasionally, the lumen was entirely obliterated by histiocytic inflammation ([Figure 2F](#f02)). Taken together, these findings are consistent with a diagnosis of obliterative bronchiolitis with fibrosis.Various forms of bronchiolitis can be identified pathologically, including occlusive and constrictive forms.[29\u201332](#core-r029) The occlusion can be identified by an intraluminal tuft of inflammation and fibrosis, sometimes referred to as a Masson body. At other times, the scarring replaces the wall of the bronchiole and constricts the lumen. This patient had both forms of bronchiolitis, but the constrictive form was unusual and dramatic.\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Harris:* After the procedure, the patient had a complicated postoperative course that included severe shortness of breath and wheezing, which were thought to be due to aspiration. Her condition improved after the administration of high-dose methylprednisolone. Her medications were eventually adjusted to 10 mg of prednisone daily, inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol, tiotropium, and montelukast. However, her cough returned, and the dosage of prednisone was increased to 20 mg daily; she had some symptom relief. At this point, we added pirfenidone and azithromycin, on the basis of post-transplantation literature, which indicates that FAM (inhaled fluticasone, azithromycin, and montelukast) therapy has been used for post-transplantation obliterative bronchiolitis. Despite these additional therapies, the patient\u2019s condition continued to slowly worsen, both symptomatically and, eventually, with respect to the results of pulmonary-function testing. She was referred for consideration of lung transplantation, but during the cardiac evaluation, she was found to require a coronary stent and clopidogrel therapy for 6 months.After discontinuation of the clopidogrel, approximately 13 months after the lung biopsy, the patient underwent bilateral lung transplantation. After the transplantation, she remained in the hospital for 19 days and then was discharged home. At her first follow-up visit, she was doing well.*Dr. Rosenberg:* Dr. Mark, what did examination of the explanted lungs reveal?*Dr. Mark:* Both explanted lungs showed central bronchiectasis, peribronchiolar fibrosis to an extensive degree, and luminal obstruction due to inflammation and mucus. The histologic examination revealed results that were similar to those seen on examination of the biopsy specimen. A gross specimen of the explanted lungs showed central bronchiectasis, large regions of hyperinflation, and an absence of bronchioles ([Figure 3](#f03)).\n",

      "question": "A 15-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of a question of a cyst of the right lung.\nThe patient was the second of three normal children born to a mother 21 years of age; the pregnancy was complicated by hyperemesis gravidarum. At the age of two years the patient began to have mild asthma; she was reported to be allergic to dust. During her ninth and tenth years she resided in Florida and was free of wheezing. At the age of 11 years she returned to the metropolitan-Boston area, and wheezing recurred. An x-ray film of the chest was reported to show a pneumatocele in the right middle lobe. The appearance remained unchanged on two subsequent x-ray films.\nSix months before admission the child was referred to this hospital. Physical examination showed diminished breath sounds over the lower half of the right-lung field; the excursion of the right hemidiaphragm was 1 cm, and that of the left 4 cm; no wheezes or rales were heard, and the heart was normal. There was bilateral obstruction of the nares by nasal polyps. Pulmonary-function studies revealed that the first-second forced expiratory volume was 2.8 liters (predicted, 3.2 liters), the vital capacity 2.8 liters (predieted, 3.7 liters), and the peak expiratory flow rate 300 liters per minute (predicted, 420 liters). Fluoroscopic examination and x-ray films of the chest disclosed hyperinflation of the right middle lobe, with evidence of marked air-trapping on a film obtained in expiration; the vasculature was diminished in the right middle lobe, and there was a circumscribed curvilinear branching density within the lobe, with several radiating linear densities extending toward the hilus. A\n13\nN perfusion-ventilation study, performed with the patient supine, demonstrated that 48 per cent of perfusion and 53 per cent of ventilation were distributed to the right lung; both perfusion and ventilation were markedly decreased in its lower half. Six months later the child was admitted to the hospital.\nThere was a history of congenital sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear. Menarche occurred at the age of 13 years, with subsequent regular menses. Her only medication was a mixture of ephedrine sulfate, theophylline, and hydroxyzine hydrochloride. An aunt had asthma; the patient's mother and 16-year-old brother had hay fever. Her father died at 29 years of hypertension and a \"heart attack.\"\nThe temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 80, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 120/60 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared well. The head and neck were normal. The lungs were clear; breath sounds were diminished over the right-lower-lung field, especially anteriorly and laterally. The heart and abdomen were normal. No peripheral edema, clubbing, or cyanosis was observed.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 38.1 per cent, and the white-cell count 7400. An electrocardiogram was normal. X-ray films of the chest (\nFig. 1\n) revealed a large area of bulla formation in the right-lower-lung field laterally, with a contralateral shift of the mediastinum; an irregular curvilinear branching opacity, 1 cm in diameter, was projected within the area of bullous change. On fluoroscopic examination air-trapping was again observed during expiration, with a shift of the mediastinum to the left; the right hemidiaphragm moved normally; the right lower lobe was compressed by the hyperexpanded right middle lobe during expiration; the heart, pulmonary vasculature, mediastinum, hilar regions, and bony thorax appeared normal.\nOn the second hospital day bronchoscopic examination revealed moderate erythema of the trachea, with considerable mucus; the remainder of the tracheobronchial tree appeared normal, and the bronchial orifices were in their usual locations; no extrinsic compression or fistula was observed, and no foreign body was found. Selective right bronchographic examination (\nFig. 2\n) disclosed a normal appearance of the right-upper-lobe bronchus and its branches; the right-lower-lobe bronchus and its superior and anterobasilar segmental branches were structurally normal, but the right lower lobe was compressed along its anterior and lateral aspects. Instillation of contrast material into the right-middle-lobe bronchus showed that the lateral segment of the middle lobe was elevated and slightly compressed from its anterior and inferior aspects. The bronchial branches appeared normal except for a 50 per cent stenosis at their origin from the main middle-lobe bronchus. A long, very tight stenosis was seen at the origin of the bronchus to the medial segment of the middle lobe; a catheter passed through this segment produced opacification of very hypoplastic bronchi in the medial segment of the middle lobe, which was compressed and deviated posteriorly and medially. Approximately a third of the volume of the inferior half of the right hemithorax was filled by a large cystic structure, which contained branching opacities. During the course of the study considerable collapse of the right upper and lower lobes occurred.\nAn operation was performed on the fourth hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Barry L. Fanburg\\*: I should like to begin with a review of the x-ray films.Dr. David C. Kushner: A radiograph obtained four years before admission reveals that the left lung was normal, but the mediastinum is shifted slightly toward the left. A large area of overinflation is seen in the right middle lobe. Within this area there is an unusual branching opacity several centimeters in diameter. A radiograph taken on admission ([Fig. 1](#f001)) confirms the presence of the area of overinflation and the branching opacity directed toward its medial margin. No calcification is visible.An endoscopically guided bronchographic study ([Fig. 2](#f002)) reveals some atelectasis of the right upper lobe, which cleared on radiographs taken after the procedure. The overinflation of the right middle lobe is evident. A small catheter was inserted into the orifice of the right-middle-lobe bronchus via the bronchoscope. The films demonstrate elevation of the lateral-segment bronchus and compression by the overinflated medial segment caudad to it. The orificeand first centimeter of the lateral segment are stenotic. The medial segmental bronchus is filled at its orifice and along its first centimeter. This bronchus tapers sharply and supplies several small, irregular subsegmental bronchi. The area of overinflation within the middle lobe never filled with contrast medium. The branching opacity lies distal to the narrowed medial segmental bronchus. The lower lobe, although compressed by the middle lobe, is intrinsically normal.Dr. Fanburg: The patient apparently had a pneumatocele in the right middle lobe, first demonstrated on an x-ray film of the chest four years ago. The appearance on the recent films is similar except for overall enlargement of the anatomical structures of the chest and the pneumatocele. The relatively similar enlargement with time of both the hyperlucent area and the lung raises an interesting question concerning the direction of growth of lung tissue, but I shall not discuss it at this time. There is no indication that the pneumatocele itself enlarged disproportionately to the lung, and hence it does not seem to have been under increased tension. The lung fields appear normal otherwise, and there is no evidence of other pneumatoceles or bullous changes. A particularly interesting feature of the pneumatocele is the circumscribed density at its center, with linear densities radiating from it. This density was probably fixed in position since it did not drop to the bottom of the pneumatocele when the patient was in the erect position. Its presence may be the most difficult aspect of the diagnostic problem, and I shall return to it later.The patient had had asthma since early childhood. She was found to have bilateral nasal polyps, which for poorly understood reasons occasionally accompany asthma. Pulmonary-function studies revealed impairment in expiratory flow rates, consistent with moderate obstructive airway disease. The right lung remained hyperinflated relative to the left lung with exhalation. This finding is consistent with an air space in the right middle lobe that is not in free communication with expiratory air flow, at least in a single-breath maneuver. I doubt that the asthma was related to the pneumatocele or the associated density. Inspissated secretions associated with asthma generally cause localized atelectasis, not localized hyperinflation of the lung. The congenital sensorineural hearing impairment in the right ear is probably an isolated finding. A conduction defect secondary to otitis media would have been more consistent with nasal polyps and recurrent nasopharyngitis.With that background, I shall return to the pneumatocele. We are dealing with a right-middle-lobe lesion, and for the purpose of discussion at least three entities should be considered. The term right-middle-lobe syndrome[1,2](#core-r001) was coined by Graham and his associates[3](#core-r003) in the late 1940s to describe a lesion that is usually associated with collapse of the right middle lobe. The frequency of this problem in that location is thought to be associated with the anatomical features of the right-middle-lobe bronchus \u2014 i.e., its prolonged tubular structure with a relatively small diameter in relation to the lung substance that it subserves, the relatively acute angle at its takeoff, and the complex of lymph nodes surrounding it. All these factors are thought to lead to an increased likelihood of collapse of the right-middle-lobe bronchus associated with a variety of abnormalities. At times there is confusion with lesions within the lumen of the bronchus, such as an adenoma, another type of tumor, or an aspirated foreign body. In some cases there is a patent bronchus with distal bronchiectasis. The right-middle-lobe syndrome can be caused by a variety of disorders, including tuberculous lymphadenitis, histoplasmosis, and nonspecific lymphadenitis. The hall-mark of the syndrome is collapse of the lobe, but in the literature some patients with a pneumatocele have been included in series of cases of the right-middle-lobe syndrome.A second consideration is the hyperlucent-lung syndrome, which was first described by Swyer and James[4](#core-r004) and refers to a unilateral emphysematous change. At times it does not involve the entire lung and may be confused with a pneumatocele. A distinguishing factor is atresia or absence of the pulmonary artery, which was not demonstrated on the x-ray films of the chest in this case.A third possibility is a bronchial cyst,[5](#core-r005) which is thought to be a congenital abnormality probably related to arrest of maturation of bronchial mucosa. It can occur distally in a bronchus, and the cyst usually contains fluid, although there may be an air-fluid level when the cyst communicates with the airway. That diagnosis can be dismissed in this case.Therefore, I return to the probability that the patient had a pneumatocele associated with bronchial stenosis. The initial x-ray films, the films obtained after exhalation, and the findings from the ventilation-perfusion study all support the diagnosis of a pneumatocele. The bronchographic examination demonstrated stenosis of the branches of the right-middle-lobe bronchus. Although it may have been congenital, I believe that it was acquired in this case for reasons that I shall discuss later. Pneumonia could have destroyed the right middle lobe in the past, leading to the development of a pneumatocele and narrowing of the associated bronchi, but there is no history of pneumonia. The possibility that tuberculosis was the cause of bronchial stenosis should also be considered, but it is often associated with bronchiectasis and does not appear to be relevant to this case. The pneumatocele could have been the result of an intrabronchial lesion, such as an aspirated foreign body or an adenoma, producing a ball-valve effect. I also wondered about a papilloma or possibly even a neurofibroma, which could be associated with an eighth-nerve neurofibroma causing sensorineural hearing loss. It seems probable, however, that any of these lesions within a bronchus would have been seen on the bronchoscopic examination. Hence, I return to the probability that the lesion was a pneumatocele associated with bronchial stenosis caused by scarring or inspissation of mucus. The obstruction probably led to the pneumatocele by producing a ball-valve effect.I next come to the opacity in the center of the pneumatocele. If it was an adenoma, a papilloma, or an aspirated foreign body it probably would have occluded the airway, resulting in atelectasis and, as I have said, should have been seen on the bronchoscopic study. A calcified lymph node could have eroded into the bronchial lumen, producing a broncholith and a ball-valve effect, but usually a broncholith either causes bleeding or is expectorated. Therefore, I doubt that that is the explanation for the opacity.Another possibility is the presence of a fungous ball in the interior of a cavity. For unclear reasons, fungi have a tendency to grow within cavities, with the production of fungous balls by the mycelia. Aspergillus is the fungus that is usually involved. The appearance of the lesion in this case is far different from that of fungous balls that I have seen, since they usually fill a larger proportion of the cavity, in which they generally float free. It would have been worthwhile to obtain an assay of serum precipitins for aspergillus, however, since their presence would have added support to this diagnosis. Even if this lesion turned out to be an aspergillus fungous ball it could not have been associated with the asthma, since allergic aspergillosis is an endobronchial lesion that produces finger-like opacities demonstrable on x-ray films and is not usually associated with mycetomas.In summary, it is obvious that the patient had a pneumatocele as well as bronchial stenosis. I must make a choice as to whether these lesions were congenital or acquired. I prefer to associate the opacity seen on the x-ray films with the bronchial stenosis and pneumatocele. A tomographic study might have been helpful in relating the proximity of the opacity to the stenosed airways. Congenital stenosis should not be associated with an opacity. I do not think that the opacity was a fungous ball or an intraluminal lesion for the reasons that I stated. Therefore, I favor a cicatricial lesion caused by a previous inflammatory process as the explanation for both the bronchial stenosis and the subsequent pneumatocele. I suspect that a foreign body was aspirated, although inspissated mucus could have been this \"foreign body.\" In addition, I think that the foreign body was dislodged into the pneumatocele, leaving scarred bronchi and accounting for the density in the pneumatocele demonstrated on the x-ray films.Finally, I am somewhat perplexed about the reason for the operation on the fourth hospital day. The description of collapse of the right upper and lower lobes suggests the development of generalized intrabronchial occlusion, perhaps precipitated by contrast medium or aspirated material. However, I think that bronchoscopic removal would have been the treatment of choice if that had been the situation.Dr. Homayoun Kazemi: I agree with you about the possibility of a pneumatocele and bronchial obstruction. The density in the middle of the cyst, however, is very suggestive of impacted mucus in the tracheobronchial tree in a patient with asthma. Dr. Kushner, will you comment about the shape of that density? Could it have been just a mucous plug?Dr. Kushner: Yes. The branching structure follows the course of the bronchial tree and could represent a mucous plug. The presence of such a plug within an area of lobar or segmental overinflation is suggestive of bronchial stenosis or, in an infant, bronchial atresia. In fact, although the patient is an adolescent, our preoperative diagnosis was bronchial stenosis with distal mucous impaction.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Calderwood, will you present the medical students' diagnosis?Dr. Stephen B. Calderwood: They thought that the most likely diagnosis was congenital bronchial atresia involving the medial segment of the right middle lobe, with secondary lobar emphysema. Other diagnoses considered were bronchial hypoplasia with obstructive emphysema and pulmonary sequestration.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Samuel H. Kim: The operation was performed through a right thoracotomy. We found marked over-inflation of the right middle lobe, which compressed the upper and lower lobes. On closer inspection the medial segment of the right middle lobe appeared overinflated and the lateral segment had the consistency of tapioca. Only one artery and one vein could be identified supplying the right middle lobe. We did not find a normal bronchial architecture, but multiple small bronchial communications were observed, especially in the minor fissure. A right middle lobectomy was performed.Dr. Eugene J. Mark: The excised lobe was rounded rather than polyhedral, and its edge was scalloped ([Fig. 3](#f003)). Its shape and enlargement, the frothy consistency of its lateral half, and its failure to deflate reflected marked air-trapping and hyperinflation. Sectioning of the hyperinflated lateral portion after fixation showed distention of distal air spaces and mucous impaction of small bronchi and bronchioles. Other areas were either atelectatic or consolidated by acute and organizing bronchopneumonia. There was also mucous impaction of larger bronchi. The mucous impaction corresponded to the branching densities observed on the x-ray films. The areas of hyperinflation surrounding some of the impacted bronchi correlate with the radiologic impression on plain films that the densities were within a cyst. No true cyst or pneumatocele was present.The bronchi were not hypoplastic. The plates of cartilage were normal in size, shape, and histologic appearance. However, the bronchi were partially collapsed, with plates of cartilage caved in one upon another and the mucosa thrown into redundant folds ([Fig. 4](#f004)). Examination of the epithelium disclosed mucinous metaplasia, with replacement of nonmucin-secreting ciliated cells by goblet cells. Besides the collapse, the bronchial lumens were further narrowed by marked hyperplasia of smooth muscle and a content of mucus and sloughed epithelium ([Fig. 5](#f005)). The basement membranes were markedly thickened ([Fig. 6](#f006)).The constellation of smooth-muscle hyperplasia, thickened basement membranes, mucosal edema, hyperplasia of mucinous epithelial cells, and shedding of epithelial cells into the lumen is the pathological expression of asthma.[6\u201311](#core-r006) No single feature is pathognomic of that disorder, and there is an overlap of the findings of asthma with those associated with chronic bronchitis and smoking.[12,13](#core-r012) Asthma is a broad syndrome that has multiple causes and is defined not pathologically but rather physiologically as a disease with wide variations of resistance to flow in intrapulmonary airways over short periods.[14](#core-r014) Nevertheless, the changes found in this case were prominent and extensive and indicate the diagnosis of asthma.Mucous impaction is an uncommon complication of asthma and can also occur with certain forms of bronchitis and cystic fibrosis.[15](#core-r015) The bronchial obstruction that it causes commonly results in atelectasis but may also produce emphysematous distention of peripheral alveoli.[15](#core-r015) I know of no case in which the degree of hyperinflation reached that seen in this case. The hyperinflation presumably arose from patency of proximal bronchi, aeration of some lobules, and collateral ventilation of other lobules with occluded bronchi or bronchioles. The partial collapse of the right-middle-lobe bronchus may have been due to mural inflammation associated with episodic mucous plugging or to extrinsic compression by the hyperinflated lung. I am not sure why the right middle lobe was involved rather than the other lobes. The disorder in this case may be a variant of the right-middle-lobe syndrome, in which the right-middle-lobe bronchus is subject to compression or kinking by enlarged lymph nodes, which form a collar at the origin of this bronchus from the right main-stem bronchus. The atypical presence of multiple bronchi in the right middle lobe to which Dr. Kim referred may also have had a role, although I am unsure whether these multiple bronchi were congenital or acquired as a result of inflammation.A Physician: How frequently do you see bronchial stenosis secondary only to mucous impaction in asthmatic patients?Dr. Mark: Bronchial narrowing due to post-inflammatory fibrosis has been reported with mucous impaction of the bronchi in relation to asthma and plastic bronchitis,[15](#core-r015) but it is rather unusual.Dr. Fanburg: Although an asthmatic mucous impaction often results in atelectasis, a hyperinflated lung giving the appearance of a pneumatocele secondary to mucous impaction must be extremely unusual. Are you aware of other cases similar to this one?Dr. Mark: There are rare reports of hyperinflation with mucous impaction and asthma,[15](#core-r015) but not to the degree seen in this case.Dr. Scully: Do you have a follow-up report on the patient, Dr. Kim?Dr. Kim: She had a smooth postoperative convalescence and was discharged home on the 10th post-operative day. She was seen six months after the operation and has had no problems. X-ray films of the chest show complete expansion of both remaining lobes. It is of interest that she has had no more wheezing and has required no further medication.Dr. Fanburg: The difference between a pneumatocele and obstructive emphysema may be that the latter is associated with at least partial retention of alveolar structures. The formation of one or the other after airway obstruction is probably physically determined. They may be indistinguishable radiologically. The central location of the immobile opacity should have suggested some internal structure in the area of hyperlucency.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Brian P. Walcott\n(Neurosurgery): A 37-year-old, right-handed woman was admitted to this hospital because of vertigo, left-sided weakness, and a mass in the brain on imaging studies.\nThe patient was in her usual state of health until 3 days before admission, when she suddenly had a sensation of the room spinning, associated with nausea and an unsteady gait. After approximately 4 hours, she went to the emergency department of another hospital. While in the emergency department, her symptoms worsened and numbness and weakness developed suddenly in the left arm. Subsequently, she had pain in the left thigh and involuntary movements of the left leg, which lasted for 25 minutes and resolved with the administration of intravenous lorazepam. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reportedly revealed a ring-enhancing mass, measuring 8 mm by 9 mm, in the right parietal lobe of the brain. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest reportedly showed an enhancing, lobulated mass in the right lower lobe of the lung, with features consistent with an arteriovenous malformation. Levetiracetam was begun, and she was admitted to that hospital; no further seizures occurred. At the patient's request, she was transferred on the third day to this hospital and admitted to the neurosurgical service.\nThe patient did not have fever, chills, headache, sinus or ear pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. She had a recent diagnosis of endometriosis, and an endometrial biopsy had been performed 2 weeks before admission. A dental procedure had been performed 9 days before presentation, with drainage of periodontal abscesses of the right upper quadrant. Since childhood, she had had numerous episodes of epistaxis. She had a long history of anemia and had been told she had a form of thalassemia. She worked in an office, was married, and lived with her husband and four children. She did not smoke, consume alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had not traveled recently. She was of Italian and Irish ancestry. Her father had congenital heart disease and had a valve replacement at 45 years of age, and one brother had cardiac valvular disease. Her mother, other siblings, and children were well. No members of her immediate family were known to have similar problems. She was allergic to sulfonamides and erythromycin. She had not taken any medications at home before this illness. Medications on admission included levetiracetam.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse 82 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/66 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. There were no cutaneous or buccal telangiectasias. There was packing over the gingiva of the right upper quadrant but no tenderness or evidence of active infection. There was no tenderness to palpation over the sinuses or mastoids. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. The heart sounds were normal, with no murmurs. The lungs were clear on auscultation and the abdomen was soft and nontender. On neurologic examination, the patient was alert and fully oriented. The pupils were 3.5 mm in diameter and symmetrically reactive to light exposure. The extraocular movements and visual acuity were intact, and the results of confrontation tests showed that the visual fields were normal. Sensation to light touch was decreased on the left side, with the leg affected more than the arm. Strength and deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The remainder of the detailed neurologic examination was normal.\nThe white-cell count was 14,500 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000) and the platelet count was normal; the hematocrit was 32.4% (reference range, 36.0 to 46.0), the hemoglobin level 10.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), the mean corpuscular volume 65 fl (reference range, 80 to 100), the mean corpuscular hemoglobin 21.3 pg per red cell (reference range, 26.0 to 34.0), the red-cell distribution width 19.1% (reference range, 11.5 to 14.5), and the C-reactive protein level 13.2 mg per liter (reference range for evaluation of inflammation, <8). Other routine laboratory tests, including measurement of electrolyte levels and tests of coagulation and of liver and renal function, were normal.\nMRI of the brain revealed an enhancing lesion, 1.9 cm by 2.2 cm by 2.8 cm, in the right posterior cingulate gyrus, associated with surrounding T\n2\n-weighted signal hyperintensity within the left posterior frontal and parietal lobes. On diffusion-weighted sequences, there were areas of restricted diffusion within the lesion but not beyond the area of susceptibility. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed a decrease in the\nN\n-acetyl aspartate peak, without definite evidence of a lactate doublet or a markedly elevated ratio of choline to creatinine associated with the lesion.\nLater that day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Fred G. Barker:* May we review the imaging studies?*Dr. Kenneth R. Davis:* MRI performed on arrival ([Figure 1A](#f01)) revealed a heterogeneous intraaxial lesion within the right posterior cingulate gyrus on T2-weighted images. There was intrinsic signal hyperintensity on T1-weighted images, correlating with a susceptibility artifact along the medial and superior aspects of the lesion. After the administration of contrast material ([Figure 1B](#f01)), the peripheral ring seen on T2-weighted sequencing enhanced. The remainder of the brain and cranial structures appeared normal. The lesion now measured 1.9 cm by 2.2 cm by 2.8 cm, which represented marked enlargement from the initial study 30 hours earlier.A diffusion-weighted MRI study ([Figure 1C](#f01)) was also performed as part of the routine imaging protocol. The images revealed a hyperintense central area that correlated to a hypointense region of the apparent-diffusion-coefficient image ([Figure 1D](#f01)); this correlation was consistent with restricted diffusion in the area of the lesion. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed, but its use was severely limited because of a low signal-to-noise ratio. There was a decrease in the *N*-acetyl aspartate peak, without definite evidence of a lactate doublet or markedly elevated choline-to-creatinine ratio. Perfusion-weighted MRI showed an increase in mean transit time ([Figure 1E](#f01)) within the lesion, which correlated to a decrease in cerebral blood volume ([Figure 1F](#f01)) in the same location. There was an increase in cerebral blood flow within the periphery of the lesion. Overall, there was a ring-enhancing intraaxial mass within the right posterior cingulate gyrus with evidence of surrounding vasogenic edema and nonspecific proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy characteristics that more than doubled in size during a period of 30 hours.*Dr. Barker:* I am aware of the diagnosis in this case. Establishing the diagnosis requires consideration of the distinct but related aspects of the patient's presentation: a long history of epistaxis, recent gingival manipulation, a recent endometrial biopsy, the new onset of focal neurologic symptoms, a cerebral mass that is rapidly enlarging, and the discovery of a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.\n### Brain Abscess\n\nAlthough the patient has a complex presentation, the details of her medical history help to establish a working differential diagnosis. The patient's neurologic symptoms began on the day of her initial presentation, with a sense of disequilibrium, nausea, and suspected focal-seizure activity on her left side. This information suggests intracranial pathology involving the right cerebral cortex. The sudden and rapidly progressive nature of her symptoms, measured in hours, is typical of brain abscesses.[1\u20133](#core-r001) A more rapid onset of symptoms, measured in minutes, would suggest a vascular or ischemic event, and a longer onset, measured in weeks to months, is more typical of a neoplastic process. In this young patient without a prolonged prodrome, prompt systemic and radiologic evaluation of these neurologic symptoms is required, since brain abscesses are treatable lesions. Undue delay could result in neurologic deficits.One of the most attention-commanding aspects of the patient's presentation is her recent periodontal surgery. Dental procedures are well-known risk factors for the development of cerebral abscesses.[4,5](#core-r004) She had also had an endometrial biopsy, and organisms from the vagina could have contaminated the biopsy site. Exacerbating her risk of hematogenous dissemination of bacteria was the presence of a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. The pulmonary circulation provides an important safeguard that limits the hematogenous spread of bacteria to the systemic circulation by the filtering action of the pulmonary capillaries. In the presence of an arteriovenous malformation, bacteria have easier access to the systemic circulation through a right-to-left pulmonary vascular shunt, regardless of its size.[6](#core-r006)Additional clinical and laboratory data support the diagnosis of an infectious cause of this patient's brain lesion. Although the patient remained afebrile, she had a persistently elevated white-cell count. Her level of C-reactive protein, an acute-phase protein with elevated levels in the serum of patients with acute inflammation, was also elevated. In patients with ring-enhancing brain lesions, an elevated C-reactive protein level is highly correlated with the presence of an infectious process and is less often seen in the presence of a brain neoplasm.[7,8](#core-r007)MRI provides further evidence that narrows the differential diagnosis. Many processes can present as cystic lesions with surrounding peripheral-ring enhancement, [9](#core-r009) including pyogenic brain abscesses, other infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis), malignant tumors, demyelinating diseases, and vascular lesions such as infarcts or hematomas. However, images in this case show a central core of restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted sequences, a peripheral ring of contrast enhancement after the administration of gadolinium, and a thin layer of concentric low signal intensity on T2-weighted sequencing \u2014 findings seen consistently only in brain abscesses.[10](#core-r010) Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy,[11](#core-r011) diffusion-weighted MRI,[12](#core-r012) and perfusion-weighted MRI are also of value in differentiating pyogenic brain abscesses from cystic brain tumors. Increased hyperintensity and a lower relative cerebral blood volume, as seen in this case, favor the diagnosis of a brain abscess over a necrotic or cystic tumor.[13](#core-r013) Finally, since this lesion had nearly doubled in size in just over 2 days, it was much more likely to be an abscess than a tumor.Cerebral abscesses may result from contiguous spread of infection from the mastoid or frontal sinuses, from direct trauma or neurosurgical procedures, or from hematogenous spread.[14](#core-r014) In this patient, imaging studies showed no evidence of contiguous spread from the oral cavity or other structures, and the likely source was hematogenous dissemination of organisms, either from the dental procedure or the endometrial biopsy. Brain abscesses are often polymicrobial, and the causative species differ depending on the source of the infection. Streptococcal species and anaerobes are frequent isolates from dental sources.[15](#core-r015)\n### Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia\n\nThe presence of a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation and the history of recurrent epistaxis raised the suspicion of a unifying hereditary syndrome. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a syndrome that results in arteriovenous malformations that affect numerous organs, including the nose (in >95% of cases), skin (in >80%), gastrointestinal tract (in 30%), lungs (in >30%), liver (in 30%), and brain (in 10%). [16](#core-r016) At presentation, this patient had two of the four Cura\u00e7ao criteria used to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (visceral arteriovenous malformation and epistaxis), but she did not have the other two (visible telangiectasia at characteristic sites such as the lips, oropharynx, nasal cavity, or fingers or a known family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia)[17](#core-r017) ([Table 1](#t01)).\n### Conclusions\n\nThe diagnosis in this case is most likely a polymicrobial brain abscess due to hematogenous spread of infection in a patient with a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. To guide treatment, the next step should be to perform an image-guided, stereotactic needle biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis and allow isolation of the causative organisms. In addition, investigation to establish a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is essential so that appropriate follow-up and prophylaxis can be undertaken and recurrence of cerebral abscesses and other problems associated with this disease can be prevented.[18](#core-r018)*Dr. Daniel P. Cahill:* Although the working diagnosis when the patient was transferred to our service was a brain tumor, the pace of onset and rapid growth of the lesion were more suggestive of an infectious process. We quickly proceeded to perform an image-guided, stereotactic needle biopsy of the lesion. A stereotactic head frame was affixed to the patient, an MRI scan was obtained, and commercially available software (Integra Radionics) was used to guide the selection of target points for the procurement of biopsy specimens. The patient was then transferred to the operating room, where she was placed in a semisitting position and given conscious sedation and a local anesthetic. We performed a burr-hole craniotomy so we could obtain a needle-biopsy specimen of the wall of the lesion, which we submitted for intraoperative pathological examination. A second target in the center of the lesion was chosen, the needle was advanced to this point, and 4 ml of purulent material was aspirated and sent for pathological and microbiologic studies. Finally, 1 mg of gentamicin was instilled locally into the cavity through the biopsy needle. The wound was closed in the standard fashion, and the patient recovered well without neurologic deficit from the procedure.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Matthew P. Frosch:* We received specimens directly from the operating room, including a specimen of brain tissue from a core needle biopsy and an aspirate consisting of gelatinous mucoid material. Examination of a smear and frozen sections ([Figure 2A](#f02)) revealed acute inflammatory cells, macrophages, and necrotic debris characteristic of an acute inflammatory process. Permanent histologic sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed necrotic tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. No evidence of a malignant tumor was identified. Gram's staining of the purulent exudate ([Figure 2B](#f02)) obtained from the second target revealed the presence of abundant gram-positive cocci. A specimen with Grocott methenamine\u2013silver nitrate staining showed no fungal organisms. These findings were diagnostic of a brain abscess of bacterial origin.Gram's staining of smears prepared in the microbiology laboratory revealed abundant gram-positive cocci in pairs and abundant gram-negative rods. Cultures of the contents of the abscess revealed mixed flora consisting of the aerobic *Streptococcus anginosus* group and anaerobic *Fusobacterium nucleatum*.\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Cahill:* Options for the management of brain abscesses range from medical treatment with antibiotics alone, medical treatment combined with biopsy and aspiration of the lesion, and open excision of the abscess, if it is large enough to cause neurologic symptoms from a mass effect or prove resistant to antibiotic therapy.[19\u201321](#core-r019) The goal is to reduce the mass effect while providing effective control of the infection. Although antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of treatment, it is rarely used empirically in the absence of data from cultures. Examination of a sample of the contents of the abscess enables determination of microbial species and sensitivities, allowing for targeted antibiotic therapy. Aspiration of the contents of the abscess reduces the mass effect and the burden of microorganisms and allows for direct irrigation of the abscess cavity with antibiotic solution, as was done in this case. When performed with MRI guidance, frame-based stereotactic procedures such as the one performed in this case precisely localize the abscess cavity and limit the possibility of neurologic damage, especially in areas near eloquent cortex.[19\u201321](#core-r019)After the operation, physicians with expertise in infectious diseases were consulted. The isolate of *S. anginosus* was sensitive to all tested antibiotics. On the physicians' recommendation, broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole was begun.*Dr. Sanjeeva P. Kalva:* During the same admission, the patient was evaluated for treatment of the pulmonary arteriovenous malformation to avert future complications. A pulmonary angiogram ([Figure 3A](#f03)) revealed two arteriovenous malformations in the right lung. The feeding arteries were selectively catheterized, and the malformations were successfully embolized with microcoils ([Figure 3B](#f03)). On follow-up evaluation with CT angiography, approximately 3 months after the initial embolization, a small pulmonary arteriovenous malformation was seen adjacent to the original lesion in the right lower lobe. We recommended embolization of this new lesion, which was performed without complications.*Dr. Brian V. Nahed* (Neurosurgery): A rash developed that was thought to be caused by ceftriaxone, and the drug was discontinued. An echocardiogram that was obtained to rule out the possibility of endocarditis showed no valvular vegetations or intracardiac shunting. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on the ninth day with instructions to follow up with specialists in the divisions of infectious diseases and genetics. Treatment with intravenous vancomycin and oral metronidazole was continued for 6 weeks. Because of the history of epistaxis, the patient underwent outpatient otolaryngology evaluation at another facility. She reported that the examination revealed innumerable nasal mucosal telangiectasias.A consultant from Medical Genetics saw the patient while she was in the hospital and at follow-up.*Dr. Inderneel Sahai:* At the time of presentation, the patient did not fulfill criteria for a clinical diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, since she had only a history of epistaxis and a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. We therefore advised genetic testing to establish a diagnosis. Most cases of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are due to mutations in one of three genes: *ENG,* associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1; *ACVRL1,* associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2; or *SMAD4,* associated with juvenile polyposis and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Genetic studies, including full sequencing and deletion and duplication analyses of *ACVRL1,* *ENG,* and *SMAD4* genes, revealed no mutations in this case. Likewise, approximately 20% of families who fulfill the Cura\u00e7ao criteria for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia do not have mutations in any of these genes.[22](#core-r022) Loci on chromosomes 5 and 7 have been associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in two families,[23,24](#core-r023) but the genes associated with these loci have not been identified and testing is not available.Although the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia could not initially be confirmed, we cautioned that the diagnosis had not been conclusively ruled out, since other clinical findings may become more apparent with age. We therefore advised that the patient follow the surveillance and precautions recommended for people with a confirmed diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. These include periodic physical examinations, incorporating inspection for telangiectases, stool assessment for occult blood, and a complete blood count to assess for anemia. The patient already has evidence of a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation; a vascular specialist should follow up on it. Further evaluation for anemia revealed normal levels of iron and ferritin, which suggest that her anemia was not due to blood loss. However, bleeding from gastrointestinal telangiectases most commonly begins after 40 years of age and often becomes increasingly severe with age. Because of the patient's history of epistaxis, she was advised to avoid vigorous nose blowing, cautery for nosebleeds, and anticoagulant and antiinflammatory agents. In addition, we recommended that she take prophylactic antibiotics for dental and other procedures.Subsequent evaluation showed nasal telangiectasias, fulfilling clinical criteria for the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Since hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant condition, each of the patient's children has a 50% likelihood of being affected, and her siblings are also at risk. Since she does not have an identifiable mutation, genetic testing of first-degree relatives is not indicated. However, surveillance of her children and siblings is recommended, including screening for pulmonary and cerebral arteriovenous malformations; annual evaluation for epistaxis or other bleeding, shortness of breath or decreased exercise tolerance, and headache or other neurologic symptoms; and periodic laboratory evaluation for anemia and occult blood in the stool.\n",

      "question": "A 61-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of abdominal pain and a mass in the right side of the abdomen.\nHe was well until six weeks earlier, when crampy pain developed in the lower portion of the abdomen and frequently radiated throughout the entire abdomen. The pain occurred as often as eight times daily, without relation to meals, and lasted for two or three minutes each time. A barium-enema examination (\nFig. 1\n) was negative except that the cecum was oriented horizontally; an upper gastrointestinal series showed no abnormality. During the week before admission the episodes of abdominal pain became progressively more severe. On the day of entry another physician found a mass in the right side of the abdomen, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.\nThere was a history of hypertension that was managed with chlorthalidone, and there was a 25 pack-year history of cigarette smoking. The patient had nocturia during the year preceding entry. He experienced anorexia, constipation, and abdominal distention during his recent illness and used milk of magnesia and magnesium citrate in an attempt to alleviate his symptoms. He had lost 9 kg in weight in recent weeks. There was no history of fever, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, diarrhea, previous abdominal pain, a previous abdominal operation, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or tuberculosis.\nThe temperature was 37.9\u00b0C, the pulse was 120, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\nThe patient was black. On examination he appeared well nourished and not acutely ill. No lymphadenopathy was found. The head, neck, lungs, and heart were normal. The abdomen was mildly protuberant, with normal bowel sounds; the liver and spleen were not felt; the vertical span of the liver was 9 cm. A slightly pulsatile, tender mass, 10 cm, was palpated in the right upper abdominal quadrant and extended to the right midabdomen; the mass did not appear to be attached to the liver or aorta and did not descend on inspiration. No hernia, muscle spasm, rebound tenderness, or psoas or obturator sign was found. Rectal examination revealed that the prostate gland was three times normal in size, smooth, and symmetric; no stool specimen was available. Neurologic examination was negative.\nThe urine was dark yellow and gave a + test for ketones; the sediment was normal. The hematocrit was 38.3 percent; the white-cell count was 11,400, with 73 percent neutrophils, 14 percent lymphocytes, and 13 percent monocytes. The platelet count was 270,000, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 52 mm per hour. The prothrombin time was 10.1 seconds, with a control of 11 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 24 seconds. The urea nitrogen was 12 mg per 100 ml (4.3 mmol per liter), the glucose 95 mg per 100 ml (5.3 mmol per liter), the conjugated bilirubin 0.4 mg per 100 ml (7 \u03bcmol per liter), the total bilirubin 0.9 mg (20 \u03bcmol per liter), the uric acid 6.1 mg per 100 ml (360 \u03bcmol per liter), the triglyceride 47 mg, the cholesterol 180 mg per 100 ml (4.7 mmol per liter), the calcium 9.6 mg per 100 ml (2.4 per liter), the phosphorus 2.7 mg per 100 ml (0.32 mmol per liter), and the protein 7.0 g (the albumin 3.7 g and the globulin 3.3 g) per 100 ml. The sodium was 136 mmol, the potassium 4.6 mmol, the chloride 95 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 31 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) was 32 U, the amylase 90 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 46 U per liter. An electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal rhythm at 98, with minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. X-ray films of the chest showed that the heart and lungs were normal and the pleural spaces were clear. Films of the abdomen revealed a normal pattern of bowel gas and no unusual soft-tissue or calcific densities. An ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen showed that the aorta appeared normal in size, without aneurysmal dilatation; in the right paraumbilical region there was a soft-tissue mass, 4 by 6 cm, with a complex echotexture and ill-defined margins. The liver and spleen were normal in size and echotexture; the gallbladder was not enlarged, and no evidence of gallstones was seen; the pancreas was obscured by overlying bowel gas; two smooth, echolucent cysts were visible in the upper pole of the right kidney, and the left kidney appeared normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen (\nFig. 2\n), obtained after the administration of contrast material by mouth, disclosed a normal appearance of the liver, spleen, and pancreas; the right kidney contained a rounded area of low attenuation at its upper pole and in its midpole; both abnormalities were believed consistent with renal cysts; the left kidney was normal. A round to ovoid mass of soft-tissue density, 10 to 12 cm in diameter, extended along the right flank, just medial to the ascending colon, and contained small collections of gas; contrast material was observed within the small bowel to the level of the mass. None of the orally administered contrast material was observed within the mass during the initial study; delayed scans through the region of the mass, obtained two hours after the administration of the contrast material, disclosed a small amount of contrast material within it. No other mass or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy was observed.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. James M. Richter\\*: In summary, this 61-year-old black man was well until six weeks before admission except for mild hypertension. He initially reported crampy abdominal pain to a physician. Although the physical examination was presumably negative or at least failed to reveal a mass, his symptoms progressed. On a second examination six weeks later a moderately large abdominal mass was identified. The patient was anorectic and had lost 9 kg in weight but apparently had no systemic symptoms. The results of laboratory studies were remarkably normal. I shall ask Dr. Ferrucci to present the principal radiographic findings.Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: A plain film of the abdomen done in conjunction with the barium studies about six weeks before entry shows no unusual gas or calcific densities in the right midabdomen, where the process emerged later in the hospital course. A single filled film from the barium-enema study ([Fig. 1](#f001)) discloses no obvious diverticula of the distal colon. There is some accentuation of haustral markings in the sigmoid colon, probably reflecting early diverticular disease. The cecum was described in the case record as being horizontally oriented, and one can appreciate this abnormality on the film of the filled colon as well as the post-evacuation view. I interpret this finding as consistent with a normal variation in the orientation of the cecum, even though a mass appeared in this region six weeks later. As Dr. Richter pointed out, the inability of the examining physicians to palpate a mass at the time that the barium-enema examination was ordered supports my interpretation that the orientation of the cecum was simply a normal variation. The upper gastrointestinal study reveals no abnormality, and the loops of small bowel appear normal down to about the proximal portion of the ileum. The study was terminated as only a gastrointestinal series at that point, without a formal small-bowel follow-through study.At the time of admission six weeks later the ultrasonographic study of the upper abdomen showed a normal appearance of the aorta and two small benign-appearing cysts at the upper pole of the right kidney. An image taken in the transverse plane in the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a very ill-defined, complex mass without sharply defined margins. There are several echogenic areas within it with faint shadows behind it that appeared at real time to be collections of gas. The mass was difficult to measure because it was not sharply defined, and the dimension given in the case record of about 6 cm is smaller than what was subsequently recorded with more precision on CT scanning.The CT scans of the abdomen ([Fig. 2](#f002)) show the cystic lesions in the right kidney; the liver and pancreas appear normal. On a section below the kidneys one can see a fairly large mass in the right lower quadrant separate from the aorta, perhaps compressing the anterior wall of the inferior vena cava slightly. There are strand-like densities in the fat adjacent to the wall of the ascending colon, but the mass itself is fairly well demarcated. Several small collections of air are visible within the center of the mass; no calcification is seen. The loops of small bowel are not dilated, and there is no obvious contrast material within the mass to reveal additional information about the origin of these gas bubbles. A CT scan taken two hours later to see whether any contrast material would enter these small gas collections was in my view equivocal. Some observers thought that there was a small amount of contrast material within the mass; others were uncertain.In summary, the principal finding was a gas-containing mass that was probably in relation to the mesentery or the distal small bowel, or both, and possibly the ascending colon. The cysts in the kidney are of no consequence.Dr. Richter: Was contrast material injected intravenously during the computed tomographic scan?Dr. Ferrucci: No.Dr. Richter: The discriminating radiographic features were largely restricted to the computed tomograms, which demonstrated an ovoid mass of soft-tissue density in the mesentery in the right midabdomen. The mass was 10 to 12 cm across and heterogeneous. It seemed to communicate with the small intestine, as manifested by the presence of small pockets of air within the mass and the possible appearance of contrast material that had been administered by mouth two hours earlier. These findings focus our attention on a mass closely associated with and possibly communicating with the ileum or the ascending colon. Masses in this area are mainly inflammatory or neoplastic.Crohn's disease is a common inflammatory condition of the digestive tract that frequently presents with a mass and fistulas. Crohn's disease usually occurs in adolescents or young adults but can present at any time of life.[1](#core-r001) The inflammation generally extends through all layers of the gut wall and may involve the mesentery and lymph nodes, producing palpable abdominal masses. Although the ileum and the colon are the most common sites of involvement, Crohn's disease may affect any segment of the alimentary tract and is frequently discontinuous. Diarrhea and abdominal pain are the most common presenting manifestations. Fever, hematochezia, occult bleeding, fistulas, and a mass are less common but very important presentations. The clinical course of Crohn's disease is noteworthy for its variability. The heterogeneous clinical profile of Crohn's disease certainly includes the findings in this case. It is, however, somewhat unusual for such a large inflammatory mass to develop within six weeks without fever, tenderness, or systemic signs of inflammation. In addition, there was no history of diarrhea or hematochezia, but a test for occult blood in the feces was not done. Although I do not exclude the possibility of Crohn's disease with confidence, this picture does not fit well and I shall relegate this disease to a secondary consideration.Another important inflammatory process in this area is a periappendiceal or diverticular abscess. The appendix was not filled on the barium-enema examination, a finding that is consistent with appendiceal disease. The mass seemed to communicate with the bowel on the CT scan, however, and I would be surprised if a periappendiceal abscess, which may be associated with occlusion of the appendiceal lumen, would communicate so freely later. No diverticula were seen in the barium-enema study, making a diverticular abscess unlikely. It is unusual to find such a large inflammatory process in a patient who is both immunocompetent and systemically well, and it is primarily on this clinical basis that I shall dismiss the possibility of a periappendiceal or diverticular abscess.[2\u20134](#core-r002)Mesenteric lipodystrophy is another inflammatory lesion that may present with abdominal pain and a mesenteric and paraluminal mass. The masses associated with this condition, however, are seldom as large and rapidly growing as the mass in this patient.[5](#core-r005) In addition, these masses do not communicate with the lumen of the intestine. Consequently, it is very unlikely that mesenteric lipodystrophy was responsible for the findings in this patient.A more important consideration is a tumor. By far the most common neoplasm in this part of the abdomen is cancer of the colon. Colon cancer is such an important consideration that it should probably lead almost every discussion of masses in the right side of the abdomen. There are now over 100,000 new cases of colon cancer in the United States per year. The frequency of this cancer rises sharply with age, particularly after 50 years. The most common presentations of colonic cancer are bleeding, change in bowel habit, and abdominal pain. Because the lesion in the patient under discussion presumably arose in the ascending colon one would expect the bleeding to have been occult. The patient was unaware of any bleeding and a test for occult blood in the feces was not performed, but the hemoglobin level was only slightly diminished. The patient had noted distention and constipation and had taken laxatives for attempted relief. The presence of distention during these symptoms suggests partial obstruction, which is infrequent in patients with cancer of the ascending colon unless the ileum or the ileocecal valve is involved. Perforation of a carcinoma of the colon may result in localized peritonitis and abscess formation[6](#core-r006) and might explain the apparent sudden increase in the size of the lesion in this patient. We are told, however, that a satisfactory barium-enema examination, which has a sensitivity for colon cancer of about 80 percent, was performed recently and was negative. Colon cancer is also a relatively slowly growing tumor, and it would be unusual for it to be undetectable on abdominal examination and then appear as a 12-cm mass six weeks later.[7](#core-r007) Although colon cancer should never be dismissed as a possibility when one is considering masses in the right side of the abdomen, many features of this man's findings do not fit that diagnosis very well.Adenocarcinoma of the ileum is much less common than colon cancer, and in the ileum adenocarcinomas may complicate Crohn's disease. The hypothesis that a neoplasm developed in the ileum is attractive in this case because the ileum was not adequately studied by the barium-contrast examinations and appeared to course through the mass on the computed tomographic study. Adenocarcinoma of the ileum, however, has a biologic behavior similar to that of colon cancer, and more severe obstruction would be expected before the mass attained a diameter of 12 cm. It is unusual for this type of tumor to grow rapidly or undergo necrosis, ulceration, or fistula formation so prominently.Lymphomas of the gastrointestinal tract occur in the ileum and are second in frequency only to those in the stomach. Lymphomas of the ileum present with abdominal pain, weight loss, alteration of bowel habits, and anemia. The abdominal pain, such as that experienced by this patient, is usually crampy and intermittent, produced by partial small-bowel obstruction. Some patients with diffuse lymphoma have steatorrhea and malabsorption, which were not features of this man's illness. The presence of a prominent mass suggests a localized form of the disease. Although lymphomas may grow rapidly, they usually do not reach a size discernible by palpation. Systemic symptoms such as fever are prominent. Perforation occurs in up to 20 percent of patients with intestinal lymphoma, although it generally occurs after chemotherapy. Occult bleeding and anemia are also common but were not features of this man's illness. Although lymphoma usually does not involve the liver or spleen initially, a rapidly growing tumor would also be expected to involve the lymph nodes, liver, or spleen. In addition, the texture of a lymphoma as demonstrated on computed tomographic scanning tends to be homogeneous and to blend with surrounding tissues, whereas the mass in this case was fairly well demarcated and somewhat heterogeneous.[8\u201312](#core-r008) Nevertheless, lymphoma is thus far my leading consideration.Other important neoplasms of the digestive tract are those of smooth-muscle origin. Leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma occur in the ileum, where they are second in frequency only to similar tumors arising in the stomach. Leiomyosarcomas are distinguished from leiomyomas by their large size, generally greater than 6 cm in diameter, a heterogeneous tissue density, and the more frequent presence of ulceration or fistula formation.[13,14](#core-r013) Smooth-muscle tumors arise from the muscularis propria and typically grow away from the lumen, attaining a large size before causing compression of the lumen and obstructive symptoms. Constitutional symptoms are not prominent in these patients. Ulcers may be extensive and deep and fill with gas or orally administered contrast material. Lymphnode metastases are rarely seen. Metastases usually occur late and involve mainly the liver, lung, spleen, and bones. Leiomyosarcomas are very vascular and are enhanced with intravenously administered contrast material. Occasionally, calcification is observed. It is striking that the clinical and radiographic findings in this case fit closely with those expected with a leiomyosarcoma. This malignant smooth-muscle tumor, however, is extraordinarily rare. Its rarity is the major argument against the diagnosis of a leiomyosarcoma in this patient.Carcinoid tumor is a relatively common neoplasm of the small intestine and frequently occurs in the ileocecal region. It is usually clinically silent and benign. When it does become symptomatic it causes abdominal pain and obstructive symptoms but results in the appearance of the carcinoid syndrome only after metastasis to the liver. Although carcinoids may grow to a large size, they are generally not as rapidly growing as the lesion in this case. Primary carcinoid tumors are often not apparent on computed tomographic scanning. More commonly, lymph-node metastases or adjacent stellate or desmoplastic responses in the mesentery adjacent to the primary tumor are seen, producing displacement and kinking of the adjacent bowel.[15](#core-r015)Occasionally, malignant tumors of other origins metastasize to the bowel. The most frequent offender is melanoma, which is unusual in black persons. The evidence of renal cysts on the computed tomographic study raises the question of a renal-cell carcinoma. However, the absence of hematuria and the confidence of our radiologic colleagues that the cysts were benign help to exclude that possibility.If I had been the attending physician of this patient I would have been concerned that he had a neoplasm, probably a malignant one. It would have been helpful to have the results of a test for occult blood in the feces, a small-bowel follow-through study, and a computed tomographic examination after the intravenous administration of contrast material, but these findings were not necessary. I would have needed precise information on which to base my therapeutic decisions and would have recommended a laparotomy for a biopsy, excision, or bypass of the lesion. I would not have been particularly concerned with the preoperative histologic considerations because my clinical assessment, largely on the basis of the radiographic findings, would not have been sufficiently precise to plan therapy for this patient. However, in the context of a clinicopathological conference, clinicians are asked to step into the domain of the pathologist and speculate on the histologic findings. The clinical and radiographic findings in this case closely simulate those expected with a leiomyosarcoma of the ileum. The major argument against this diagnosis is its infrequency. Colon cancer, lymphoma, and Crohn's disease cannot be excluded with confidence. The available data, however, do not fit the expected presentation of these conditions as precisely as they do that of a leiomyosarcoma.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Goldfinger, do you have any comments?Dr. Stephen E. Goldfinger: Dr. Richter, you excluded a periappendiceal abscess on the basis of the absence of the constitutional findings that one would expect. Nevertheless, in postulating the presence of various tumors \u2014 leiomyosarcoma, lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, and so forth \u2014 one has to suspect a perforation because of the presence of air within the mass. Whatever occurred happened over a period of a few weeks, and since gas was present in the mass one should assume that there was an abscess. Why should one minimize the likelihood of perforation of an appendix with an abscess on the basis of the clinical course and yet find it compatible with perforation of other lesions, such as a malignant tumor?Dr. Richter: That is a very good question and points out a more subtle interpretation of the radiographs and the clinical findings. If this lesion had been an abscess developing over a period of six weeks one would expect extensive liquefaction of the mass, and if it communicated freely with the lumen of the bowel one would expect not just a few small spots of air and a few drops of contrast material but a relatively wide open, large cavity, which was not demonstrated.Dr. Goldfinger: Unless gas-forming organisms were producing the air.Dr. Richter: If there were gas-forming organisms one would have to discount the apparent communication between the lumen of the bowel and the mass or the passage of orally administered contrast material into the mass.Dr. Ferrucci: If this lesion had been an intraabdominal abscess, which we often see by CT scanning, it would have had to result in a very large mass effect to have so little gas and so little central liquefaction in it. The preoperative impression of the Radiology Department was essentially the diagnosis that you have made \u2014 a spindle-cell sarcoma of the bowel.Dr. Edward A. Edwards: Although the mass is said to have been slightly pulsatile on physical examination, there was no notation of a bruit.Dr. Grant V. Rodkey: It was slightly pulsatile, but there was no bruit. Since I thought that the pulsation was probably transmitted, I was a little concerned about the possibility of an aortic aneurysm presenting on the right side, and that was one of the reasons for sending the patient immediately from my office to the Department of Radiology for the ultrasound study.Dr. Scully: Dr. Kamitsuka, will you give us the medical students' diagnosis?Dr. Paul F. Kamitsuka: The medical students considered several diagnostic possibilities, including a distal small-bowel duplication, a mucocele of the appendix, a perforated diverticulum with an associated inflammatory mass, and a tumor, such as a leiomyoma or a leiomyosarcoma. They thought that a leiomyosarcoma fit best with the clinical findings and favored an exploratory laparotomy as the diagnostic procedure of choice.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Scully: Dr. Rodkey, will you tell us your preoperative impressions and describe the operative findings?Dr. Rodkey: My preoperative diagnosis was lymphoma. I also considered the possibility of a leiomyosarcoma. Both tumors can ulcerate into the lumen of the bowel and be associated with necrosis and pockets of gas within the tumor. Both of these tumors could progress very rapidly and form a sizable mass within the period observed. Because both of them should have produced a more distinct outline on the x-ray studies after the administration of contrast material, I was not confident of either diagnosis. Our preoperative diagnosis was lymphoma, with perforation and communication with the intestinal lumen.At operation we encountered a mass in the right midabdomen extending up into the right upper quadrant but involving the cecum, with the terminal ileum adherent at its periphery. The mass appeared to be inflammatory, as judged by the appearance of its external surface. It was very firm and discrete, and I was able to dissect it freely from all the surrounding structures. Even though I thought that it might be a chronic abscess rather than a neoplasm on the basis of its appearance, it seemed wiser to excise the mass with a surrounding margin of normal tissue and reanastomose the intestine. I removed the terminal ileum and the cecum and anastomosed the ileum to the midascending colon.Dr. Edward J. Gutmann: The excised mass was 8 cm in diameter ([Fig. 3](#f003)). Sectioning through its center revealed an abscess cavity, 2 cm in diameter and filled with brown pus, within the pericecal fat. Opening of the cecum disclosed three discrete perforated diverticula. Each perforation terminated in a fistulous tract that coursed 4 cm through the pericolic fat and communicated with the abscess cavity ([Fig. 4](#f004)).Microscopical examination of each diverticulum revealed a herniation of mucosa and submucosa through thickened muscularis propria, characteristic of colonie diverticula. The wall of each diverticulum was acutely inflamed and extensively ulcerated, with resultant rupture ([Fig. 5](#f005)). Histologic examination of the pericolic soft tissue revealed dense accumulations of neutrophils and cellular debris surrounded by granulation tissue and a small amount of fibrous tissue. The histologic features of the abscess are consistent with a pathologic process of approximately six weeks' duration, which correlates with the clinical history. No diverticula were present in the resected segment of the ascending colon. The outer portion of the wall of both the intact appendix and the distal ileum contained chronic inflammatory cells, reflecting a reaction to the cecal abscess. Transmural inflammation and granulomas typical of Crohn's disease were absent.Diverticulosis is usually asymptomatic.[16](#core-r016) \"Diverticular disease\" refers to symptomatic diverticulosis. In a review of 338 cases of colonic diverticular disease treated surgically at this hospital, Rodkey and Welch[17](#core-r017) observed that the primary pathologic focus was in the sigmoid colon in over 95 percent of the cases and in the ascending colon in less than 5 percent of the cases. In contrast to its rarity in this country, right-sided diverticular disease predominates in Japan.[18](#core-r018)Cecal diverticula can be congenital, containing all layers of the colonic wall, or as in this case acquired, with their walls composed of mucosa and submucosa only. Cecal diverticulitis may be difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds, and confusion with acute appendicitis is common, as demonstrated by a case discussed at one of these exercises last year.[19](#core-r019)In 1946 Cohen and Matthews[20](#core-r020) observed that a diverticulum could burrow or dissect longitudinally within the colonic wall.[21](#core-r021) An extension of this notion of a dissecting diverticulum was the recognition that perforation of an inflamed diverticulum could result in a burrowing abscess within the bowel wall or in pericolic tissue (dissecting peridiverticulitis). The case under discussion is an example of dissecting peridiverticulitis. Although the three diverticula could have perforated independently, another sequence seems more probable. I suggest that a pericolic abscess resulting from rupture of a single inflamed diverticulum dissected longitudinally within pericolic tissue, and the other diverticula caught in the path of the dissection ruptured, creating multiple sites of fistulous communication with the cecal lumen ([Fig. 6](#f006)).[22](#core-r022)The presence of such a paracolic sinus tract can result in the demonstration of a double track of barium on x-ray studies. Such a track is not pathognomonic of a particular disease. At this hospital of 35 cases with pathological evidence of an extraluminal sinus tract adjacent to the sigmoid colon, 29 were examples of peridiverticulitis, 5 were the result of a perforated carcinoma, and 1 was associated with Crohn's disease complicating diverticulosis.[22](#core-r022) The last case in this series reminds us that the common, usually asymptomatic, condition of diverticulosis can be accompanied by a more troublesome disorder. Moreover, a coexisting disease can cause diverticulitis in a patient with diverticula. For example, in Crohn's disease an aphthous ulcer can involve the mucosa of a diverticulum directly or a transmural fissure can result in a pericolic abscess that dissects into an adjacent diverticulum, causing peridiverticulitis.[23](#core-r023)Dr. Rodkey: In 1961 Dr. Gilbert Hermann and I[24](#core-r024) studied the experience at this hospital with diverticular disease over the preceding 20 years. There were 14 cases of involvement of the cecum in a series of 269 cases of colonie diverticular disease. During the past 40 years on the basis of more than a thousand reported cases of diverticulitis we can say confidently that the diverticulitis of the cecum accounts for about 1 to 2 percent of all the cases and that in an additional 2 percent of the cases involvement of the ascending colon occurs.[25](#core-r025) Diverticular disease of the cecum differs from that of the remainder of the colon in that the average age at onset is 15 years less than the average age for diverticulitis in the left side of the colon \u2014 that is, about 45 years as opposed to 60 years, respectively. We suspect that the occurrence of a congenital form of diverticular disease of the cecum is related to its earlier average onset of symptoms.Dr. Scully: Is there an increased frequency of leftsided diverticulosis in cases of diverticular disease of the cecum?Dr. Rodkey: Diffuse diverticular disease may also involve the ascending colon. In general, diverticular disease related to the muscle hypertrophy or neuromuscular dysfunction starts in the sigmoid colon and over a period of years may extend into the ascending colon. In the cases to which I am referring, however, the lesions are examples of primary cecal diverticular disease that usually occur without demonstrable diverticula in the remainder of the colon, as was true in this patient.Dr. Margaret E. Warner: If you had known in advance that the lesion was diverticulitis would it have been necessary to resect it?Dr. Rodkey: The answer to that question is complex. An inflammatory mass that has progressed to this size is optimally treated by resection. Of course, in this case we were not certain even at the time of operation that a neoplasm did not underlie the inflammation, since both can be present if a tumor has perforated. However, in a case in which a very small region is involved by diverticulitis one may do a local resection.\n",

      "question": "A sixty-nine-year-old widow entered the hospital because of extreme weakness for about one year and jaundice for about one month.\nThe patient dated the onset of poor health from an operation for ruptured appendix followed by peritonitis and drainage at the age of thirty-five. A postoperative ventral hernia was repaired but recurred. At the age of forty-four she received the diagnosis of \"pernicious anemia\" while seeing a doctor for reasons she did not remember. For this she was urged to eat raw liver, which she was unable to do because of vomiting; injections were discontinued because they were painful; \"copper and iron\" tablets were taken. She had not had antianemia treatment for years. A subtotal thyroidectomy was performed at the age of sixty-three for \"toxic goiter.\" Radiograms at another hospital at the age of sixty-seven showed an enlarged heart; an electrocardiogram disclosed auricular fibrillation, left bundle-branch block and left ventricular strain. Although she had not considered herself in good health for \"many\" years, the patient noticed that her usual weakness became more pronounced six months before entry, following the death of a son; anorexia likewise appeared and increased. During this time her weight had decreased from 178 to 158 pounds (several years previously she had weighed 240 pounds but had not tried to reduce). During the four weeks before entry her attention had been called to the gradually increasing yellowish discoloration of her skin, which had steadily progressed. Itching of the skin over the arms and anterior chest was present during the first week of jaundice but then abated. This was not accompanied by pain, clay-colored stools, nausea, vomiting or fever. The urine was noted to be darker than usual. There was no previous episode of jaundice, no change in bowel habits or stools and no history of exposure to jaundiced persons, chemicals or transfusions. She did not drink alcohol.\nPhysical examination revealed a moderately icteric woman, lying in bed in moderate distress as evidenced by rapid, forced respirations. Moderate palmar erythema was noted. No spider angiomas were present. The scleras were icteric. The chest was emphysematous; moist rales were present at both bases, more marked on the left. The heart was enlarged, the point of maximal impulse being 2 cm. left of the midclavicular line. The rhythm was irregular. The sounds were of good quality; the pulmonic second sound was markedly greater than the aortic; a Grade II, rough systolic murmur was best heard at the lower sternal border. The abdomen was obese. A large ventral hernia occupied the left lower quadrant. The liver was palpated 11 cm. below the costal margin in the midclavicular line; the edge was firm, sharp and nontender. The splenic tip was questionably palpable. A ++ pitting edema was present over the lower two thirds of the leg and the sacrum. The knee jerks and ankle jerks were absent; vibratory sense was absent in both ankles and the right knee.\nThe blood pressure was 92 systolic, 48 diastolic. The temperature was 100\u00b0F., the pulse 96, and the respirations 28.\nThe blood showed a red-cell count of 3,820,000, with a hemoglobin of 10.8 gm. The white-cell count, was 7600, with 88 per cent neutrophils, and later ranged between 12,000 and 16,000. Urinalysis revealed a + test for albumin, and bile. The fasting blood sugar was 124 mg. per 100 cc., the sodium 133.9 milliequiv., and the chloride 101 milliequiv. per liter. The total protein was 5.6 gm. per 100 cc., with an albumin-globulin ratio of 3.3/2.33. The nonprotein nitrogen was 20 mg. per 100 cc., and the alkaline phosphatase 12.9 units, reaching 22.3 units on the eighteenth day. The prothrombin time was normal on admission and only slightly elevated later. The van den Bergh reaction was 8.7 mg. per 100 cc. direct, 13.2 mg. indirect. The amylase was 33 units per 100 cc.; the cephalin-flocculation test was + in twenty-four hours, ++ in forty-eight hours and, twenty days later, +++ in twenty-four hours and ++++ in forty-eight hours. The cholesterol was 139 mg. and the cholesterol esters 54 mg. per 100 cc.; the thymol flocculation was negative, the thymol turbidity 2.10 units, the urine urobilinogen 3.0 to 7.3 Ehrlich units, and the stool urobilinogen normal. The stools were guaiac negative, and cultures were negative for pathogens. A heterophil-antibody test was negative. The blood culture was negative. The clotting time (without tube) was 9 minutes, and the bleeding time (ear puncture), 1 minute. A bone-marrow aspiration revealed a slight shift to the left in the myeloid and also in the erythroid series; no megaloblasts or other abnormal cells were seen. An electrocardiogram revealed auricular fibrillation, at a rate of 100, a QRS complex of 0.12 second, low to absent R wave in Lead V\n2\nand V\n4\nand left bundle-branch block. A gastric aspiration on the fifth hospital day failed to reveal any free acid, but \"pure bile\" was present.\nRadiographic studies showed left ventricular and left auricular enlargement. The aorta was tortuous and calcified. The right leaf of the diaphragm was elevated but on fluoroscopic examination moved as well as the left. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were prominent features. A barium enema was unsatisfactory because of the patient's inability to retain sufficient barium; however, diverticula were demonstrated in the sigmoid region, and the cecum was high-placed. A gastrointestinal series revealed no esophageal varices. A small hiatus hernia was present. No intrinsic abnormality of the stomach, duodenal bulb or duodenal loop was present. The duodenal loop was not enlarged. A small-bowel series was not remarkable, except for one segment of atonic bowel on the three-hour film. It was also noted that the bones were atrophic with fairly marked degenerative changes\nA sigmoidoscope was passed to 13 cm., with great difficulty. The bowel was very spastic and was intensely hyperemic.\nThe temperature remained elevated in irregular fashion, reaching 104\u00b0F. on the first, sixth and seventh hospital days, dropping to 99\u00b0F. and below on the eighth and ninth days, and becoming elevated again, gradually reaching 104\u00b0F. on the fourteenth day, normal on the fifteenth day and up to 104\u00b0F. again on the twenty-second and twenty-third days. Although the patient was reluctant to take food and refused to force fluids, she was kept well hydrated, and the caloric intake increased by frequent prompting. It was noted on one occasion that appetite increased, and the patient was subjectively better coincident with a high rise in temperature. Therapeutic measures consisted mainly of Digitoxin, 0.15 mg. daily, Crysticillin, 300,000 units daily, Hykinone, 4.8 mg. daily, and dihydro-streptomycin, 1.0 gm. daily, as well as supportive and antipyretic measures. Mercuhydrin was given on occasion. The patient's general condition grew steadily worse. On the fifteenth hospital day abdominal distention had become an increasingly prominent feature, being only somewhat relieved by enemas and stupes.\nA liver biopsy on the twenty-first day was reported as follows:\nThe portal areas show increase in the number of small-bile ducts and a moderately severe inflammatory reaction in which polymorphonuclears are numerous. Small cholangioles are dilated, and there are foci of pseudotubular change in the liver cords. Two foci of necrosis and degeneration of liver cells are seen. No inspissation of bile in thecholangioles or canaliculi is seen, and there is no bile pigmentation in the liver cells. The findings nevertheless, suggest obstruction in the extrahepatic biliary tract.\nOn the twenty-fifth day it was noted that the jaundice had deepened, and the liver edge was only 4 cm. below the costal margin. Stupor increased, and the patient died quietly, without change in the vital signs, on the twenty-sixth hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Alfred L. Duncombe\\*: May we see the x-ray films?Dr. Stanley M. Wyman: The film of the chest taken in the upright position shows the heart to be considerably enlarged to the left, probably in the region of the left ventricle. The tortuous, calcified aorta is well seen, and also the elevation of the right leaf of the diaphragm. This appears to be rather localized anteriorly and probably represents localized enlargement of the liver in this region. The spleen is greatly enlarged, extending down to the crest of the ilium, and there are a number of round calcific shadows overlying the spleen suggesting phleboliths in the spleen itself.The kidney shadows are not adequately seen on any film, but they may be small. One film of the attempted barium enema shows nothing remarkable except for diverticula in the sigmoid. The films from the gastrointestinal series show some pressure on the lesser-curvature aspect of the stomach, with depression of the duodenal bulb downward. This is well seen in the spot film. The esophagus itself is quite well demonstrated, and there is no evidence of varices. There is no evidence of pressure on the second portion of the duodenum in its medial aspect. The stasis in the small bowel, I think, may be accounted for by the patient's large hernia, which is seen at this point.Dr. Duncombe: Will you comment on the barium swallow?Dr. Wyman: It outlines an essentially normal esophagus, which is pushed backward by the enlarged heart.Dr. Duncombe: The problem is that of a woman with painless jaundice of a number of weeks' duration, following a period of increasing poor health, which went on to a rather rapidly fatal termination.There are several things in the past history that should be mentioned and disposed of. The diagnosis of pernicious anemia was made twenty-five years before admission \u2014 incidentally, that was two years ahead of the publication of Dr. Minot's paper. Perhaps it is an error in the history. She probably did not have pernicious anemia at any time. Her blood picture was not that of pernicious anemia and the bone-marrow biopsy did not show the findings of pernicious anemia. She had a toxic goiter removed six years previously, with weight loss of some 50 or 60 pounds since that time. The possibility of recurrent thyrotoxicosis should be considered, but there is no other evidence for it.Then she was known to have had heart disease of some type for a few years. The heart was enlargedchiefly in the region of the left ventricle. She was fibrillating. There was no history of hypertension. Her blood pressure in the hospital was low \u2014 92 systolic, 48 diastolic. The electrocardiogram is of no value in the diagnosis of the heart disease but confirms the presence of fibrillation. She had a relatively loud systolic murmur heard best at the lower border of the sternum. This murmur is consistent with disease of the aortic valve in a person who has developed failure and a fall in blood pressure and is acutely ill. I think it most likely that the autopsy showed disease of the aortic valve and a large left ventricle.Is it possible that the heart disease was a major factor in her present hospital admission? It seems unlikely. She had a fever. She went downhill rapidly. The blood culture was negative. It seems unlikely that subacute bacterial endocarditis should be seriously considered. Disposing of the three things in the past history, we have to consider the problem of painless jaundice at the age of sixty-nine. Perhaps the most important of the x-ray findings is the presence of a large spleen. This was questionably palpable, but the x-ray examination confirms that there was a large spleen. Dr. Jones said earlier this morning at Medical Grand Rounds that a large liver and large spleen in the presence of jaundice means that there must be intrinsic liver disease, and not obstructive jaundice. Extrahepatic obstruction should not give this large spleen.Before dismissing the possibility of biliary obstruction, one would have briefly to consider carcinoma of the head of the pancreas and carcinoma of the bile duct or of the ampulla of Vater with resultant damage to the liver. Against carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is the absence of a positive guaiac reaction in the stool. The majority of cases should have blood in the stool. Certainly, a commonduct stone can produce jaundice, a large liver and intermittent fever and can go on to a fatal termination without any significant degree of pain, but we have already concluded from the presence of a large spleen that the primary difficulty was within the liver.What type of liver disease could she have had that would end up with this clinical picture and fatal termination? There was no history that suggests the usual etiologic factor in producing alcoholic cirrhosis. Apparently, the patient had been a neurotic type of person. She may well have had a poor diet, but she certainly was not alcoholic. The possibility of biliary cirrhosis should be considered. The usual term \"Hanot's cirrhosis\" is confusing. It apparently has been a catch-all for a number of poorly understood conditions. In recent years it has been shown that following virus infections of the liver, chronic hepatitis, progressing to a type of biliary cirrhosis that is consistent with this clinical picture, can develop.The laboratory findings, as so often happens in the presence of jaundice, are confusing. At least they are to me. She had bile in her stools because they were not clay colored on admission, and there is no mention of clay-colored stools later on. She had normal urobilinogen in the stools and only moderately elevated urobilinogen in the urine. This indicates that there was not a high degree of extrahepatic obstruction. The alkaline phosphatase, being moderately elevated and rising, is suggestive of extrahepatic obstruction. The cephalin-flocculation test was strongly positive, suggesting a considerable degree of liver damage. The cholesterol was very low, as were the cholesterol esters. These indicate severe hepatic damage rather than extrahepatic obstruction.I am sure the problem on the ward was whether this was extrahepatic or parenchymatous jaundice. Finally, a biopsy was done, which I do not believe can completely answer the question. There was evidence of proliferation of the small bile ducts and an inflammatory reaction, but inspissation of bile in the cholangioles that would ordinarily be seen in extrahepatic obstruction was not present. However, to the pathologist, the findings suggested obstruction in the extrahepatic biliary tract. In spite of that, I believe that the primary difficulty must have been within the liver and that she had some type of cirrhosis, probably biliary cirrhosis.The other problem is the high, localized elevation of the diaphragm, which raises the question whether this woman had developed a hepatoma. The biopsy did not show it, but it could well have been missed and I think the pathologist is the only one who can answer that.A Physician: Does the fact that the liver border went down from 11 cm. to 4 cm. mean anything to you?Dr. Duncombe: I think that it suggests an acute or subacute infection of the liver with cirrhotic changes of the type that has been described following virus infection.A Physician: Would you comment on the peculiar fever that this woman ran?Dr. Duncombe: There was some statement here that meant nothing to me. It was noted on one occasion that her general sense of well-being and appetite improved with the high fever. People with severe liver disease and particularly people with cancer in the liver can have a high, irregular, septic temperature, and I assume that it is on the basis of severe liver disease, possibly with a hepatoma.Dr. Richard J. Clark: Would you consider cholangitis in itself as possibly being the background?Dr. Duncombe: Whatever the terminal illness causing jaundice of six weeks' duration, some difficulty had been present for some months previous to that period. I do not see how one can rule that in or out completely.Dr. Tracy B. Mallory: The discharge diagnosis from the wards was subacute atrophy of the liver. I wonder whether there is anyone who wishes to defend that?Dr. Benjamin Castleman: I believe they made that diagnosis because the liver shrank so rapidly. At least the same examiner thought so.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Mallory: At autopsy we found that the liver certainly could not have shrunken much in size because it was still very large, weighing 2520 gm. The apparent shrinkage was due essentially to elevation of the diaphragm.A large gallstone was found in the common bile duct just above the ampulla, an adequate cause for the development of an obstructive biliary cirrhosis. With further dissection we found that the biliary tree had spontaneously drained itself, that the gall bladder had become a narrow tube with thick fibrous walls but that the cystic duct was dilated to equal diameter and a fistula had developed between the cystic duct and the duodenum. Evidently, drainage had been re-established after a very prolonged period of obstruction of the common duct. At the time of autopsy the inflammatory infiltration in the liver had become more impressive than it was in the biopsy. Either it had extended or perhaps the biopsy was not representative. The surface of the liver was quite finely granular, and the tissue was very firm, and cut with a great deal of difficulty.The spleen was very large, weighing around 800 gm., and showed on microscopical examination minimal but, I believe, distinct changes suggesting portal hypertension. This is the Banti type of spleen, something that is very rarely seen with a biliary cirrhosis, only with one of very long standing.The heart was much enlarged, weighing 600 gm., and we could find no reason for it other than an accumulation of a great deal of pericardial fat. There were no valvular lesions, no coronary-artery narrowing, no myocarditis and no evidence that the patient had ever had hypertension. Although heart disease must have been present, I cannot give it a name and say what kind it was.\n",

      "question": "A 46-year-old man was seen in the neurology clinic because of hemiparesis, aphasia, and abnormalities on neuroimaging studies.\nThe patient had been well, except for migraine headaches, until 4 years earlier, when right-sided weakness, clumsiness, and slurred speech developed during a period of 24 hours. A neurologist at another hospital found dysarthria and right central facial weakness; decreased muscle tone in the right arm, with strength 4+/5; and normal muscle tone in the right leg, with strength 4+/5. Strength on the left side was normal, with slightly increased tone in the left arm and normal tone in the left leg. Reflexes were brisker on the right side than on the left, with an extensor plantar response on the right and a flexor plantar response on the left. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain after the administration of contrast material showed numerous nonenhancing, hypodense lesions in the bilateral basal ganglia and deep white matter. The patient was admitted to that hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive nonenhancing hyperintense lesions in the basal ganglia and deep white matter on T\n2\n-weighted images. The white-cell count was 13,600 cells per cubic millimeter (neutrophils, 11,800 cells per cubic millimeter), and the thyrotropin level was 0.11 \u03bcIU per milliliter (reference range, 0.49 to 4.67). Other test results, including hematocrit, platelet count, coagulation studies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tests of liver and renal function, and measurements of calcium, glucose, thyroxine, antinuclear antibody, anticardiolipin antibody, vitamin B\n12\n, folate, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and very-long-chain fatty acids, were normal. Testing for Lyme disease was negative.\nDuring the next 4 days, the patient's symptoms worsened, and dysphagia developed. Methylprednisolone was given intravenously, and he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital on the fourth day. Testing of visual, somatosensory, and brain-stem auditory evoked potentials was normal. MRI of the cervical spine after the administration of contrast material revealed no impingement on the spinal cord or intrinsic lesions. The dysphagia gradually improved; his right arm remained paretic and its tone increased.\nFour months after discharge, interferon beta-1a (30 \u03bcg weekly by intramuscular injections) was begun. Four days after the first injection, the dysarthria suddenly worsened, and expressive aphasia developed. The patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital. Repeat MRI of the brain after the administration of gadolinium revealed progression of the previously seen left-sided lesions and a new lesion near the posterior limb of the left internal capsule. He was discharged home later that day. Injections of interferon beta-1a were continued. Lumbar puncture was performed 2 months later. The cerebrospinal fluid contained 1 white cell per cubic millimeter; the protein level was 26 mg per deciliter and the glucose 67 mg per deciliter; there were no oligoclonal bands, and the IgG index and level of myelin basic protein were normal.\nDuring the next 2 years, three additional exacerbations of the patient's symptoms occurred, which improved after treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone; interferon beta-1a was discontinued; and glatiramer acetate was begun daily by subcutaneous injection. Severe fatigue developed, and modafinil was prescribed.\nThe patient came to the outpatient neurology clinic of this hospital for a fifth opinion on the diagnosis and management of his symptoms. He reported dysarthria, dysphasia, dysphagia, weakness and spasticity of the right arm and leg, and severe fatigue, but no bladder symptoms. Since his mid-20s, he had had migraine headaches without aura, which were hemicranial, on alternating sides, and associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia, without osmophobia; they occurred four to five times per year and lasted between 4 and 6 hours. He took ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid for the pain. There was no history of an elevated cholesterol level, hypertension, diabetes, blood clots, rashes, or joint pain. He had smoked and ingested alcohol in the past, but stopped both 15 years earlier; he did not use illicit drugs. He had no allergies to medications; his current medications included glatiramer acetate, baclofen, and modafinil. He was married, had no children, and had worked as a carpenter until becoming disabled by this illness. He was of German, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. His parents, three of his four brothers, his sister, and two nephews had migraine headaches. His 75-year-old mother had had a transient ischemic attack at 64 years of age; his 80-year-old father was deaf. Two brothers carried a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis; one (48 years of age) had cognitive and word-finding problems, and the other (50 years of age) had arm spasms and difficulty speaking. Two other brothers (47 and 52 years of age) had psoriasis; a fifth brother had had mental retardation and died at 4 years of age from pneumonia. A paternal uncle had died of a stroke.\nOn examination, the vital signs were normal. The patient was alert and oriented. His score on the Mini\u2013Mental State Examination was 28 out of 30, with two errors recalling three objects at 5 minutes. He had a mild expressive aphasia, and his speech was dysarthric. Visual acuity and fields were normal; the pupils were symmetric and equally reactive to light, and there was no afferent pupillary defect. Disk margins were sharp, and there was nystagmus at extreme gaze. There was mild right central facial weakness. Muscle bulk was normal. Strength was 4/5 in the right deltoid, wrist extensors, and wrist flexors and 4+/5 in the biceps and triceps muscles. The right leg was spastic; strength was 4+/5 in the iliopsoas and normal in the quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemius muscles. The left arm and leg had normal power; tone was increased in the arm and normal in the leg. The reflexes were 3+/5 in both arms and legs. Plantar responses were extensor on the right side and flexor on the left side. The gait was hemiparetic. Coordination was normal in the left arm and both legs; the right arm could not be assessed because of paralysis. The sensory examination and the remainder of the physical examination were normal. Examination by a neuro-ophthalmologist disclosed no optic-nerve abnormalities.\nA CT angiogram of the head and neck showed no evidence of atherosclerotic disease. Results of a repeat MRI scan of the brain were similar to those 3 years earlier, except for a slight increase in the extent of hyperintense lesions on T\n2\n-weighted images. MRI scans from the patient's two brothers who carried a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis were reviewed, and they showed findings similar to those of the patient. Testing of visual evoked potentials elicited normal results. The level of functional protein C was 153% (reference range, 70 to 140); the cholesterol level was 243 mg per deciliter (6 mmol per liter) (desirable, <200 mg per deciliter [<5 mmol per liter]); other test results, including a test for resistance to activated protein C, a complete blood count, tests of renal function, and measurements of lipoprotein A, electrolytes, glucose, calcium, lactic acid, thyrotropin, vitamin B\n12\n, creatine kinase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, arylsulfatase A, phytanic acid, very-long-chain fatty acids, protein S (functional assay), antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and\nBorrelia burgdorferi,\nantinuclear antibody, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, antithrombin III, and homocysteine, were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed 1 white cell, normal levels of protein (26 mg per deciliter) and glucose (67 mg per deciliter [3.7 mmol per liter]), and a normal IgG index (<0.85); no oligoclonal bands were noted. Sequencing of exons 1 through 33 of the\nNOTCH3\ngene showed a mutation of unknown significance at codon 61, resulting in a substitution of arginine for tryptophan in the putative gene protein product; this mutation had not previously been associated with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). The patient reported that testing of one of his brothers for mutations in the\nNOTCH3\ngene had been negative. Genetic testing for mitochondrial encephalomyelopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) was negative.\nA diagnostic test was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Steven D. Brass:* This 46-year-old man with a history of migraine had recurrent acute neurologic events over a period of a few years. Examination revealed cognitive changes, aphasia, and hemiparesis, and neuroimaging revealed multifocal abnormalities in the basal ganglia and white matter. His family history was clinically significant for two brothers who carried a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. He came to me for a second opinion, with a presumptive diagnosis of multiple sclerosis; I am aware of the final diagnosis in this case. Dr. Copen, may we review the neuroimaging studies?*Dr. William A. Copen:* MRI of the brain performed at another institution 4 years before presentation at this hospital revealed extensive deep supratentorial white-matter lesions that are most prominent in T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images ([Figure 1A](#f01)). The lesions were hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with no associated mass effect or enhancement and no susceptibility effect to suggest hemorrhage. Images of the cervical spine showed mild degenerative changes but no spinal cord abnormalities. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck was normal.The patient's brain lesions could be consistent with multiple sclerosis, although several features are unusual for that diagnosis. In multiple sclerosis, the corpus callosum typically has disproportionately more lesions than do other white-matter structures; however, the corpus callosum is largely spared in this patient ([Figure 1B](#f01)). Second, the patient has lesions in deep gray-matter structures, and MRI reveals deep gray-matter lesions in only a minority of patients with multiple sclerosis ([Figure 1C](#f01)). Third, there are extensive regions of cavitation, with resulting signal suppression on FLAIR images; such widespread cavitation is unusual in multiple sclerosis. Finally, one lesion shows markedly restricted water diffusion ([Figure 1D](#f01)). Although diffusion is often decreased in lesions of active multiple sclerosis, restriction of this degree is more typical of recent infarction. Therefore, in addition to multiple sclerosis, the differential diagnosis for these findings must include small-vessel vasculitides, as well as other pathologic processes that could result in deep infarcts, such as hypercoagulable states and inheritable or drug-induced small-vessel arteriopathies.At a follow-up visit, the patient had with him the MRI scans from the two brothers who carried diagnoses of multiple sclerosis. These images showed findings remarkably similar to those in the patient, including widespread supratentorial hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images, which predominantly, but not exclusively, affected white matter. In the brothers, involvement of the deep gray-matter structures was more pronounced than that in the patient, further suggesting an inheritable disease capable of causing small-vessel infarction ([Figure 2](#f02)).\n### Multiple Sclerosis\n\n*Dr. Brass:* Multiple sclerosis is a challenging diagnosis to make and carries a misdiagnosis rate of 5 to 10%.[1](#core-r001) The diagnosis relies on the presence of lesions in the central nervous system that are disseminated in space (i.e., various parts of the central nervous system) and time, with no better explanation for the disease process. MRI of the brain and spine, cerebrospinal fluid examination, and tests of visual evoked potentials may also help confirm the diagnosis. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis necessitates the exclusion of alternative diagnoses.[2](#core-r002) For this reason, evaluation should include careful consideration of red flags, which are features in the history, examination, or diagnostic tests that are not typical or suggestive of multiple sclerosis[1,3\u201310](#core-r001) ([Table 1](#t01)). If multiple red flags are present, further diagnostic tests may be indicated to look for one of the many mimics of multiple sclerosis. This patient had multiple red flags, including his acute strokelike events, his history of two first-degree relatives who carried diagnoses of multiple sclerosis, his personal and family history of migraine, his aphasia as an early presenting symptom, the absence of optic-nerve involvement and sensory symptoms on examination, the predominant gray-matter involvement and the sparing of the corpus callosum on MRI, the normal results on testing of visual evoked potentials, and the absence of oligoclonal bands and the normal IgG index on cerebrospinal fluid examination. These features mandated consideration of other diagnoses.\n### Other Possible Multifocal White-Matter Lesions\n\nOf the many diseases that can present with multifocal white-matter lesions, infectious diseases such as Lyme disease, HIV encephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and neurosyphilis; metabolic conditions such as vitamin B12 deficiency; toxic leukoencephalopathy; and inflammatory and immunologic diseases such as Beh\u00e7et's disease, vasculitis of the central nervous system, antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome, and neurosarcoidosis are unlikely in view of the patient's clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings and his family history. I therefore focused on the three most probable diagnoses: leukodystrophies, mitochondrial diseases, and CADASIL.\n### Leukodystrophies\n\nAlthough most leukodystrophies present in childhood, some variants can present in adulthood, and they include adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, leukodystrophy with neuroaxonal spheroids, and galactocerebrosidase deficiencies such as Krabbe's disease. However, leukodystrophies usually follow a slowly progressive course, rather than a relapsing\u2013remitting one, and despite the family history of two brothers with white-matter disease, the patient's clinical findings and neuroimaging studies did not conform to any of these entities. The normal values for very-long-chain fatty acids also argued strongly against adrenoleukodystrophy.\n### Mitochondrial Diseases\n\nMitochondrial diseases can mimic multiple sclerosis by presenting with relapsing disease of the central nervous system. We considered MELAS in this case because of the family history, strokelike episodes, headache, and cognitive problems. MRI in cases of MELAS often reveals infarcts in the cortical and subcortical white matter that do not follow vascular territories. Although the MRI scans in this case were not supportive of a diagnosis of MELAS, this patient's constellation of clinical features compelled us to perform genetic testing for MELAS.[11](#core-r011) The results did not reveal the most common mitochondrial DNA point mutation associated with MELAS and prompted us to explore other possible diagnoses.\n### CADASIL\n\nCADASIL is an autosomal dominant disease that would explain many features of this case, since it typically presents with the onset of lacunar stroke in the fifth or early sixth decade of life[12,13](#core-r012) and additional lacunar strokes and ischemic damage to the white matter ultimately lead to dementia after about 10 years. About a third of the patients have migraine, as this patient did; migraine, if present, typically begins in the middle of the fourth decade. Neuroimaging often reveals multifocal or symmetric white-matter lesions, classically involving the anterior temporal lobe and external capsule.[12,14](#core-r012) In our patient, however, no temporal-lobe involvement was seen on the MRI scans.[15](#core-r015)Nonetheless, since two of the patient's brothers had white-matter disease, we ordered genetic testing for CADASIL, which showed a missense mutation in the *NOTCH3* gene at nucleotide position 259 that would predict a change from arginine to tryptophan. One of the brothers had been tested for a *NOTCH3* mutation, and although the patient reported that the test was negative, we later learned that the brother had the same missense alteration at nucleotide position 259. Since most mutations described in patients with CADASIL have been missense mutations that result in the addition or removal of cysteines from the epidermal growth factor (EGF)\u2013like repeats of Notch3, presumably altering the secondary conformation of the Notch3 protein, the significance of this change was not clear.[16](#core-r016) Since the imaging findings suggested the possibility of small-vessel disease and infarction, I sought additional input from Dr. Smith, then at the hospital's Stroke Service.*Dr. Eric E. Smith:* The subcortical parenchymal lesions on MRI and CT in this patient suggest the presence of a small-vessel vasculopathy. The subcortical white and gray matter are perfused by arteries, 50 to 500 \u03bcm in diameter, that penetrate centrally into the brain parenchyma after arising from the larger circumferential arteries on the brain surface. Because the size of these vessels is below the limit of spatial resolution of in vivo angiography, the presence of cerebral small-vessel disease must be inferred by the characteristic pattern of tissue lesions, rather than by direct observation of the vessels.Diseases that affect small cerebral arteries and need to be considered in this case include arteriosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, vasculitis, and hereditary vasculopathies. Arteriosclerosis, often associated with aging and hypertension, is overall the most common small-vessel disease, but it is unlikely in this patient because of his age and the lack of typical risk factors, except for a remote history of smoking and the presence of hyperlipidemia. Sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy is unlikely because of the patient's young age and the lack of characteristic lobar intracerebral hemorrhages.[17](#core-r017) Cerebral vasculitides are improbable because of the long time course, absence of signs of systemic vasculitis, and absence of pleocytosis or elevated protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. The most likely cause of the patient's disease is therefore an adult-onset hereditary vasculopathy. The neurologic symptoms, family history, and strikingly similar MRI lesions in the patient and two of his brothers are consistent with an autosomal dominant inherited disease. The lack of neurologic symptoms in the parents may indicate partial or incomplete penetrance.Hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathies are caused by mutations in various genes, including amyloid precursor protein, cystatin C, gelsolin, and transthyretin.[18](#core-r018) Lobar intracerebral hemorrhages, including microhemorrhages detected with the use of MRI, are characteristic, as they are in sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Mutations in the *COL4A1* gene encoding the \u03b11 chain of type IV collagen cause basement-membrane abnormalities and are associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, porencephaly, intracranial aneurysms, and cystic kidney disease.[19](#core-r019) Both hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy and *COL4A1-*associated disease are unlikely in this case because of the absence of intracerebral hemorrhages and the prominent cavitating lacunar lesions.Fabry's disease is an X-linked recessive disease caused by mutations in the *GLA* gene encoding \u03b1-galactosidase A, leading to accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in the vascular media and other tissues. Although Fabry's disease is an under-recognized cause of ischemic stroke in younger persons,[20](#core-r020) the absence of angiokeratoma, small-fiber neuropathy, and cardiac abnormalities makes that diagnosis unlikely.Homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in one of four genes that are involved in methionine metabolism; the classic form is caused by mutations in the *CBS* gene encoding cystathionine \u03b2-synthase. Accelerated atherosclerosis, large-vessel and small-vessel ischemic infarcts, and extensive white-matter lesions may be seen.[21](#core-r021) In this case, homocystinuria is ruled out by the normal serum homocysteine level.The signs and symptoms in this case most closely resemble the phenotype of CADASIL. The extensive lacunar lesions and white-matter lesions seen on MRI in this case are consistent with CADASIL. However, the mutation in *NOTCH3* identified in this case is not typical of those that cause CADASIL.[14](#core-r014) This raised the question of whether the observed mutation causes disease or is merely a coincidental polymorphism. Other findings in this case that cast some doubt on the diagnosis of CADASIL are the lack of symptomatic disease in either parent, despite the reported high penetrance of CADASIL, and the relative lack of characteristic anterior temporal white-matter lesions.[15](#core-r015) The possibility of a new small-vessel disease with a CADASIL-like phenotype, as has recently been described,[22](#core-r022) must be considered as an alternative diagnosis.We were therefore faced with the question of determining the pathogenic relevance of a previously undescribed genetic mutation. This situation may become more frequent in cases of CADASIL and other diseases as molecular diagnostic testing becomes more commonplace. To determine definitively whether the CADASIL phenotype was present, we recommended obtaining a skin-biopsy specimen for pathological examination of the small dermal arteries. Dermal arteries show pathological findings that are pathognomonic for CADASIL, even though skin lesions do not occur. The sensitivity and specificity of a skin-biopsy specimen for the diagnosis of CADASIL are both greater than 90%, provided that dermal arteries can be adequately visualized in the specimen.[23](#core-r023)Before the patient could undergo a skin biopsy, however, his brother who had the same *NOTCH3* alteration died of a stroke. An autopsy was performed.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Matthew P. Frosch:* An autopsy limited to examination of the central nervous system was performed on the patient's brother at another institution, and the brain was delivered to this hospital. The brain weighed 1390 g and showed evidence of a recent, large infarct in the left hemisphere involving the striatum and extending to the external capsule ([Figure 3A](#f03)). The gross appearance and the microscopical findings of early accumulation of macrophages at the edges of the infarct suggested that the lesion was approximately 7 to 10 days old. The overall macroscopic appearance and consistency of the white matter were normal, but microscopical examination revealed a series of small infarcts in the brain stem and in the contralateral basal ganglia. These ranged in age from remote to recent. In addition, many medium-sized vessels showed marked thickening of their walls, associated with granular deposits and increased space between the vessel and the surrounding parenchyma ([Figure 3B](#f03)). These granular deposits in the vessel walls were strongly stained with the periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) method ([Figure 3C](#f03)). Ultrastructural examination of the vessels of the white matter showed the presence of granular osmiophilic material along the abluminal aspect of the vascular basement membrane ([Figure 3D](#f03)). The combination of the light-microscopical findings of the changes in blood-vessel walls, including the PAS-positive granular deposits, and the presence of granular osmiophilic material as detected on electron microscopy is diagnostic of CADASIL.*Dr. Joseph F. Arboleda-Velasquez:* The *NOTCH3* C259T mutation that was found in the patient and his brother is predicted to result in a nonconservative amino acid change of arginine to tryptophan at position 61 (R61W) of the Notch3 protein, a member of a family of transmembrane receptors that coordinate cell-fate decisions during development.[24\u201326](#core-r024) The R61W change, like all other CADASIL mutations reported to date, is positioned in 1 of the 34 EGF-like repeats located in the extracellular domain of Notch3.[14,27](#core-r014) However, in contrast to typical CADASIL mutations, this change does not result in an EGF-like repeat that contains an odd number of cysteine residues.[16,28,29](#core-r016) The presence of presumably free sulfhydryl moieties in Notch3 proteins carrying typical changes of CADASIL has triggered proposals about the effect of the mutations on signaling, folding, trafficking, and increased reactivity of the receptor, but efforts to address these issues experimentally have not produced conclusive results.[30\u201335](#core-r030) Several Notch3 alterations that do not affect cysteine residues have been reported in families with CADASIL,[36\u201340](#core-r036) although the effects of these changes on Notch3 activity and their ability to induce the vascular pathology of CADASIL are also unclear ([Table 2](#t02)). Thus, whether the R61W change in Notch3 in this family resulted in molecular aberrations leading or contributing to the small-vessel disease requires further investigation.*Dr. David N. Louis* (Pathology): Dr. Viswanathan, what is the patient's current condition?*Dr. Anand Viswanathan* (Neurology): The patient has remained neurologically stable without clinical or imaging evidence of new stroke. He continues on aspirin therapy with aggressive efforts to control blood pressure to reduce disease-related disability and cognitive impairment.\n",

      "question": "First admission.\nA seventeen-year-old girl entered the hospital because of pain in the abdomen.\nShe had been well until the previous evening, when there was the onset of crampy pain in the lower portion of the abdomen. On the following day the pain intensified and became localized in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Several hours before admission pain in the right shoulder developed. Rectal pain occurred when she strained during a bowel movement. The menses began on the day before entry, one week early; the last preceding menstrual period had started twenty-two days previously.\nPhysical examination was negative except for tenderness, rebound tenderness and guarding in both lower quadrants of the abdomen, especially on the left side. On rectal examination marked tenderness in the left vaginal vault was elicited on motion of the cervix.\nThe temperature was 100.6\u00b0F., the pulse 90, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 120 systolic, 80 diastolic.\nThe urinary sediment contained an occasional red and white cell per high-power field. A pregnancy test was negative. The hemoglobin was 10.4 gm. per 100 ml., and the white-cell count was 19,200, with 66 per cent neutrophils. X-ray films of the chest were normal. On a film of the abdomen a soft-tissue mass in the left side of the pelvis was suggested.\nDuring the first hospital day the abdominal pain migrated toward the periumbilical region and became more severe; the hemoglobin fell to 8.6 gm. per 100 ml. Exploratory laparotomy revealed 750 ml. of fresh and clotted blood within the abdominal cavity. The uterus, left ovary and left fallopian tube were normal; the right ovary was enlarged, with a steady ooze of bright-red blood from a cystic structure. The cyst was excised, and two small cysts floating in the blood and the appendix were also removed. Microscopical examination disclosed a cystic corpus luteum, a normal appendix and peritoneal inclusion cysts with squamous metaplasia. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on the eleventh hospital day.\nSecond admission\n(four and a half years later). She was well in the interval until three weeks before admission, when she experienced the sudden onset of sharp pain in the lower portion of the abdomen that was aggravated by moving and by coughing. The pain subsided four days later and did not recur. Examination shortly before entry disclosed a mass in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. The last menstrual period began three days before the onset of the pain and was normal. There were no symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal or urinary tract.\nPhysical examination revealed a well developed young woman who did not appear ill. The lungs and heart were normal. The abdomen was soft and nontender. A mobile mass the size of a grapefruit was felt in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen; the cervix was not tender, and the uterus was retroflexed: the vaults and the rectum were normal.\nThe temperature was 98.2\u00b0F., the pulse 80, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 120 systolic, 80 diastolic.\nUrinalysis was negative. The hemoglobin was 13.4 gm. per 100 ml, and the white-cell count was 8000. X-ray films of the chest were normal. An intravenous pyelographic study disclosed a large soft-tissue mass in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, containing faint, irregular calcific densities within its central portion. The excretory passages on the left side appeared normal; on the right side the ureter was poorly seen but appeared displaced medially. A barium-enema examination (\nFig. 1\n) revealed a mass situated to the right of the cecum, displacing it medially and anteriorly.\nAn operation was performed on the second hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nDr. Robert E. Scully: Four years ago Dr. Green discussed the first admission of this patient at one of these exercises[1](#core-r001) and made the correct diagnosis. When she re-entered with a second diagnostic problem, therefore, he became the logical choice to solve it again.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Thomas H. Green, Jr.\\*: The doctrine of double jeopardy apparently does not apply to clinicopathological conferences!I can think of only three reasons for the presentation of this patient's second problem. One is that the process underlying the recent illness was related to either the disorder that occasioned the first admission or its treatment. Secondly, the recounting of the earlier illness may be a diabolical method of introducing a \"red herring\" or two. Thirdly, the disease at the time of the first admission may have been the only one that was gynecologic, and the events leading to the second entry may belong in another category. Nevertheless, as gynecologists and pelvic surgeons we are interested in any mass in the lower portion of the abdomen.To recapitulate, the first admission was preceded by the symptoms of an acute process in the pelvis that probably was associated with leakage, presumably of blood, into the peritoneal cavity. The physical findings were typical of a pelvic vascular accident, with bleeding into the peritoneal cavity, and slight elevation of the temperature occasionally results from the presence of the blood. The bleeding must have been slow since she was not in shock, and it may have ceased by the time of entry. The negative pregnancy test did not exclude the possibility of pregnancy, of course, since only 40 to 50 per cent of ectopic pregnancies are associated with a positive test. During the first hospital day the pain migrated toward the periumbilical region and became more severe. The hemoglobin level fell further to 8.6 gm. per 100 ml., suggesting recurrence of the bleeding, and exploration revealed almost a liter of blood in the abdominal cavity. A cyst of the right ovary had ruptured, and one is surprised to learn that although most of the symptoms had been on the left side the right ovary was the diseased organ. However, the mass that was seen in the x-ray films was undoubtedly blood clot, and I assume that the blood gravitated into the left vault and the lower portion of the abdomen, causing the pain there. The cyst proved to be a corpus-luteum cyst, consistent with the fact that she was in the premenstrual phase of the cycle at the time. The appendectomy may be significant with respect to the second admission. The discovery of two small peritoneal inclusion cysts may also be a clue to the nature of the subsequent events, but I am inclined to doubt their significance. We occasionally encounter such cysts lying in the cul-de-sac, but it is my belief that they are seldom retroperitoneal, whereas the chances are great that the lesion responsible for the second admission was in the retroperitoneum.The history is consistent with a retroperitoneal tumor, which usually remains unrecognized until the patient or her physician notices a mass. Furthermore, the absence of symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal or urinary tract is more compatible with a retroperitoneal than an intraperitoneal or pelvic tumor, since retroperitoneal masses are notorious for not causing symptoms until they grow to be of large size, and some of them do become tremendous. The first description of a retroperitoneal tumor, credited to Morgagni in 1761, concerned a huge lipoma that was almost larger than the patient, and there are many drawings in ancient medical treatises illustrating massive retroperitoneal tumors such as giant lipomas and fibromas. One wonders to what extent the mass that was felt in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen was truly mobile, as described in the report of the physical examination, in view of its apparent retroperitoneal location. It would be interesting to know whether the mass was cystic or solid, smoothly rounded or nodular, irregular or regular.Dr. Scully: The patient's physician described it only as a slightly tender, long, cylindrical mass in the right iliac fossa. When palpated through the rectal wall the cervix was nontender and could be moved painlessly with the remainder of the uterus. The ovaries could not be felt, and the abdominal mass seemed to be out of the pelvis and unrelated to the right ovary.Dr. Green: If the right ovary had been palpated and seemed normal, we could completely exclude a lesion arising at that site.An intravenous pyelographic study disclosed a soft-tissue mass lying within the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. It contained faint, irregular calcific densities within its central portion, and this may be the most important clue that we've had so far. This seems an appropriate time to see the x-ray films taken on this admission.Dr. Douglass H. Howry: On the films taken on the first admission the chest appears normal. The film of the abdomen demonstrates a soft-tissue density in the pelvis and absence of the retroperitoneal fat lines.On the films taken during the recent admission some of the gas-filled loops of bowel are displaced markedly in a medial direction. I reviewed all the films with a bright light and was unable to find the calcium that was described. There are a few small, faint shadows that might have suggested calcification to one radiologist, but I doubt that it was present. A retroperitoneal location of the mass is indicated by the absence of the psoas-muscle shadow on the right side. We have to consider an infectious process in the kidney or osteomyelitis of the spine as the origin of a psoas abscess. However, the bones are normal, with no evidence of osteomyelitis. and the intravenous pyelographic study shows no evidence of renal infection. The mass does not appear to be associated with the female pelvic organs. The films from the barium-enema examination reveal medial displacement of the cecum and the ascending colon by the mass ([Fig. 1](#f001)), and the ascending colon is also displaced anteriorly. The right ureter is displaced medially.Dr. Green: I was banking heavily on the presence of calcification in my analysis of this problem. The films demonstrate the retroperitoneal location of the mass very nicely. I don't see how an intraperitoneal mass could displace the ascending colon anteriorly and medially and also push the ureter medially, as this lesion did. The uterus appears anteverted rather than retroflexed, and there doesn't seem to be any connection between the uterus or the adnexa and the mass in the right iliac fossa. However, a retroperitoneal tumor can arise from the female genital organs. Last week I explored a young woman who had a mass that felt cystic, was palpable in the upper portion of the abdomen and appeared to be an ovarian cyst. At operation I found that both fallopian tubes and ovaries were normal, but there was a huge broad-ligament mass that proved to be a very edematous fibroid attached over a small area to the uterus. It had displaced the ureter laterally rather than medially. Gray[2](#core-r002) recently reported removing a 47-pound broad-ligament fibroid of uterine origin that was located retroperitoneally. An ovarian tumor can also be confused with a retroperitoneal mass. We have seen 1 patient with a cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary whose intravenous pyelograms had shown displacement of the ureter in a manner suggesting a retroperitoneal tumor because of extension of the tumor into the broad ligament. So we must keep in mind the possibility of a leiomyoma of the broad ligament as well as an ovarian lesion with a retroperitoneal location.If it had been ascertained that the mass contained calcific deposits, one of the first diagnoses to be considered would be a retroperitoneal teratoma or dermoid cyst, which comprise between 10 and 15 per cent of all primary retroperitoneal tumors and are the most likely to calcify.[3](#core-r003) One often sees teeth or bone in such lesions, but sometimes only nonspecific calcific deposits are demonstrable. Two thirds of them occur in women, and a third arise in the second and third decades of life. They are asymptomatic and frequently displace the ureter and the bowel. A fibroid may also calcify, of course, as can chronic inflammatory processes primary in either the kidney or the spine, for which there is no evidence in this case. Tuberculous lymphadenitis or spondylitis, for example, can give rise to calcified retroperitoneal tumors. The neuroblastoma is another retroperitoneal tumor that characteristically calcifies, but it almost invariably occurs in children. Another lesion that might be responsible for a mass in this location and might contain faint calcification is a so-called traumatic blood cyst. It's conceivable that there was hemorrhage into the mesentery adjacent to the mesoappendix at the time of the appendectomy, with the development of a hematoma that slowly enlarged over the four-and-a-half-year period as a result of fluid absorption, and such a mass might ultimately become calcified.I must consider other tumors and cysts of the retroperitoneal space more seriously now that doubt has been cast on the presence of calcification. Cysts derived from remnants of the mesonephric duct may arise anywhere from the level of the kidney to the vagina, where the more common Gartnerduct cysts occur. A paraovarian cyst, which is a type of mesonephric cyst, is also a good possibility in this case. A chylous cyst should be mentioned, but I don't know how to arrive at that specific diagnosis in this instance. Does the density suggest fat, Dr. Howry?Dr. Howry: It definitely is not fat.Dr. Green: Enterogenous cysts, or duplications of the bowel, develop between the leaves of the mesentery anywhere along the course of the large or small bowel. However, they usually have some connection with the lumen of the intestinal tract at one end or the other, and I would expect the connection to be demonstrable on the barium-enema examination. The lipoma is a common retroperitoneal tumor and may be huge. The possibility of a fibroma must also be mentioned. Less commonly, a retroperitoneal mass in this age group proves to be a malignant tumor, but that is generally a disorder of childhood, and the evidence in this case points toward a benign process.I shall conclude by saying that this patient had a retroperitoneal tumor. If it had indeed contained calcification, as described in the original interpretation of the x-ray films, I would have chosen the teratoma-dermoid category of tumors as my first diagnosis, with an old traumatic blood cyst or a slightly calcified fibroid, as alternate possibilities. Since the radiologist today sees no evidence of calcification I shall instead favor a benign cystic lesion such as a chylous, mesonephric or m\u00fcllerian-duct cyst.A Physician: Did the patient have a retrocecal appendix?Dr. Scully: It was not so described.A Physician: I wonder about the consistence of the mass. Since it seems to have been in proximity to the ascending colon and was described as cylindrical, could it have been the cecum or the ascending colon rather than the lesion itself that was palpated? I think that it could have been a solid fibroma of retroperitoneal origin instead of a cystic mass. Likewise, the mobility of the mass suggests that it might have been the ascending colon.A Physician: Could an endometrioma produce this picture?Dr. Green: I suppose that it could, although I have never heard of endometrial tissue being encountered in this area. In the series of 120 retroperitoneal tumors that Pack and Tabah[3](#core-r003) reported about ten years ago no endometriomas were described.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Scully: The unusual feature of the first operation was the finding of two thin-walled cysts floating in the abdominal cavity ([Fig. 2](#f002)). Microscopical examination revealed that they were lined by squamous epithelium, which is a frequent finding in peritoneal cysts of mesothelial origin. Dr. Earle W. Wilkins, who performed the first operation, also re-explored this patient. The ovaries and fallopian tubes were unremarkable, and the uterus was of normal size. Several small, thin-walled cysts were again found lying free in the abdominal cavity. Numerous tiny cysts were also seen in the mesentery of the small bowel, and a single cyst, 1 cm. in diameter, was attached to the posterior surface of the uterus. A small, dark nodule that was thought to be a focus of endometriosis was adherent to the cul-de-sac. The major abnormality was a large cystic retroperitoneal mass located just to the right of the ascending colon. The cecum was mobile, but there was no abnormality at the site of the appendectomy. The large cyst was dissected away from the bowel, with which it did not communicate, and several of the smaller cysts were also removed.The paracolonic cyst was ovoid and measured 13 cm. in greatest diameter. On section ([Fig. 3](#f003)) it was found to be composed of multiple communicating locules separated by fibrous tissue with foci of hemorrhage. The compartments contained yellow, watery fluid and gelatinous material. Microscopical examination revealed considerable chronic inflammation, hemorrhage and fibrosis of both recent and remote origin in the wall of the cyst ([Fig. 4](#f004)), and these changes were probably associated with the patient's symptoms. The cyst was lined by squamous epithelium, as were the two cysts that were removed at the first operation and all the other cysts that were resected at this time ([Fig. 5](#f005)). Even the nodule in the cul-de-sac, which was thought to be a focus of endometriosis, proved to be a peritoneal inclusion cyst containing a large amount of recent and old hemorrhage and fibrosis.My first experience with peritoneal inclusion cysts was several years ago, when I saw the microscopical slides from a twenty-two-year-old woman in whom about 25 of them, measuring up to 5 cm. in diameter, were found lying free in the abdominal cavity at the time of a cesarean section. In 1960 a group of investigators in Argentina collected 7 cases of loose peritoneal cysts from the literature and added 5 of their own.[4](#core-r004) In 1 of the latter cases the preoperative diagnosis had been appendicitis, and in another, a leiomyoma of the uterus. There have also been a number of case reports of single or multiple cysts of mesothelial origin attached to various intraperitoneal structures or the abdominal wall[5,6](#core-r005) or deeply embedded, forming large retroperitoneal masses in close proximity to the large intestine.[7,8](#core-r007) In 1 such case the preoperative diagnosis had been carcinoma of the cecum.[7](#core-r007) In many cases of attached cysts there is a history of an operation months or years before,[9](#core-r009) or pelvic inflammatory disease has produced adhesions and given rise to the cysts. A few years ago we saw a woman with extensive endometriosis who had a large mesothelium-lined cyst that was adherent to the uterus, rectum and sigmoid, presumably, as a result of adhesions. Although not unique,[10](#core-r010) the present case differs from most of those previously reported in that retroperitoneal and free cysts were found in association with one another.A Physician: Do you think that the previous operation had anything to do with this retroperitoneal process?Dr. Scully: That is a possibility, although the large cyst was described by the surgeon as being away from the area of the appendectomy.A Physician: What is the source of the squamous epithelium?Dr. Scully: The squamous epithelium is the result of metaplasia of the mesothelium. I have seen such metaplasia in hernial sacs and in the serosa of the small bowel, and it has been discussed in the literature.[11](#core-r011)A Physician: What is the chance of a recurrence in this case?Dr. Scully: I can't answer that, because there are few reported cases with a follow-up examination. However, this woman still has some small retroperitoneal cysts in the mesentery of the small intestine, and it's conceivable that they will enlarge at a later date.Dr. Howry: Was any calcium found?Dr. Scully: No.\n",

      "question": "A 60-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of fever.\nShe was well until two years previously, when pain developed in both legs; a diagnosis of superficial phlebitis was made, and her symptoms improved on rest. Two weeks later she became febrile, with arthralgia and malaise. The left arm and hand and both feet were numb. On admission to another hospital weakness of grasp and a mild foot drop were found on the left side. The urinary sediment contained innumerable red cells and white cells, with red-cell and granular casts. The creatinine rose from 1.1 to 3.1 mg per 100 ml. Occlusion of the right central retinal artery developed, with permanent total loss of vision in the right eye. The foot drop on the left side became complete, and progressive weakness of the right dorsiflexor muscles occurred. The cerebrospinal fluid was normal. A skin biopsy revealed slight perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, without evidence of necrotizing arteritis. A biopsy of the left kidney disclosed focal necrotizing arteritis and widespread acute focal necrotizing glomerulitis, with the formation of several epithelial crescents; red cells were seen in many tubules; no granulomas were observed. Atrial fibrillation developed but reverted to a normal rhythm after the administration of digoxin. Prednisone was given in a dose that ranged as high as 200 mg daily. Her vision did not improve, but the muscle strength increased, and the creatinine fell to 2.5 mg per 100 ml. She was discharged on a regimen of prednisone, 200 mg every other day.\nOne year before entry she returned to the same hospital because of a febrile episode. Prednisone was continued, but an intermittent low-grade fever persisted. Three months before admission an x-ray film of the chest showed that the heart was normal in size, and the aorta slightly elongated; the lungs appeared clear. The dose of prednisone was reduced to 7.5 mg daily. A left retinal detachment was repaired. Two months before entry an x-ray film of the chest disclosed an ill defined, uncalcified parenchymal density, 1 cm in diameter, underlying the posterior aspect of the right fifth rib; linear densities were seen in the same area and in the left-middle-lung field; the heart appeared normal.\nOne month before admission another bout of fever occurred, with rise of the temperature as high as 41.1\u00b0C every third day. Fatigue and weakness developed. X-ray films of the sinuses disclosed mucosal thickening in the right maxillary and anterior ethmoid sinuses; the other paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx and sella turcica appeared normal. One week before entry the patient had a single night sweat. The left eye became inflamed. An ophthalmologist prescribed local treatment with a sulfonamide and prednisolone. Two days before admission an otolaryngologist was unable to transilluminate the right maxillary antrum, although the other sinuses appeared clear. Repeated films of the sinuses (\nFig. 1\n) demonstrated complete opacification of the right antrum. Hard crusts were cleared from the right nasal cavity, and much mucus was removed from the left side; the nasopharynx, throat, larynx and ears appeared normal; a culture yielded a growth of\nStaphylococcus aureus\n. In the evening a shaking chill developed. On the following day another chill occurred, and the temperature rose to 39.4\u00b0C.\nThere was a long history of chronic sinusitis and recurrent headaches. For 25 years the patient had taken replacement doses of thyroid hormone. She complained of a chronic, mild, nonproductive cough and gave a history of allergy to penicillin and tetracycline.\nThe temperature was 39.3\u00b0C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 150/70 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared obese and not acutely ill. The face was plethoric. The left eye was injected, and a cataract and scleral ulceration were observed; the optic fundi were poorly seen. There was slight tenderness over the right maxillary antrum. The nose and throat appeared normal. The thyroid gland was not enlarged. The lungs were clear. The heart was of normal size; a loud S4 was present, with inspiratory splitting of S2; no murmur or S3 was heard. The breasts were normal. The abdomen was obese, with pale striae. The liver and spleen were not felt. There was minimal peripheral edema. The hands were diffusely swollen, especially in the region of the proximal interphalangeal joints. No joint tenderness was found. Neurologic examination disclosed dysesthesias and impaired sensory perception over the left extremities. Muscle strength was normal aside from a mild left-foot drop. The tendon reflexes were diminished in the lower extremities; the plantar responses were flexor.\nThe urine gave a ++ test for protein; the sediment contained innumerable white cells and + + + bacteria per high-power field. The hematocrit was 35 per cent; the white-cell count was 16,600, with 79 per cent neutrophils, 1 per cent band forms, 14 per cent lymphocytes, 5 per cent monocytes and 1 per cent eosinophils. The platelet count was 420,000, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 131 mm per hour. The prothrombin time was normal. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The urea nitrogen was 30 mg, the creatinine 2.6 mg, the glucose 92 mg, the uric acid 4.2 mg, the bilirubin 0.3 mg, the calcium 8.7 mg, the phosphorus 2.5 mg, the free thyroxine 0.5 ng, the total thyroxine 1.5 \u03bcg, and the protein 7.2 g (the albumin 2.8 g, and the globulin 4.4 g) per 100 ml. The glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) was 23 U, the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 181 U, the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 8 U, the amylase 14 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 5.3 Bodansky U. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 115, with a questionable old inferior myocardial infarct. An x-ray film of the chest (\nFig. 2\n) showed several nodular parenchymal densities, up to 2 cm in diameter, in the right upper and middle lobes and left upper lobe; the remaining lung fields appeared clear. In a 24-hour specimen of urine the protein was 0.5 g, and the creatinine 510 mg. A culture of urine and a blood culture yielded\nEscherichia coli;\ntwo other cultures of samples of blood drawn on the day of admission were negative; a culture of sputum gave an abundant growth of\nStaphylococcus aureus\n.\nErythromycin and nitrofurantoin were administered. An ophthalmologist observed conjunctivitis and prescribed topical gentamicin. The temperature ranged as high as 39.7\u00b0C during the first two days and thereafter was normal. On the fourth hospital day the urea nitrogen was 32 mg, and the creatinine 2.1 mg per 100 ml. An intravenous pyelographic examination revealed a delayed nephrogram on the left side, with dilatation of the ureter to the level of the pelvic brim, consistent with distal ureteral obstruction; the right kidney, right ureter and bladder appeared normal. On the eighth hospital day a Caldwell-Luc operation disclosed thickening and pallor of the mucous membrane; purulent secretions were present. Two days later a retrograde pyelographic examination confirmed the presence of obstruction of the left ureter (\nFig. 3\n).\nAn operation was performed on the 14th hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Raymond E. H. Partridge\\*: At the age of 58 years this patient had a multisystem illness, with fever, arthralgia, neuropathy of the mononeuritis multiplex type, glomerulitis with moderate renal failure, a cardiac arrhythmia and a central-retinal-artery occlusion. A diagnosis of necrotizing arteritis or polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) was presumably made on the basis of the renal biopsy, and the patient was treated with corticosteroids, with apparent stabilization of the renal function for the next two years. The symptoms, apart from a bout of fever after one year, seemed to be controlled during this period. When she was 60 years of age the illness entered a second phase, with the development of parenchymal lung nodules, ocular inflammation, recurrent sinus infection and radiographic evidence of left ureteral obstruction at the pelvic brim. There were superimposed infections with *Esch. coli* and *Staph. aureus,* which were treated with antibiotics.The neuropathy and nephropathy had apparently remained unchanged.The term \"mononeuritis multiplex\" was used by Kernohan and Woltman[1](#core-r001) in 1938 for peripheral-nerve involvement in patients with polyarteritis nodosa. The lesions were associated with localized infarction and secondary degeneration, which were found at autopsy to be caused by obliterative inflammatory changes in the arteries that did not extend into the nerve tissue. Isolated mononeuropathies can also occur with PAN, and in a number of cases a symptomatic sensorimotor polyneuropathy is seen. Mononeuritis multiplex may also develop in association with rheumatoid arthritis accompanied by vasculitis, mixed cryoglobulinemia, Wegener's granulomatosis and, rarely, systemic lupus erythematosus.I shall digress to make a few comments about the pathogenesis and diagnosis of vasculitis. In this case there is a paucity of immunologic data, so that arguments as to the nature of the underlying disease will be based on clinical data, which I shall discuss later. There is much evidence that in some cases necrotizing vasculitis is a result of the deposition of circulating immune complexes in vessel walls with fixation of complement, release of chemotactic factors and subsequent infiltration of the vessel wall by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, with enzyme release causing vascular damage. The lesion resembles that seen in an Arthus reaction. Acute vasculitis has been associated with immune complexes involving serum hepatitis B surface antigen[2](#core-r002) and with mixed IgM-IgG cryoglobulinemia. Hypocomplementemia is found in some of these patients, and immunofluorescence studies of the blood vessels have shown deposits of immunoglobulins and complement in their walls. Similar findings have been observed in association with rheumatoid vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus, and immune complexes are suspected of having a major role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We have no information on which to base a diagnosis of immune-complex vasculitis in this case. Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that when patients present with necrotizing vasculitis involving peripheral nerves and the kidneys it is important to test for the presence of antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies, rheumatoid factor and circulating hepatitis B antigen.A major question is whether the subsequent course of this patient's illness, the development of lung nodules, the ocular and sinus inflammation and the obstruction of the ureter were related to a necrotizing vasculitis or the result of an intercurrent illness. May we see the x-ray films now?Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: The films of the sinuses ([Fig. 1](#f001)) disclose complete opacification of the right antrum and slight thickening of the right ethmoid. There is no definite evidence of bone destruction, although the medial wall of the antrum is not well seen, and complete evaluation of this problem would require polytomographic examination.A radiograph of the chest taken three months before entry was considered normal, but in retrospect, looking at the regions where abnormalities subsequently appeared, particularly the right upper lobe, one can appreciate the presence of a linear, streaklike, atelectatic or fibrotic density extending into the periphery of the lobe and terminating in a small nodular density. On a film obtained two months before admission this area is more obviously the site of a local nodule within the parenchyma, with linear streaking again evident extending toward the hilar area. I see no calcification in the region of the nodule or else-where in the lungs. There is also a suggestion of a generalized increase in streaky interstitial linear densities. The film taken on admission ([Fig. 2](#f002)) reveals a considerable increase in the size of the peripheral right-upper-lobe nodule, which is approximately 2 cm in diameter, and scattered throughout the remainder of both lungs are numerous smaller nodules. The right-upper-lobe lesion is sharply demarcated, with no change in the surrounding parenchyma, and the prominent linear atelectatic or fibrotic scar is again evident.The urograms demonstrate a normal right kidney and ureter. On the left side there is delayed excretion with a nephrogram effect and enlargement of the kidney outline. A delayed film shows some opacification of dilated intrarenal collecting structures and faint opacification of a dilated ureter, which is invisible below the level of the pelvic brim. A left retrograde pyelographic examination was performed, with subsequent injection of the ureteral catheter ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The films show that the distal third of the ureter was diffusely narrowed, with a slightly irregular margin, as it crossed the pelvic brim. The ureter at that point is retracted medially; the pelvic portion of the ureter appears normal. No intraluminal abnormality is obvious, and the findings suggest an extraluminal or periureteral process encasing the structure and retracting it medially.Dr. Partridge: Can you see any indication of a mass extrinsic to that ureter?Dr. Ferrucci: No.Dr. Partridge: I shall consider first the diagnosis of the lung nodules. There was no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The nodules appear well circumscribed, without cavitation or cyst formation. One must not assume that because a patient has vasculitis or another connective-tissue disease the development of an abnormality in a previously uninvolved organ is necessarily due to the underlying disorder. In fact, in a patient with lung nodules the connective-tissue disorder should be placed at the bottom of the list of causes, and efforts should be made to establish the histologic nature of the lesions. Many pulmonary masses of this type prove to be neoplastic. If that were true in this patient their multiplicity would suggest metastases. However, tumor cells were not found in the sputum, and apart from the obstruction of the lower end of the ureter there was no evidence of a neoplasm elsewhere. It is possible that the ureteric obstruction was on the basis of a retroperitoneal lymphoma or a carcinoma of the colon that also metastasized to the lungs; vasculitis may occur in association with lymphoma or colonic cancer. However, the vasculitis in this patient appeared two years before the ureteral obstruction was noticed, and the vasculitis of neoplastic disease tends to be of the small-vessel type with skin lesions rather than the necrotizing vasculitis of larger vessels that was apparently present in this case.The patient had been on steroids for two years, at least part of the time at a high dosage, which would be expected to reduce her resistance to infection. The differential diagnosis of infectious lung lesions includes pyogenic as well as granulomatous infections, such as tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis. Patients who have received steroids can certainly have disseminated infections of those types. Tuberculomas are usually solitary, may calcify and are often accompanied by small satellite lesions in their immediate vicinity. There was no cultural evidence of tuberculosis in this patient, and we don't know whether the PPD skin test was positive. Histoplasmomas likewise are usually solitary, and 80 per cent are associated with satellite lesions. Many histoplasmomas calcify, producing a target lesion that is virtually pathognomonic, and associated hilar-lymph-node calcification is common. The parenchymal lesions seldom exceed four or five in number, whereas about eight were demonstrated on the films of the chest in this case. Coccidioidomycosis may produce multiple nodules from 0.5 to 0.3 cm in diameter that cannot be distinguished from other granulomas on radiologic examination. We do not know whether the patient had been in an area where coccidioidomycosis is endemic, such as the San Joaquin Valley and other parts of the Southwest. Patients on steroids are also more susceptible to staphylococcal infection, but the slow development of the lesions and the lack of cavitation in this case fail to support the diagnosis of a staphylococcal abscess. The absence of a systolic murmur is against endocarditis. Although a diagnosis of thrombophlebitis was made at the onset of the illness, it was almost certainly incorrect because myalgia is a common feature of arteritis. Ovarian-vein thrombophlebitis can occur and is sometimes associated with obstruction of the lower end of the ureter, but that condition is largely confined to pregnant women.[3](#core-r003)Were the lesions in the lungs and the other organ systems manifestations of the necrotizing vasculitis? In 1866 Kussmaul and Maier[4](#core-r004) described periarteritis nodosa in a man 27 years of age with fever, cough, renal disease, muscular weakness and abdominal pain. They found segmental focal lesions in the walls of medium-sized muscular arteries, with a predilection for bifurcations. In the typical form of the disease most of the arteries can be affected, but involvement of the pulmonary arteries is rare. The male-female ratio is about 2:1, and although the disease occurs in persons of all ages the peak frequency is in the fifth and sixth decades. The arterial lesions are of different ages. On microscopical examination there is infiltration of the media by neutrophils and eosinophils, with necrosis extending into the adventitia and intima and destruction of the elastic lamina. Thrombosis, tissue infarction and hemorrhage may result. The symptoms of PAN depend on the organ systems that are involved. The renal disease, neuropathy, cardiac involvement and arthralgia in this patient are quite compatible with this diagnosis. Many of the patients have involvement of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver and central nervous system.Since the original description a number of attempts have been made to subclassify vasculitis, and the classification of Zeek[5](#core-r005) is still in general use. She divided arteritis into rheumatic arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, hypersensitivity angiitis, giant-cell arteritis and allergic granulomatous angiitis. Hypersensitivity angiitis typically involves small arteries, venules and capillaries. All the lesions are at approximately the same stage of evolution, and the skin, lungs and kidneys are most often involved. A drug reaction is a frequent cause, but there is no evidence to support it in this case. Allergic granulomatous vasculitis was described by Churg and Strauss[6](#core-r006) in 1951. In most of their cases there was a long history of allergy, particularly in the form of asthma; granulomatous vasculitis and extravascular granulomas were found in association with marked eosinophilia of the sputum and blood. With other types of vasculitis eosinophilia is uncommon, and with polyarteritis neutrophilia is the rule. Examination of the granulomas of allergic granulomatosis shows intense eosinophilic infiltration. The patients have a transient segmental pneumonitis rather than the nodules seen in this case. Renal disease is mild or absent for a number of years, but later the disease may spread, with severe renal involvement and renal failure. In an analysis of 109 patients Rose and Spencer[7](#core-r007) also divided polyarteritis into the typical form with progressive renal disease but without lung involvement or eosinophilia and a second category with lung involvement and little renal disease. Their cases with intense eosinophilia are probably similar to those of allergic granulomatous vasculitis described by Churg and Strauss, but a number of the patients had no asthma or history of other allergy. In this case the absence of eosinophilia is against a diagnosis of either pulmonary polyarteritis or an arteritis of the Churg and Strauss type. The Zeek classification is not universally accepted, and in a recent report Sack and his colleagues[8](#core-r008) were unable to detect a good correlation of the pulmonary disease, eosinophilia and granulomatous lesions and could not clearly delineate a subgroup of hypersensitivity angiitis.Besides the syndromes characterized by necrotizing vasculitis, other diseases may be complicated by vasculitis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Rheumatoid arthritis may be associated with lung lesions. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis in the lower lung fields is the most common radiographic finding in those patients, but non-pneumoconiotic rheumatoid nodules occur rarely as well. In a recent large series such nodules were seen in only two of 516 cases of rheumatoid arthritis.[9](#core-r009) Vasculitis is associated with the development of rheumatoid nodules and may be involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid lung lesions in general. Rheumatoid vasculitis may involve small arteries or venules,[10](#core-r010) and severe necrotizing arteritis of medium-sized arteries occurs as a terminal event in some patients with severe destructive arthritis and rheumatoid nodules.[11](#core-r011) This patient had diffusely swollen proximal interphalangeal joints but nothing else to suggest a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Systemic lupus erythematosus may be complicated by polyneuropathy and mononeuritis multiplex but has been seen only rarely with those disorders.[12](#core-r012) The microscopical findings in the kidney described in this case are not typical of disseminated lupus erythematosus, and there is no supportive evidence for that diagnosis in the case record in the form of antinuclear-antibodies or serum complement levels. A diagnosis of mixed cryoglobulinemia might have been considered on the first admission two years previously. Patients with that disorder may have Raynaud's phenomenon, vasculitic skin lesions, glomerulitis, myocarditis and a variety of central and peripheral nervous-system manifestations. Pleural effusions have been recorded, but I am unaware of lung nodules.Lastly, I come to a consideration of Wegener's granulomatosis, a disease characterized by a necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tract and glomerulonephritis.[13](#core-r013) Disseminated vasculitis involving both arteries and veins occurs to varying degrees as the disease progresses. There is a form of the disease that is limited primarily to the upper and lower respiratory tract, but that diagnosis need not concern us in regard to this case. Persons of all ages and both sexes are affected, but the highest frequency is in middle adult life. The initial involvement is usually of the nose and paranasal sinuses. In the nasopharynx there may be mucosal ulceration with necrotizing granulomas and in the later stages destruction of bone and a nasal deformity. Secondary bacterial infection is common in the nose and paranasal sinuses, and the organism encountered most often is *Staph. aureus,* [14](#core-r014) as in this case. Serous otitis media may occur and result in deafness. Bilateral nodular and cavitary infiltrates appear in the lungs, and thin-walled cavities like those seen in coccidioidomycosis may be observed. Occasionally, only a solitary nodule is present. One radiologic phenomenon that is highly suggestive of the disease is progression of a lesion in one lung and regression in the other lung. In the early stages of Wegener's granulomatosis there may be a focal glomerulonephritis, and a fulminant necrotizing glomerulonephritis may be found in advanced cases. The heart may be involved by pericarditis and coronary vasculitis. The involvement of the nervous system presents clinically as a mononeuritis multiplex, and cranial arteritis may also occur. In two reported cases Wegener's granulomatosis presented as a typical rheumatoid arthritis with vasculitis, which lasted for several months before the true nature of the disease became apparent.[15](#core-r015) Skin involvement in patients with this disorder takes the form of small-vessel vasculitis, which was not observed in this patient. Ocular lesions may occur and include conjunctivitis, uveitis, scleromalacia and pseudotumor of the orbit. Anemia, leukocytosis, hypoglobulinemia and marked elevation of the sedimentation rate are also features of this disease. Eosinophilia is rare.This patient had many of the lesions associated with Wegener's granulomatosis. The necrotizing glomerulitis and arteritis were typical, as was the peripheral neuropathy. She had both upper-respiratory-tract and lower-respiratory-tract lesions, and the ocular lesions as described were compatible with that diagnosis. A disturbing feature is the way the disease started. In almost all the reported cases respiratory involvement was present at the onset of the illness. This patient had a long history of recurrent sinusitis. It is possible that when she presented with diffuse vasculitis and mononeuritis multiplex an upper-respiratory-tract lesion was not noted, and x-ray films of the sinuses were not obtained. The prognosis for patients with untreated Wegener's granulomatosis is poor, and the disease has a rapidly fatal course, with a mean survival of five months; 82 per cent of the patients die within one year, and more than 90 per cent die within two years.[16](#core-r016) However, partial responses to corticosteroids have been reported, and this patient certainly received steroids in large doses at the onset of the illness, perhaps accounting for the prolonged survival.One other feature of the case to be discussed is the obstruction of the left ureter and its relation to the underlying disease. Periureteral vasculitis has been described in one case of polyarteritis nodosa associated with periureteral and retroperitoneal fibrosis.[17](#core-r017) It was located over the promontory of the sacrum and caused obstruction of the ureter. I suggest that this is the explanation in the case under discussion, although I am not aware that this complication has been described in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis.There remains the nature of the operation performed on the 14th hospital day. The patient had already undergone a Caldwell-Luc procedure, and I assume that the typical granuloma with giant-cell formation was not found in the excised tissue. If a non-specific inflammatory change was seen it would have been necessary to make the diagnosis by examination of other lesions. Either of two operations might then have been performed. A laparotomy might have been done to relieve the ureteral obstruction. However, a more likely procedure is a biopsy of a nodule in the right lung. The importance of establishing the correct diagnosis cannot be emphasized too strongly. In recent years it has been shown that Wegener's granulomatosis responds dramatically to cytotoxic agents, particularly cyclophosphamide, and the survival time has been greatly prolonged.In summary, therefore, I propose that this patient had Wegener's granulomatosis involving the lungs, kidneys, scleras, peripheral nervous system and retroperitoneal arteries, causing periureteral inflammation and ureteral obstruction.Dr. Robert T. McCluskey: Dr. Schoolnik, will you give the opinion of the medical students on this case?Dr. Gary K. Schoolnik: They thought that the diverse manifestations of the illness suggested a systemic disease, that the systemic disease was secondary to a vasculitis, and that the vasculitis was probably that of Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. McCluskey: Did they believe that Wegener's granulomatosis was the cause of the ureteral obstruction as well?Dr. Schoolnik: They did. They referred to a reported case in which polyarteritis nodosa had involved the periureteral tissue to produce a similar constricting lesion[17](#core-r017) but were unable to find a case of Wegener's granulomatosis that involved the ureter in a similar fashion.Dr. Ferrucci: The interesting finding of a linear atelectatic scar in the right upper lobe on the initial radiographs certainly suggests an inflammatory rather than a neoplastic process, although the single large nodule is a little more discretely marginated than the usual lesion in Wegener's granulomatosis. It is difficult to exclude the possibility of tuberculosis on the basis of the films. Tuberculous ureteritis is also a possibility, although the location of the involvement is not typical.Dr. Partridge: Isn't tuberculous ureteritis usually associated with involvement of the kidney?[18](#core-r018)Dr. Ferrucci: Usually it is.Dr. Partridge: I assume that in this case there was no evidence of renal tuberculosis.Dr. Ferrucci: Yes, but the lack of evidence does not necessarily exclude it.Dr. Reginald E. Greene: I have seen several cases of Wegener's granulomatosis with very sharply defined nodular lesions, and I wouldn't regard the sharp definition of the lesion in this case as a point against the diagnosis.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Robert B. Colvin: In the renal-biopsy specimen obtained two years before admission about 60 per cent of the glomeruli had very striking changes, including segmental necrosis with nuclear debris, neutrophilic infiltration and prominent epithelial crescents. Even in the severely affected glomeruli, however, some segments appeared fairly normal, so that the process is best described as a segmental, focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescents ([Fig. 4](#f004)). In addition, in a few small arteries we observed extensive mural necrosis with fibrinoid deposits and nuclear debris ([Fig. 5](#f005)). No granulomas were found. Immunofluorescence studies, done by Dr. Eleanora Galvanek at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, revealed small amounts of IgG and C3 granular deposits in the glomeruli. The differential diagnosis included hypersensitivity angiitis, periarteritis nodosa and, of course, Wegener's granulomatosis.[14,19](#core-r014) Without granulomas the last diagnosis could not be made, and the diagnosis at that time was periarteritis nodosa.The nature of the disease became clearer two years later when sinus involvement became evident. The Caldwell-Luc procedure obtained tissue from the right maxillary sinus, and the sections showed extensive areas of necrosis and occasional giant cells ([Fig. 6](#f006)). The arteries were so damaged that they were very hard to identify, but on special stains for elastic fibers one could find small remnants that had undergone necrosis. No fungi or acid-fast organisms were identified by special staining. The combination of granulomatosis, necrotizing sinusitis, arteritis and necrotizing glomerulonephritis permits the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.The procedure at this hospital was repair of the ureteral obstruction by Dr. Hensle, and in the course of this operation a second renal biopsy was done. In this specimen about a third of the glomeruli were totally obsolescent, 10 per cent were severely damaged in a segmental fashion with crescents, neutrophils and fibrin in the tufts, and the remainder appeared normal. In addition, we found one granuloma, characterized by giant cells surrounding an eosinophilic area, that appeared to be the remnant of a glomerulus ([Fig. 7](#f007)). No arteritis was present in the sample.Immunofluorescence study of the glomeruli disclosed fibrin, as expected, in the epithelial crescents. However, only trace amounts of granular deposits of IgM, IgG and C3 were detected in the tufts. On electronmicroscopical examination the glomerular basement membranes appeared normal in the two glomeruli sampled, with no electron-dense deposits along them or in the mesangium. So we have no morphologic evidence of an immune-complex cause of the patient's illness. The serum was studied for the presence of immune complexes by Dr. C. Alan Brown and Dr. Clive L. Hall, and none were seen. We have detected complexes at low levels by this assay in only one of five patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. The pathogenesis of the arteritis and glomerulonephritis is not clear, and there is no convincing evidence that immune complexes have a role. Dr. Hensle will describe the operative findings.Dr. Terry W. Hensle: Since the nature of the lesion at the distal end of the left ureter was not clear from the preoperative intravenous urograms the patient was taken to the operating room, where a left retrograde pyelographic study was done. The films showed extraluminal obstruction of the ureter from the pelvic brim to the bladder, which we believed was most consistent with retroperitoneal fibrosis, possibly associated with Wegener's granulomatosis. At operation we found that the distal portion of the left ureter was encased in dense fibrous tissue, with obliteration of the lumen. In contrast to retroperitoneal fibrosis, the process in this case seemed to be localized to the retroperitoneum in the area extending from the left iliac crest to the bladder. Rather than attempt a difficult and perhaps impossible lysis of the distal ureter we decided to divide the ureter above the pelvic brim and bring it across the retroperitoneum and perform a left-to-right transureteroureterostomy. This procedure was not difficult technically since the right ureter was normal, and postoperatively the patient did very well, with return of the intravenous urograms to nearly normal.Dr. Colvin: The examination of the segment of obstructed left ureter showed marked inflammation and fibrosis in the periureteral tissue and also within the wall (Fig. [8](#f008) and [9](#f009)). Edema, dilatation of the lymphatics and focal mucosal ulceration were evident. Many arteries and some small veins were involved by a severe necrotizing vasculitis similar to that observed in the first renal-biopsy specimen. The infiltrating cells were mononuclear, with a few plasma cells and occasional eosinophils and neutrophils. In the nonobstructed right ureter there were changes very similar to those on the obstructed side. The wall was edematous, and the arteries were the site of the same severe necrotizing process that was found on the left side. The mechanism of the ureteral obstruction is not clear. It probably was a combination of edema and spasm related to ischemia. We were also unable to find any information in the literature on ureteral obstruction resulting from Wegener's granulomatosis. Ureteral obstruction seems to be a very unusual complication of any sort of arteritis. This case is different from those reported by Samellas et al.,[17](#core-r017) referred to by Dr. Partridge and Dr. Schoolnik, in that the vasculitis affected the ureteral as well as the periureteral vessels.As noted by Dr. Partridge, a second unusual feature of this case is that the patient presented with renal and neurologic signs before there was evidence of upper-airway or pulmonary disease. She initially seemed to have periarteritis nodosa, both clinically and pathologically. The diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis is most convincing when the classic triad is present \u2014 namely, upper-airway or lung granulomas, necrotizing glomerulonephritis and arteritis. Conceivably, the disease might involve only one of these sites, and indeed many authorities think that there is a limited form with only pulmonary involvement.[20](#core-r020) In the kidney it is not possible to make the specific diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis with current technics. Thus, a renal forme fruste would be unrecognizable. However, the pathologist should consider this diagnosis when a biopsy specimen shows necrotizing glomerulonephritis or arteritis since this disease can often be cured by proper therapy.Dr. Jacob Lerman: This patient was treated with thyroid, presumably for hypothyroidism. I had one patient treated with thyroid for chronic thyroiditis for many years. Wegener's granulomatosis developed subsequently, and she was treated with prednisone, with a good result. Since hypothyroidism is frequently due to chronic thyroiditis, I wonder what relation there is between Wegener's granulomatosis and chronic thyroiditis.Dr. Partridge: I don't know of any association and could not find any reported in the literature.\n",

      "question": "First admission.\nA fifty-eight-year-old woman entered the hospital because of headache and vomiting.\nSix days before admission the patient had a bitemporal and occipital headache, which came on at the end of a busy day. On the following morning the headache was worse, and during the day she developed some blurring of vision and diplopia. Three days before admission while walking she stumbled and fell. She became severely nauseated and vomited several times. On the day before admission she became drowsy, sluggish in conversation and responses, and somewhat confused. The headache, meanwhile, persisted with varying intensity, and vomiting occurred intermittently up to the time of admission.\nIn the past the patient's general health had been excellent. At about the age of twenty-six, she had a thyroidectomy, following which from time to time she had feelings of fatigue and lassitude that responded well to small doses of thyroid.\nOn physical examination the patient was somewhat obese. She had always been left handed. Although conscious and cooperative she was drowsy, dull and inaccurate about dates. The visual acuity and fields were normal. The patient complained of diplopia on attempting to read, but none could be demonstrated with red-glass testing. The optic fundi were normal. The right eye was slightly prominent as compared with the left. There was a very slight degree of right lower facial weakness. Tests of strength and co-ordination of the limbs were normally performed. The tendon jerks were present and slightly more active in the right arm and leg. The right plantar reflex was extensor in type, and the left uncertain. Sensation, including sensory discrimination, was normal. The heart, lungs and abdomen were normal.\nThe temperature was 98.6\u00b0F., the pulse 84, and the respirations 16. The blood pressure was 116 systolic, 65 diastolic.\nUrinalysis was normal. The white-cell count was 8400, with a normal differential, and the hemoglobin was 13.6 gm. The nonprotein nitrogen was 21 mg., the fasting blood sugar 116 mg., and the cholesterol 250 mg. per 100 cc. No bromides were found in the serum. The basal metabolic rate was -18 per cent. An x-ray film of the chest was normal except for bilateral cervical ribs. X-ray films of the skull showed irregular thickening of the inner table of the frontal bone bilaterally, and there were some small lacunae in the temporal and occipital regions, interpreted as \"venous lakes,\" but the bones of the vertex were otherwise normal and the sella turcica and clinoid processes were intact. The pineal body was not visualized. Lumbar puncture showed a spinal-fluid pressure equivalent to 150 to 160 mm. of water; the fluid was clear and colorless and contained 1 lymphocyte per cubic millimeter and a protein of 41 mg. per 100 cc. The Wassermann test was negative.\nIn the hospital the patient rapidly became asymptomatic and was discharged on the seventh hospital day.\nSecond admission\n(two years later). Following discharge, the patient was active and well. About three weeks before readmission she had a recurrence of frontal and occipital headaches, and became \"dopey\" and mentally slow, but she was better after two days. Three days before entry the frontal headache returned and became constant, and on the next day there was constant nausea and repeated vomiting. She again became drowsy and mentally dull.\nOn readmission, she was drowsy and very slow in her responses but could answer simple questions correctly. On neurologic examination the eye findings were unchanged. There was a slight ptosis of the right upper eyelid, but the pupils were equal and of normal size, and reacted briskly to light and on attempted convergence. Convergence was poor, but the other ocular movements were normal. Again, there was a slight right facial weakness. With the arms outstretched the right drifted downward; otherwise, there was no definite weakness in the limbs. The arm jerks were brisker on the right, the abdominal reflexes brisker on the left, and the knee and ankle jerks equal and normally active. The plantar reflexes were variable on both sides. Sensation was normal throughout, including sense of passive movement and stereognosis. The general physical examination was unchanged.\nThe temperature, pulse and respirations were normal. The blood pressure was 160 systolic, 70 diastolic.\nUrinalysis was normal. The white-cell count was 12,600, and the hemoglobin 13.0 gm. X-ray studies were unchanged except for calcification of the internal carotid arteries. An electroencephalogram (\nFig. 1\n) showed slow-wave activity in the left frontal and parietal regions extending across the midline to the right in the central region. In the left frontal region there were spike-like, fast-slow complexes. The remainder of the record was not remarkable. Lumbar puncture showed a spinal-fluid pressure equivalent to 150 mm. of water and clear fluid containing 10 red cells per cubic millimeter and a total protein of 60 mg. per 100 cc.\nIn the hospital the patient became mentally clear. The slight weakness in the right arm disappeared, and the right plantar reflex became extensor and the left, flexor; the other neurologic findings remained unchanged. The patient was discharged on the tenth hospital day.\nThird admission\n(two months later). At home the patient had occipital headaches intermittently, usually at night or in the early morning. The gait became unsteady, with deviation to the right. Urinary urgency reached the point of incontinence at times. Otherwise, she had been well and had done much reading apparently without visual impairment or difficulty in comprehension. She was readmitted for re-evaluation of the condition.\nOn physical examination responses were slow, but the patient was mentally clear. The right hand was slightly clumsy in fine movements, but there were no other motor abnormalities. The tendon reflexes were brisker on the right, and the abdominal reflexes absent on the right; the right plantar reflex was extensor, and the left normal. The findings were otherwise the same. Blood, urine and electroencephalographic findings were unchanged. The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day.\nFourth admission\n(one month later). There was no change in the patient's state until the night before admission, when she suddenly became incontinent of urine and vomited two or three times. She rapidly became drowsy and then unconscious. No known convulsions occurred.\nThe patient was comatose. The pupils were 3 mm. in diameter bilaterally and reacted to light. The orbiculares oculorum were flaccid bilaterally, and there was no facial asymmetry. The neck was supple. There were occasional spontaneous semipurposive movements of the left limbs, but the right limbs moved only on painful stimulation. There was a slight increase of resistance to passive movement in the right arm and leg. The tendon reflexes were equal and moderately active, the abdominal reflexes absent and the plantar reflexes bilaterally extensor.\nThe temperature was 98.6\u00b0F., the pulse 85, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 155 systolic, 85 diastolic.\nX-ray films of the skull showed decalcification of the posterior clinoid processes. A left internal carotid arteriogram showed incomplete filling of the left anterior cerebral artery and some downward displacement of the left middle cerebral artery.\nOn the fifth hospital day an operation was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Madelaine R. Brown\\*: May we see the electroencephalogram now?\\*Associate neurologist, Massachusetts General Hospital.Dr. Robert S. Schwab: As one can see clearly in the tracing ([Fig. 1](#f001)), the slow activity in Line 1 is quite marked compared to Line 4, which represents the homologous area in the right frontal region. In the posterior frontal lead, Line 6, there is the same slow activity with some sharp waves and even a suggestion of spikes, which are not seen at all in the lead from the homologous area, Line 8. The electroencephalogram indicates a focus in the left frontal and left posterior frontal regions extending to the midline. The electroencephalogram two months later is essentially the same.Dr. Brown: Now I think we might look at the two sets of x-ray films, one on the first admission and one on the last admission.Dr. Stanley M. Wyman: The chest films are not remarkable except for some slight prominence of the left ventricle and slight tortuosity and calcification of the aortic arch. The first examination of the skull as described showed minimal internal hyperostosis of the frontal bone, which can be well seen in the posteroanterior projection. I think there was probably some calcification present in the internal carotid artery at that time. The next examination two years later shows the posterior clinoid processes to be quite osteoporotic, suggesting increased intracranial pressure. There is no evidence of localizing value in the skull however. The last examination, an arteriogram, was done approximately four months after the second and shows rather striking downward displacement of the middle-cerebral-artery group. The anterior cerebral artery is not filled, nor are its pericallosal and callosomarginal branches. The anteroposterior film, unfortunately, is technically marred, but it confirms the absence of filling of the anterior cerebral artery.Dr. Brown: Were those venous lakes in the bone important?Dr. Wyman: I do not see any change between the first and the second examination to suggest metastatic cancer. I think they are quite consistent with venous lakes.Dr. Brown: Is that a normal finding? Dr. Wyman: It is a variation of the normal, I think.Dr. Brown: As often happens, it is very difficult to distinguish between thrombosis or hemorrhage involving a cerebral artery on the one hand and a brain tumor on the other. During the first admission the patient had focal signs on the right, showing that there was some sort of lesion on the left side of the brain but no evidence of increased intracranial pressure. The general symptoms of vomiting and headache may be seen with tumor or vascular disease because they are due to interference either with the blood or spinal-fluid circulation. Since she had no evidence of interference with spinal-fluid circulation, the general symptoms of headache, vomiting and mental confusion probably came from interference with the circulation of the blood and I imagine she was discharged the first time with a diagnosis of hemorrhage or thrombosis.When the patient entered the hospital for the second time, the spinal fluid contained a total protein of 60 mg., and the electroencephalogram showed abnormal waves from the left frontal lobe. There was no change between that electroencephalogram and the second one two months later. Dr. Schwab tells me that usually the signs clear up after a certain period if they are due to vascular disease.On the third admission the patient, in addition to the right lower facial weakness and reflex changes on the right, had urinary incontinence and some unsteadiness\u2014both frontal-lobe signs. On the fourth admission she was in coma and had not only a right hemiplegia but also some left-sided signs, and the posterior clinoid processes in the x-ray film showed evidence of increased pressure. I am discarding that hyperostosis frontalis \u2014 it seems to be minimal and often occurs in women at the time of the menopause, supposedly on an endocrine basis.I think the patient had a brain tumor of the left frontal lobe because of the right hemiplegia, the finding in the electroencephalogram and the arteriogram. The most common tumor in this region is either a meningioma or a glioma. The evidence for meningioma is the slowness of growth of the tumor, \u2014 there was a two-year interim, \u2014 the ptosis of the right eyelid and the proptosis of the right eye. There are three types of meningiomas in the frontal region: those arising from the dura over the sphenoid ridge, those from over the olfactory groove and those from the falx between the hemispheres (parasagittal). Since the facial weakness was present *at* the time of the first admission and optic atrophy, anosmia and visual-field defects were absent, it seems probable that the patient had a parasagittal meningioma invading the left frontal lobe. The second choice is glioma of the left frontal lobe.Dr. Tracy B. Mallory: Have you anything to add, Dr. Schwab?Dr. Schwab: I might amplify the statement that Dr. Brown has already made about the value of serial electroencephalograms. In the differential diagnosis between cerebrovascular disease (thrombosis) and tumor, we have found that the ordinary thrombosis clears up in a week or two and is nearly gone as far as an electroencephalographic focus is concerned in a month, whereas a tumor has a specific persistent focus. Statistically there is an 8:1 chance that a persistent focus is due to an expanding lesion in that area, such as tumor, subdural hematoma, aneurysm or abscess.Dr. Alfred Kranes: Would the fact that that electroencephalographic focus disappeared alter that at all? In other words is it likely that changes due to tumor will disappear? We have seen that in some patients in whom I have been interested.Dr. Schwab: It does not happen very often. The focus was more noticeable on one tracing and less noticeable on a second, but most of the tumors, 80 per cent of those we have seen, have a persistent focus, which gradually gets worse as the tumor grows. In 8, 10, 15 or 20 per cent of cases, depending upon the location of the tumor, this is not true.A Physician: What percentage of meningiomas develop calcium visible on x-ray examination?Dr. Wyman: Unfortunately, not a very high percentage. Many have bone changes, but actual calcium in a meningioma is not common.Dr. Charles S. Kubik: I do not wish to minimize the value of the electroencephalogram, but it is important to remember that the clinical features of this case pointed toward tumor rather than a vascular lesion. With any vascular lesion the onset is usually sudden. Cerebral hemorrhage is almost invariably fatal and scarcely has to be considered if recovery takes place. Infarction does not often give rise to attacks of drowsiness and stupor when there is so little paralysis. Another remarkable feature was that the symptoms were the same in successive attacks. It would be most unusual for a vascular lesion always to occur in the same place and to produce practically identical symptoms in three or four attacks.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Mallory: A cerebral exploration was performed on the left, and a tumor was found in the parasagittal region that extended partly across the midline. Dr. Kubik can give us further details.Dr. Kubik: The tumor, which was a large meningioma, was unusually pale, necrotic and not very vascular. A large part of it was removed quite easily by suction. The patient remained in coma following the operation and was quite unresponsive for three or four weeks. Recently, she had begun to move her arm, to take some notice of things and to make an attempt to talk.Dr. Brown: Do you know why the neurosurgeons waited so long before going ahead with the diagnostic procedure?Dr. Kubik: When she improved, the patient and her family were opposed to an operation, so that things were allowed to drift until the last crisis. It was thought, as a matter of fact, on the first admission that tumor was a likely diagnosis.Dr. Allen G. Brailey: What do you think was the mechanism of the sudden appearance of symptoms that cleared up and then reappeared and so on?Dr. Kubik: We have often wondered about that. This case is not unique in that respect. We have observed the same thing in other cases of brain tumor. When intracranial pressure is increased, it may not require very much to create a serious disorder of the circulation. In this case the patient, who had been staying quietly at home, was taken out in a motor car, made a number of calls and was unusually active on the day she became stuporous.\n",

      "question": "A 50-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of fever and abdominal pain.\nDiabetes mellitus was found 15 years before admission and was regulated with diet and isophane insulin. Two years before entry a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism was established, and treatment with levothyroxine was instituted. Thirteen months before admission she entered another hospital because of diarrhea and fever. A stool culture yielded salmonella organisms. Pain developed in the right upper abdominal quadrant, and a cholecystectomy was performed. The gallbladder was hydropic and contained stones 3 to 6 mm in diameter; the cystic duct was small. An intraoperative cholangiographic study was not performed. The patient was told that she had salmonella infection of the gallbladder. A brief course of antibiotics was given by vein, followed by the oral administration of ampicillin. During the postoperative period a small amount of pus drained from the lateral extremity of the subcostal incision, and the drainage persisted. Three cultures of the material yielded coagulase-positive staphylococci, and two cultures yielded an enterobacter species that was not salmonella.\nTwo weeks before entry the patient had a brief episode of nausea and vomiting, and the volume of drainage increased. On the day before admission nausea and epigastric pain developed. On the following day the nausea increased, the drainage from the incision became more turbid, fever developed, and the urine was dark.\nThere was no history of chills, and the patient denied previous jaundice, recent dental care, blood transfusions, or contact with patients with hepatitis.\nThe temperature was 39.6\u00b0C, the pulse 130, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\nOn examination she was jaundiced and appeared acutely ill. No sign of sepsis was found. A few rales were heard at both lung bases. The heart was normal. The abdomen was scaphoid, with normal bowel sounds. Moderate tenderness and fullness were noted about a scar in the right upper abdominal quadrant; a sinus at the lateral margin of the scar yielded purulent fluid. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\nThe urine gave a + + test for protein, a + + test for glucose, and a ++ test for bile; the sediment contained 8 red cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 38.6 per cent, and the white-cell count 9800. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The urea nitrogen was 9 mg per 100 ml (3.2 mmol per liter), the glucose 245 mg per 100 ml (13.6 mmol per liter), the conjugated bilirubin 4 mg per 100 ml (68.4 \u03bcmol per liter), the total bilirubin 4.6 mg per 100 ml (83.8 \u03bcmol per liter), and the protein 7.9 g per 100 ml. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) was 865 U per milliliter (7 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), the alkaline phosphatase 348 IU (5.8 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n) per liter, the amylase 5 U per milliliter, and the 5' nucleotidase 11.9 Bodansky U (1067.1 nmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter). Microscopical examination of a stained smear of drainage from the sinus tract revealed neutrophils but no microorganisms. X-ray films of the chest and abdomen were normal.\nSpecimens of blood, urine, and drainage from the sinus tract were obtained for culture, and the patient was given penicillin, chloramphenicol, insulin, and intravenously administered fluids. On the second hospital day her appetite returned. The temperature rose to 39.1\u00b0C; the white-cell count was 7600. The conjugated bilirubin was 4.4 mg per 100 ml (75.2 \u03bcmol per liter), and the total bilirubin 5.4 mg per 100 ml (92.3 \u03bcmol per liter). The SGOT was 250 U per milliliter (2 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), and the alkaline phosphatase 266 IU (4.4 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n) per liter. An ultrasound study of the liver showed an irregular sonolucent structure, 3 by 4 cm, just beneath the skin; it contained ill-defined echogenic foci and had an appearance consistent with a fluid collection or abscess; the common hepatic duct was of normal size, and the liver appeared slightly enlarged. On the following day the temperature did not exceed 37.8\u00b0C. Drainage persisted from the sinus tract. The conjugated bilirubin was 2.3 mg per 100 ml (39.3 \u03bcmol per liter), and the total bilirubin 2.9 mg per 100 ml (49.6 \u03bcmol per liter). The SGOT was 150 U per milliliter (1.2 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n) per liter, and the alkaline phosphatase 221 IU (3.7 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n) per liter. A wound culture, obtained on admission, yielded a few gram-negative rods; a culture of urine and several blood cultures were negative. On the fourth hospital day the patient felt well. The temperature was normal and remained so thereafter. The conjugated bilirubin was 1.6 mg per 100 ml (27.4 \u03bcmol per liter), and the total bilirubin 2.1 mg per 100 ml (35.9 \u03bcmol per liter).\nOn the sixth hospital day gram-negative rods in a culture obtained from the sinus-tract drainage were identified as salmonella, Group D. The conjugated bilirubin was 1.3 mg per 100 ml (22.2 \u03bcmol per liter), and the total bilirubin 1.9 mg per 100 ml (32.5 \u03bcmol per liter). A transhepatic cholangiographic examination revealed suboptimal opacification of the intrahepatic biliary ducts because of their small caliber; the common bile duct was seen except for the segment just above the ampulla; no dilatation or extravasation of contrast material was observed, and no calculi were evident. On the seventh hospital day a sinogram (\nFig. 1\n) disclosed a horizontal subhepatic sinus tract, 3 cm in length, that led to a rounded, circumscribed collection to the right of the third lumbar vertebra; the latter lesion had a diameter of 1.5 cm and contained a filling defect 0.8 cm in diameter; no connection was observed between the sinus tract and the biliary tree or any other structure.\nAn operation was performed on the eighth hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. George L. Nardi\\*: For a surgeon this case seems relatively straightforward in terms of therapy. The patient had jaundice and fever subsequent to a cholecystectomy. Subcostal drainage appeared post-operatively and persisted, and she became acutely ill and febrile. On admission to this hospital an operation was obviously required, and the purpose of this exercise is to define why. Before continuing I shall ask Dr. Ferrucci to show the radiologic findings.Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: The ultrasonograms demonstrate two relevant findings. The first is that the common hepatic duct, seen in an oblique parasagittal projection through the porta hepatis, appears of normal caliber. In addition, a scan of the subhepatic region reveals a small cystic area about 4 cm below the skin that contains low-level echoes. One of the scans shows a more discrete echogenic focus within this area, which probably indicates, at least in part, the presence of semisolid material.A transhepatic cholangiographic study was done next. Even though the ultrasound study did not showobvious dilatation of the biliary tree, this procedure was considered a reasonable way to opacify the biliary tree, and the films show that the ducts were not dilated. They did not appear to fill well during fluoroscopic examination, and it was only when we reviewed all the films at the conclusion of the procedure that we realized that a small ductal system of normal caliber had been opacified and the distal 1 or 2 cm of the common bile duct had not been demonstrated. So although we could not exclude a calculus in the distal portion of the common bile duct we did not see any evidence of dilatation of the extrahepatic duct system.Finally, a sinogram was performed by insertion of a small catheter into the cutaneous opening and injection of water-soluble contrast material ([Fig. 1](#f001)). A space, 3 cm in diameter, was opacified to the right of the spine. A small, irregular filling defect is visible within it, but there is no evidence of communication with the extrahepatic biliary system.In summary, we found evidence of a small cavity in the anterior subhepatic space that did not appear to communicate with extrahepatic biliary ducts.Dr. Nardi: Examination of the gallbladder a year before admission disclosed calculi. Neither an operative cholangiographic examination nor a common-duct exploration was performed. The most common reason for the return of a patient with fever and jaundice a year or so after a cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis is retention of a stone in the common bile duct with the development of cholangitis. That explanation is not valid in this case since no stone was demonstrated in the biliary system, there was no fistula, and the drainage from the sinus tract was never described as bilious. The biliary tract was apparently normal, and the cause of the problem was evidently extrinsic to it.The radiologic and bacteriologic studies leave little doubt that this patient had an infected subhepatic collection that contained salmonella as well as other bacteria. One problem is how to account for the biochemical evidence of obstructive jaundice. A syndrome that might explain it is intraabdominal sepsis associated with jaundice.[1,2](#core-r001) Its biochemical picture is one of obstructive jaundice, and it is accompanied by a high fever and an absence of leukocytosis, as in this case. The cause of the jaundice in these patients with intraabdominal sepsis is unclear but is thought to be cholestasis due to liver damage by bacterial toxins.What are the possible roles of the salmonella infection and the abnormality reflected in the filling defect in the subhepatic collection demonstrated by the radiologic studies? Could the defect have been produced by a gallstone left behind during the original operation? Do we have any more information about the findings at that time?Dr. Austin L. Vickery, Jr.: We have since obtained a more detailed account of that operation. The gallbladder appeared tense and bluish white and was probably inflamed. The surgeon inserted a trocar into the fundus and drained some whitish bile, which appeared purulent. He removed the gallbladder without exploration of the biliary tree. He concluded that a cholangiographic study would be hazardous in the presence of infection and did not undertake it.Dr. Nardi: His approach was logical. It is possible that the manipulation of a tensely distended gallbladder with a trocar caused a stone to slip out without being recognized. That occurrence would explain the chronic draining sinus. The most common causes of a sinus of this type are a foreign body and granulomatous infection, and in this case it was probably the former. The previous culture suggests that the gallbladder was infected with salmonella, and a gallstone surrounded by organisms and situated under the liver might have caused the persistent drainage. I'm sure that the infection became mixed if it hadn't been initially. At some time in the course the drainage became inadequate, resulting in a flare-up with the development of jaundice. The jaundice was pseudo-obstructive \u2014 i.e., on a metabolic basis.In conclusion, my diagnosis is a subhepatic abscess with pseudo-obstructive jaundice secondary to a residual gallstone infected with salmonella. I don't think that anyone knows who \"Typhoid Mary\" was any more. About a generation ago the most common type of salmonella grown on culture was *Salmonella typhi*, but that is now a rarity, and the most frequently encountered form is *S. enteritidis*.Dr. Cyrus C. Hopkins: Was salmonella grown on culture of the specimen from the initial operation?Dr. Vickery: The only reference in the record is to a culture of the stool. The pathological diagnosis was acute and chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis.Dr. Nardi, could the long-standing severe diabetes have had a role in this woman's illness?Dr. Nardi: Patients with diabetes are more susceptible to infection, which in turn makes diabetic management difficult. This woman's diabetes probably increased the likelihood of a septic course.Dr. Vickery: Mundth, [3](#core-r003) formerly of this hospital, analyzed a series of cases of gallbladder disease, comparing the patients with diabetes with those who were nondiabetic, and found a frequency of gallstones of about 25 per cent in the former in contrast to only about 8 per cent in the latter. On the basis of this study he recommended elective cholecystectomy for diabetic patients with gallstones because of the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with operations for acute complications.Mr. Merz will present the medical students' diagnosis.Mr. Robert Merz: We thought that the findings were most consistent with a subhepatic salmonella abscess, possibly containing a gallstone, and that the acute obstructive jaundice could be explained either by compression of the biliary system from the abscess or by passage of a stone through the common bile duct. Both the hematuria and the salmonella abscess raised the possibility of an underlying malignant tumor.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Vickery: Dr. Margolies, will you tell us your preoperative impression and your operative findings?Dr. Michael N. Margolies: The preoperative considerations were precisely those outlined by Dr. Nardi. The question was how to explain the two apparently disparate findings of obstructive jaundice and a persistently draining sinus. The evidence of a foreign body shown on the sinogram was recognized in retrospect, but with the findings from the other studies we thought that an exploration was required. The patient did prove to have retained gallstones in a subhepatic abscess. We found one large stone and also a smaller one, 2 mm in diameter. The abscess was nowhere near the common bile duct, and we must conclude that the jaundice was not obstructive. Salmonella was obtained in cultures from the abscess. The sinus tract healed after the removal of the foreign body, and the patient is now well five months postoperatively.Dr. Hopkins: The fact that a number of the samples taken for culture during the first postoperative year were obtained in an ambulatory setting and yielded only a few enteric gram-negative rods and *Staphylococcus epidermidis* and not salmonella under-scores our frequent concern that cultures from the opening of a sinus tract often reflect only colonizing organisms and not those that are growing inside. We, too, were never able to understand the picture of obstructive jaundice in this case. Because of the prompt defervescence and return of the biochemical values to normal we doubted that the findings were on a metabolic basis alone or a reflection of sepsis.Dr. Nardi: Rubin and Weinstein[4](#core-r004) stated that salmonella is often difficult to grow on culture except during a flare-up of the infection. When this woman was acutely ill the organism was grown on culture, but at other times it was not. If she had an infected stone and possibly infected bile is she now a carrier?Dr. Hopkins: Whether the bile was infected with salmonella at the time of the first operation is uncertain. She could have had a flare-up of gastrointestinal disease with transient bacteremia, and a stone may have been seeded with organisms at that time. She probably was not treated adequately after the first operation, whether or not the bile was infected. She has now had a more complete course of antibiotics in the hospital and has continued them after discharge. Only subsequent stool cultures will determine whether she is a chronic carrier. If she proves to be a chronic carrier and becomes a food handler in a restaurant she will be a public-health problem.Dr. Nardi: A study of a series of patients who had salmonella in the gallbladder at the time of operation revealed persistence of this infection in the bile after cholecystectomy.[5](#core-r005)Dr. Margolies: About eight years ago I saw a patient with similar results of liver-function tests who was found to have a staghorn calculus and a perinephric abscess abutting the liver and compressing it.Dr. Ferrucci: Dr. Nardi, if it is thought that a stone had been misplaced during a cholecystectomy, is a vigorous attempt made to recover it?Dr. Nardi: Yes, but I suspect that stones are still left behind occasionally without causing any symptoms.\n",

Myocardial infarction occurred 15 years before admission and was followed by infrequent angina pectoris, which responded to nitroglycerin. He also took irregular doses of propranolol because of palpitation. Six years before entry he was first seen at this hospital because of a chronic ulcer of the right leg. The urine was normal. The hematocrit was 41 per cent; the white-cell count was 9500, with normal differential count. The urea nitrogen was 22 mg per 100 ml (7.9 mmol per liter), and the creatinine 1.5 mg per 100 ml (130 \u03bcmol per liter). A percutaneous angiographic examination showed moderate atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta; the right hepatic artery arose from the superior mesenteric artery; bilateral single renal arteries were noted, and the internal mesenteric artery was patent; there was marked atherosclerosis of arteries in the lower extremities, with occlusion of the distal third of the right anterior tibial artery. The patient refused an operation and was discharged. The ulcer gradually healed.\nHe was then in good health until three weeks before admission, when he noticed pruritic red spots on his legs, which became more numerous and spread to his thighs. One week before entry a skin biopsy revealed \"neutrophil-mediated necrotizing venulitis.\" All medication was discontinued, but the patient did not improve. He was referred to another physician, who found proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and red-cell casts. He was admitted to the hospital.\nThere was a history of chronic sinusitis with a persistent drip from the left nostril. The patient was believed to be allergic to procaine. He had smoked cigarettes for many years but had discontinued smoking 16 years before entry. There was no history of fever, chills, gross hematuria, congestive heart failure, or abdominal pain.\nThe temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the pulse 100, and the respirations 16. The blood pressure was 245/75 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared well. Purpuric spots and palpable petechiae covered both lower extremities and were more prominent over the right ankle, where +++ edema was noted. No lymphadenopathy was found. The lungs were clear, and the heart was normal except for a Grade 2 systolic ejection murmur heard along the lower left sternal border. The liver and spleen were not felt. Neurologic examination was negative.\nThe urine gave a ++++ test for protein; the sediment contained 4 white cells, 30 red cells, and occasional red-cell casts per high-power field. The hematocrit was 42 per cent; the white-cell count was 8100, with 69 per cent neutrophils, 22 per cent lymphocytes, 6 per cent monocytes, 2 per cent eosinophils, and 1 per cent basophils. The total eosinophil count was 82 per cubic millimeter. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 60 mm per hour. The platelet count was 287,000. The prothrombin time and the partial thromboplastin time were normal. The urea nitrogen was 45 mg per 100 ml (16.1 mmol per liter), the creatinine 2.4 mg per 100 ml (210 \u03bcmol per liter), the glucose 87 mg per 100 ml (4.8 mmol per liter), the calcium 9.6 mg per 100 ml (2.4 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 3.9 mg per 100 ml (1.3 mmol per liter), the bilirubin 0.5 mg per 100 ml (9 \u03bcmol per liter), the uric acid 9 mg per 100 ml (0.5 mmol per liter), and the protein 7.4 g (the albumin 3.6 g and the globulin 3.8 g) per 100 ml. The sodium was 142 mmol, the potassium 4.8 mmol, the chloride 109 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 24 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) was 15 U per milliliter (0.12 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 113 U per milliliter (1.88 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), the creatine kinase (CK) 36 mU per milliliter (0.60 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), the amylase 17 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 27 IU (0.45 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n) per liter. In a 24-hour specimen of urine the creatinine was 1205 mg (10.65 mmol \u00b7 kg\n-1\n), and the protein 6.3 g. An electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal rhythm at a rate of 91, with evidence of anteroseptal and possible inferior myocardial infarction and possible left ventricular hypertrophy. X-ray films of the chest (\nFig. 1\n) showed slight cardiac enlargement, with left ventricular predominance; the lungs and pleural spaces appeared normal. Films of the paranasal sinuses revealed a thickened mucous membrane in the left maxillary antrum, without evidence of a fluid level or bone destruction; the remaining sinuses appeared clear. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and for cryoprecipitate were negative.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. John T. Harrington\\*: This 72-year-old man had long-standing hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease manifested by angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, moderate to severe peripheral vascular disease, and probably nephrosclerosis. Six years ago, when he was admitted to this hospital because of an ischemic leg ulcer, there was slight elevation of the urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, consistent with nephrosclerosis. The patient continued to be treated for hypertension with hydrochlorothiazide until three weeks before admission, when purpura erupted on his legs. A skin biopsy revealed a \"necrotizing venulitis.\" Urinalysis showed proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and, most importantly, red-cell casts.On admission the systolic blood pressure was markedly elevated, presumably due to a \"fixed\" or \"stiff\" arterial circulatory tree. Purpura and palpable petechiae were prominent, especially over the lower extremities. The important laboratory data include the ++++ test for protein in the urine, hematuria, red-cell casts, an elevated blood sedimentation rate, a normal platelet count, further elevation of the urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, and nephrotic-range proteinuria with a normal serum albumin value. A number of other tests were done, but few serologic data are furnished; we are told only that the tests for antinuclear antibodies and cryoprecipitate were negative.We thus have the problem of a patient with nonthrombocytopenic purpura, hematuria with red-cell casts, heavy proteinuria, and declining renal function. For reasons that I shall give later I believe that it would have been appropriate to have the results of assays for serum complement and cryoglobulins, serum and urine electrophoresis, a stool test for occult blood, and an immunofluorescence study of the skin-biopsy specimen before any more aggressive diagnostic procedures were performed. For example, in any patient with nephrotic-range proteinuria and a normal serum albumin level one must prove by electrophoresis that the proteinuria is indeed albuminuria and not globulinuria. I shall assume that the proteinuria was albuminuria in this patient.We need to answer several related questions in this case. First of all, what is the explanation for the palpable purpura? Secondly, what was the cause of the renal disease, which was manifested by systolic hypertension, edema, hematuria, red-cell casts, and nephrotic-range proteinuria? Thirdly, were the purpura and theSchrier[1](#core-r001) has listed four major categories of nonthrombocytopenic purpura, with several clinical entities within each. These categories are congenital disorders of vascular and connective tissue (e.g., hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and the Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome), acquired disorders of vascular and connective tissue (such as scurvy, those due to the administration of corticosteroid therapy, and amyloidosis), vasculitis (such as that associated with meningococcemia, riskettsial infection, drug-induced purpura, and idiopathic purpura \u2014 i.e., Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura), and, finally, a miscellaneous group that includes senile purpura and the rare autoerythrocytic purpura. In the last two disorders there is no renal involvement, and I shall dismiss them in this case.There is little or no clinical or laboratory evidence in this case for most of the diseases that I have mentioned. Congenital and acquired disorders of vascular and connective tissue can be eliminated except for amyloidosis. Although nephrotic-range proteinuria and renal insufficiency are often seen in patients with amyloidosis, the nephritic urinary sediment in this case is at variance with the nephrotic urinary sediment of patients with amyloidosis. Furthermore, the vascular purpura associated with amyloidosis is usually located on the neck and upper portion of the chest, not on the lower extremities as in this patient.[1](#core-r001)More important than the dearth of clinical and laboratory information is the positive information that we have \u2014 namely, the finding of \"a neutrophil-mediated necrotizing venulitis\" on biopsy of the skin, which indicates that some type of vasculitis was the cause of the palpable purpura. I believe that at least four disorders associated with vasculitis merit discussion \u2014 hypocomplementemia, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, drug-induced purpura, and Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura.Hypocomplementemic vasculitis, a newly recognized systemic disorder manifested principally by cutaneous involvement, has been described under several names in the past few years, including hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis,[2,3](#core-r002) vasculitis with urticaria,[4](#core-r004) and chronic idiopathic urticaria with hypocomplementemia.[5](#core-r005) Recently, immune-complex glomerulonephritis with nephrotic-range proteinuria (6.7 g per day) was reported in one patient with this syndrome.[6](#core-r006) All the patients tested have been found to be hypocomplementemic, and many have had hypertension, proteinuria, and hematuria, as this patient did. A renal biopsy in one case revealed enlarged, hypercellular glomeruli with an increase in the number of endothelial and mesangial cells.[6](#core-r006) A peripheral granular deposition of IgG was seen in some of the glomeruli; IgM, C3, and C4 were also present, as well as lesser amounts of IgA. A skin biopsy in that patient revealed an intense dermal infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear cells, presumably activated lymphocytes; eosinophils were not present. Granular deposits of C3 were observed in dermal blood vessels and at the dermal\u2013epidermal junction. The light-microscopical findings are similar to those in the case under discussion. We are not given the immunofluorescence findings in this case, but I suspect that they resembled those in the reported case of hypocomplementemic vasculitis that I described and that fibrin deposits were also found. Most patients with this disorder have been female, and most of them have had recurrent urticaria rather than purpura for as long as two years before the onset of renal involvement. In this case the absence of urticaria makes this diagnosis improbable, even if the serum complement level was depressed.If the complement was low I would be interested in knowing whether cryoglobulins were found in the serum, as I mentioned at the outset. Cryoglobulins are serum proteins that precipitate at temperatures usually well below body temperature. Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia has been subdivided by Brouet et al.[7](#core-r007) into three forms: Type I, in which the cryoglobulin is monoclonal immunoglobulin; Type II, a mixed form with a monoclonal component acting as an antibody against polyclonal IgG; and Type III, a mixed form, with one or more classes of polyclonal immunoglobulins and occasionally nonimmunoglobulin molecules. The inflammatory response seen with all types is due to circulating immune complexes and does not correlate directly with the plasma level of cryoglobulin. Cryoglobulins are frequently found in patients with vasculitis and may signify nothing more than the presence of immune complexes in the serum. In one series of 35 cases of necrotizing arteritis cryoglobulins were found in 15 cases.[8](#core-r008) Mixed cryoglobulinemia with purpura, skin ulcers, paresthesia, and glomerulonephritis has been reported in patients treated with thiazides.[8](#core-r008) If cryoglobulins and serum complement were normal in this case we are left with either drug-induced purpura or Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, both of which are forms of hypersensitivity vasculitis.Calabrese and Clough,[8](#core-r008) in a recent modification of the classification of vasculitis by Fauci et al.,[9](#core-r009) divided hypersensitivity vasculitis into true hypersensitivity vasculitis, Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, mixed cryoglobulinemia with vasculitis, vasculitis with connective-tissue disease or a malignant tumor, and hypocomplementemic vasculitis. The presence of palpable purpura alone, as in this patient, is highly suggestive of hypersensitivity vasculitis, although it has also been seen in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. Involvement of small vessels, especially post-capillary venules, as seen in the patient under discussion, is observed in patients with hypersensitivity vasculitis, and nuclear debris (leukocytoclasis) is also present. In this case we have no evidence of a malignant tumor or a connective-tissue disorder such as lupus, and I have already eliminated cryoglobulinemia and hypocomplementemic vasculitis.May we review the radiologic studies now?Dr. Courtney C. Neff: A film of the chest taken on admission ([Fig. 1](#f001)) is normal except for slight cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration and a large eventration of the right hemidiaphragm. Both findings are unchanged from those observed on a film of the chest taken six years earlier. The Waters' view of the sinuses demonstrates marked mucosal thickening in the left maxillary antrum, without an air-fluid level. The right antrum is clear, and the frontal sinuses and ethmoid sinuses are normal. There is no evidence of bone destruction. The nasal septum appears normal. The aortogram shows diffuse atherosclerotic changes in the aorta and its branches. The renal arteries are mildly atherosclerotic.Dr. Harrington: The radiologic findings do not contribute to our understanding of the genesis of this patient's systemic illness. In any elderly patient with progressive renal insufficiency who is known to have severe atherosclerosis it is worth considering atheroembolic renal disease. It can occur after a major abdominal operation, after arteriographic examination, as a complication of long-term anticoagulant therapy, and apparently spontaneously. Most patients with this disorder, however, do not have nephrotic-range proteinuria, but they have a sparse urinary sediment, with little hematuria. The cutaneous manifestations, which are often present, are more likely to be those of livedo reticularis rather than palpable purpura. I shall therefore dismiss this diagnosis.Approaching the problem in this case from a dermatologic viewpoint, I turned to the chapter by Rowe and Gilchrest in a dermatology textbook,[10](#core-r010) in which they discussed multisystem diseases with both renal and cutaneous involvement. Amyloidosis, diabetes, scleroderma, lupus, Fabry's disease, dysproteinemia, and Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura were stated to be the most common of these diseases. Thus, even by the cutaneous route, I come back to drug-induced purpura and Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura. In both of these disorders acute glomerulonephritis is frequent, and we have very good evidence of acute nephritis in this patient \u2014 i.e., hematuria, heavy proteinuria, and especially red-cell casts, which are virtually pathognomonic of glomerulitis.Did this patient have Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura? I don't believe so. This disorder is a form of small-vessel vasculitis with a predilection for involvement of the skin, gut, joints, and kidneys.[11](#core-r011) Although seen more frequently in children, it also occurs in adults.[12,13](#core-r012) The skin lesion, which resembles an Arthus reaction, is characterized by necrotizing vasculitis, as seen in this patient. Proliferation of glomerular mesangial and endothelial cells occurs in patients with renal involvement, and IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin deposited in the mesangium. In a series of 77 adults with Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura[11](#core-r011) 13 had involvement of the skin only, 11 had involvement of the skin and joints, 13 had involvement of the skin, gut, kidney, and joints, and 11 had involvement of the skin and kidney, the pattern exhibited by the patient under discussion. Medications were most commonly incriminated in this series of cases; in fact, one patient had taken a thiazide diuretic before the onset of the purpura. If we had no further history and the serum complement was normal we could make a clinical diagnosis of Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura in this patient and confirm it by finding IgA deposits within the kidney. Under those circumstances I would have simply observed the patient and not administered steroids as long as the renal function remained stable, since no therapy has been shown to be effective against this disorder. In fact, one could argue that a renal biopsy is not necessary as long as the renal function is stable. If the renal function were to decline precipitously I would use steroid therapy, although no good data are available to prove the value of this approach.What role did the administration of a diuretic have in this case? For a number of reasons I believe that this patient probably had cutaneous vasculitis with glomerulonephritis secondary to the use of thiazide diuretics. First of all, it has been known for many years that hypersensitivity reactions are common in association with either furosemide or thiazide diuretics.[14](#core-r014) In fact, Soter,[15](#core-r015) in a chapter on necrotizing vasculitis of the skin, stated that sulfonamides, thiazides, penicillin, and serum are the medications \"most commonly incriminated\" in patients with cutaneous vasculitis. Both furosemide and thiazides are sulfa derivatives. The hypersensitivity reactions that have been described include skin eruptions, renal vasculitis, and allergic purpura with glomerulonephritis.[16\u201319](#core-r016) In a review of 25 cases of necrotizing angiitis from one center 11 patients were found to have received thiazide diuretics.[17](#core-r017) Moreover, cutaneous vasculitic lesions redeveloped one day after a challenge dose of hydrochlorothiazide in one patient in that series. A case of allergic purpura and acute diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis was described as long ago as 1960,[19](#core-r019) just a few years after thiazides were introduced into clinical practice. I have not been able to find any data incriminating hydrochlorothiazide as a cause of allergic purpura and glomerulonephritis in a computer search of the literature of the past 12 years. I also could find no description of immunofluorescence findings in patients with alleged thiazide-induced renal vasculitis. If IgA deposits were found in this patient we shall be left with a semantic problem. Is the diagnosis simply Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, or is it diuretic-induced vasculitis with glomerulonephritis? I favor the latter diagnosis on historical grounds, although I know of no way of proving a causal relation in this patient. Rocklin and David[20](#core-r020) have shown that peripheral-blood lymphocytes from one patient with sulfa-induced vasculitis produced lymphokines in vitro when stimulated by the drug, and a study to demonstrate that finding would also be of interest in the case under discussion.In conclusion, I believe that this patient had a form of hypersensitivity vasculitis as the cause of the purpura, that the renal disease was probably acute proliferative glomerulonephritis, with or without IgA deposits, that the skin and renal diseases were intimately linked, and that the entire disorder was induced by the administration of the diuretic.Dr. Robert T. McCluskey: Dr. Fang, will you give us your thoughts when you saw this patient and provide information about the complement level and the cryoglobulins?Dr. Leslie S. Fang: The serum complement and the cryoglobulin values were obtained subsequently and were normal. I did not have information about them at the time of the biopsy. Our thoughts before the biopsy were similar to Dr. Harrington's, and we were very concerned about a hypersensitivity vasculitis. I moved to a renal biopsy before the rest of the data were available because the clinical scenario was a little disturbing. In part I was concerned about the fact that I had only two points in space \u2014 the creatinine level of 1.5 mg six years ago and the creatinine level of 2.4 mg per 100 ml at the time of admission with a ++++ test of protein.Dr. Harrington: In my opinion, the serum complement level is critically important in determining the direction of the workup and the final diagnosis in the evaluation of a patient with glomerulonephritis. Also, the rapidity with which the renal function was deteriorating would have been a major determinant of how I would have handled this patient. If the serum creatinine level had been shown to be stable for a week or two one could have proceeded in a leisurely fashion. If it had risen rapidly I would have moved to a kidney biopsy.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. McCluskey: Examination of the skin-biopsy specimen showed leukocytic infiltration in and around the walls of many of the superficial venules. The infiltrate contained both mononuclear cells and neutrophils. There was karyorrhexis with necrosis of vessel walls. Unfortunately, immunofluorescence studies were not performed on this specimen.The diagnostic procedure was a renal biopsy. The specimen consisted of renal cortical tissue and contained about 15 glomeruli. Most of the glomeruli exhibited considerable hypercellularity, which involved mesangial regions as well as peripheral loops ([Fig. 2](#f002)). There were a few neutrophils in areas of some glomeruli, as well as foci with karyorrhexis. In addition, there was partial sclerosis of many glomeruli, and fibrotic crescents were observed in two of them ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The interstitium contained irregular collections of lymphocytes and plasma cells. No vasculitis was found. Immunofluorescence studies showed conspicuous staining for IgA in the glomeruli; most of the staining was in mesangial regions, with segmental deposits along the peripheral capillary loops ([Fig. 4](#f004)). There was similar but less intense staining for IgM. IgG was not seen in most glomeruli but was found in trace amounts in some mesangial regions. C3 and C1q were present in mesangial regions and segmentally in peripheral loops. Electron-microscopical examination disclosed deposits of granular dense material in mesangial regions and in some subendothelial locations.Several weeks after the renal biopsy a second skin biopsy of a purpuric lesion was performed. Immunofluorescence study revealed IgA in the walls of small vessels in the upper dermis ([Fig. 5](#f005)) as well as IgM, C3, and fibrin or fibrinogen.The findings of glomerulonephritis and necrotizing cutaneous venulitis, with conspicuous IgA deposits in glomeruli and cutaneous vessels, are diagnostic of Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura. Although IgA-containing immune complexes are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of the lesions in this disorder the putative antigens in the complexes have not been identified and the cause of the condition is unknown. I know of no compelling evidence that drugs can induce this syndrome. The fact that Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura develops in a patient on medication does not establish a causal relation; certainly, most of the patients with this disorder do not give a history of recent drug exposure. Nevertheless, Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura may be a syndrome with multiple causes, and the possibility that drugs are responsible in rare cases cannot be eliminated.In addition to routine immunofluorescence studies the second skin-biopsy specimen was examined with monoclonal antibodies against each of the two subclasses of IgA, IgA1, and IgA2 (Bethesda Research Laboratories). The vascular-wall deposits were reactive only with the anti-IgA1 antibody.There have been conflicting reports concerning the subgroups of IgA in the glomerular deposits in cases of Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura as well as in those of IgA (Berger's) nephropathy. On the basis of a study from France in which rabbit antiserum was used Andr\u00e9 et al.[21](#core-r021) reported that IgA2 was the major constituent in patients with IgA nephropathy, Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, and cirrhosis of the liver, whereas IgA1 predominated in patients with lupus nephritis. The authors interpreted their findings as evidence of a mucosal origin of the IgA in the glomerular deposits since IgA2 is produced largely in mucosal plasma cells, whereas IgA1 is produced not only in mucosal sites but also in the spleen and bone marrow. However, Conley et al.,[22](#core-r022) in a study from the United States in which monoclonal antibodies were used, found IgA1 but not IgA2 in glomeruli in cases of Berger's nephropathy, Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, and lupus nephritis. Further studies are needed on patients from different geographic areas and with the use of different antibodies to resolve this issue.Dr. Fang, will you comment on the subsequent course of this patient and also on the medication and the possible relation of the illness to therapy?Dr. Fang: We do not know the relation between the medication and the illness, but we did not take any chances. The thiazide was discontinued. The patient has remained well since discharge from the hospital. Because of the results of the biopsies we chose to do nothing. We did not think that steroid therapy was warranted in the presence of resolution of the skin lesions. When I last saw him 3 1/2 months after the renal biopsy the cutaneous manifestation had subsided completely. He had slight residual swelling in the ankle where the inflammation had been severe, and the creatinine level was approximately the same as before, 2.3 mg per 100 ml. The urinary sediment was considerably less abnormal, although some red cells remained.Dr. McCluskey: Dr. Harrington, do you have further comments?Dr. Harrington: As I mentioned before the findings from the renal biopsy were given, we are left with a semantic problem. I agree that the findings are consistent with Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, but I still prefer to call the disease drug-induced Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura. The only way I know of proving a causal relation is by giving the patient the thiazide and seeing whether the lesion recurs. Needless to say, I would not do that. It would be of interest to see if the patient's activated lymphocytes when stimulated by thiazides produced lymphokines. If they did not that observation would eliminate my hypothesis. If the lymphocytes did react, on the other hand, the drug could have been responsible for this man's disease. I cannot argue strongly for a causal relation except, as I mentioned earlier, on historical grounds.[16\u201319](#core-r016)Dr. Fang: Has anyone rechallenged such a patient?Dr. Harrington: One patient was rechallenged, and the cutaneous vasculitis did recur.[17](#core-r017)\n",

      "question": "First admission\n. A fifty-five-year-old Greek barber was admitted to the hospital because of swelling of the legs, genitalia and abdomen.\nThe patient was well until some eight years before admission, when he first began to notice evening ankle edema, which subsided on rest at night. This persisted until about two months before entry, when the swelling became progressively worse and no longer cleared by morning. This was followed soon afterward by swelling of the genitalia and, to a lesser extent, the abdomen. During the month before admission he had experienced a sense of discomfort in both upper quadrants, with sharp pain on deep breathing. He also noticed a three-flight exertional dyspnea without orthopnea. There was no history of nausea or vomiting, hematemesis, melena or recent jaundice. His appetite was good, but he had lost about 15 pounds in weight during the last eighteen months. The patient gave a history of painless jaundice some twenty-five years before. He stated that he drank two or three glasses of wine a day. One week before admission the patient was seen in the Outpatient Clinic, where diuretics were administered with marked diminution of swelling.\nThe patient had a penile lesion twenty years before and was treated with thirty intravenous injections.\nPhysical examination revealed a well developed and well nourished man in no acute distress. There was slight icterus of the skin and scleras but no spider angiomas. The chest was clear except for a few rales in the right base. The liver edge was palpated two or three fingerbreadths below the right costal margin, and the spleen two finger-breadths below the left costal margin. There were many prominent veins over the abdomen and shifting dullness without a fluid wave. Tenderness was present in both upper quadrants. There were several external hemorrhoidal tabs, and the prostate was slightly enlarged. The lower legs showed a + + edema, varicosities and pigmentation of the skin.\nThe temperature was 99\u00b0F., the pulse 80, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 95 systolic, 60 diastolic\nThe urine was yellow and cloudy and had a specific gravity of 1.012. It gave a + + + test for albumin but contained no bile. There were 20 to 30 white cells per high-power field in the sediment. A urine smear showed rare clusters of gram-positive cocci and a urine culture grew\nStaphylococcus albus\n. The blood hemoglobin was 10 gm., and the white-cell count 3800, with 56 per cent neutrophils. The blood nonprotein nitrogen was 40 mg., and the total protein 7.11 gm. per 100 cc, with an albumin of 3.55 gm. and a globulin of 3.56 gm. The fasting blood sugar was 124 mg. per 100 cc., and the cephalin flocculation test was + + and + + + + in twenty-four and forty-eight hours; the thymol turbidity was 13.5 units, the cholesterol 241 mg. and cholesterol esters 115 mg. per 100 cc. The prothrombin time was 15 seconds (normal, 15 seconds). The serum van den Bergh reaction was 0.6 mg. per 100 cc. direct and 0.8 mg. indirect, and the alkaline phosphatase 5.2 units per 100 cc. A bromsulfalein test showed 36 per cent retention of the dye. A blood Hinton test was positive.\nA gastrointestinal series was negative. No varices were identified. The spleen was enlarged, and a roentgenogram of the chest showed only slight prominence of the left ventricle. A phenolsulfonephthalein test showed normal excretion, and a urea-clearance test gave specific gravities of 1.012, 1.015 and 1.015. The patient was advised concerning a high-calorie, high-protein, low-sodium diet and was discharged on the ninth hospital day somewhat improved. During this period in the hospital daily afternoon temperature rose to about 100\u00b0F. Four separate urine specimens showed 5 to 40 white cells per high-power field in the sediment and had specific gravities that ranged from 1.012 to 1.015. On two occasions the urine contained occasional granular and hyaline casts.\nFinal admission\n(approximately two months later). In the interval the patient noted progressive weakness and loss of appetite. One month before entry swelling of the legs, genitalia and abdomen again became marked despite diuretic therapy. An abdominal paracentesis was performed by a physician, with the removal of a considerable amount of fluid, but the abdominal swelling soon recurred. His skin became increasingly more jaundiced, and he had experienced nausea and vomiting during the three days before admission.\nThe findings on physical examination were essentially the same as those at the time of the previous admission, with the addition of pulsating neck veins.\nThe temperature was 99\u00b0F., pulse 80, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 136 systolic, 76 diastolic.\nThe urine had a specific gravity of 1.020 and gave a ++ test for albumin and bile. The sediment contained 2 or 3 red cells and 6 to 8 white cells and many hyaline and granular casts per high-power field. The blood hemoglobin was 9.5 gm. and the white-cell count 6000, with 74 per cent neutrophils. The red cells showed moderate anisocytosis and hypochromia. The blood nonprotein nitrogen was 35 mg., and the total protein 7.85 gm. per 100 cc., with an albumin of 3.08 gm. and a globulin of 4.77 gm. The cephalin flocculation test was + + + and + + + + in twenty-four and forty-eight hours. The serum van den Bergh reaction was 6.0 mg. per 100 cc. direct and 8.4 mg. indirect, and the alkaline phosphatase was 5.4 units per 100 cc. The prothrombin time was 21 seconds (normal, 15 seconds).\nThe patient became increasingly more drowsy and icteric, ate little and vomited frequently. The edema did not respond to the usual therapy. On the eighth hospital day after being comatose for twenty-four hours, he died.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Jacob Lerman: I should like to know if mention is made of treatment for the urinary infection during the first admission.Dr. Tracy B. Mallory: There is no notation about therapy for pyelitis.Dr. Lerman: The initial symptoms could be explained either by right-sided heart failure or by the beginning of portal obstruction or portal cirrhosis. The slow development of edema, first in the legs and then in the abdomen, and finally the enlargement of the liver suggest the course of events that one sees in right-sided failure. However, he had no symptoms of right-sided failure. Mention is made of three-flight dyspnea. That is normal for all of us. There was no respiratory distress on examination. In spite of the type of onset, there was no evidence of cardiac involvement. He had an episode of painless jaundice, which does not seem to have much bearing on the problem. No doubt the intake of wine is of importance in this particular eastern Mediterranean race. He had evidence of acquired syphilis as indicated by a positive blood Hinton reaction; it may have played an important role.On physical examination he had mild icterus, enlargement of the liver and spleen, fluid in the abdomen, prominent veins over the abdomen, hemorrhoids, varicosities and edema of the legs \u2014 all of which fit the diagnosis of portal cirrhosis. I cannot explain why he had such a low blood pressure. Undoubtedly he had a urinary infection. Evidence in the record indicates some degree of pyelonephritis. In addition, the abdominal pain, the anemia, the leukopenia, the reversed albumin-globulin ratio, the positive cephalin-flocculation test, the low cholesterol esters of 115 mg. per 100 cc. of a total of 241 mg., the bromsulfalein retention all speak for liver damage of the type one sees in portal cirrhosis. I assume that the fever was due to urinary infection, although fever is not uncommon in cirrhotic patients.May we see the x-ray films?Dr. James J. McCort: An examination of the gastrointestinal tract was made at the time of admission. The spot films of the esophagus show normal rugae without evidence of varices. The stomach shows no definite abnormality. There is a small diverticulum in the third portion of the duodenum. It is apparent that the spleen is enlarged and pressing on the stomach. There is also some enlargement of the left lobe of the liver as shown by the compression of the stomach.The chest film taken on admission reveals clear lung fields. The heart is slightly prominent in the region of the left ventricle; there is no bulging anteriorly to indicate right-sided heart enlargement. It can be seen that the right leaf of the diaphragm is slightly higher than usual. A film of the chest at the time of the second admission, two months later, discloses an increase in vascular markings in both lung fields. The right leaf of the diaphragm is higher, and there is a small amount of fluid in the right costophrenic angle, posteriorly. A slight under-aeration of the right lower lobe may be secondary to the high right leaf of the diaphragm.Dr. Lerman: Can you judge whether or not the left lobe of the liver is the larger portion?Dr. McCort: No, a film of the entire abdomen was not obtained.Dr. Lerman: The subsequent rapid downhill course, in addition to the x-ray appearance of increased vascular congestion and the pulsating neck veins, again raises the question of congestive failure. It may be just incidental to the major problem. As I said before, all the facts so far seem to favor a diagnosis of ordinary portal cirrhosis.We must consider other diagnoses such as syphilitic cirrhosis or gumma of the liver. The additional evidence that the left lobe of the liver was large is a characteristic finding in syphilitic cirrhosis. This is not sufficient evidence, however, to make the diagnosis, but it is suggestive. On the other hand, it is difficult to know whether syphilitic cirrhosis is different from ordinary portal cirrhosis. Many people believe that they are one and the same thing. Gumma is somewhat different. A gumma usually appears in the left lobe. It is the only suggestive bit of evidence. Hemochromatosis may be mentioned because he had pigmentation of the leg, but he did not have pigmentation elsewhere or evidence of diabetes. I assume that the pigmentation was due to stasis dermatitis associated with varicosities. Amyloid disease should be mentioned, even though there was no obvious cause for amyloidosis, other than possibly cirrhosis it-self. The presence of a large liver and spleen and the albuminuria are consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis. Unfortunately, we have no other evidence, such as a Congo-red test. We can only mention it. Even primary amyloidosis might be a possibility.Hepatoma should be mentioned, particularly in view of the rapid downhill course following the initial admission. The description of the liver is certainly not suggestive of hepatoma. Yet, in the presence of cirrhosis of long standing, rapid down-hill course and weight loss, there is a good possibility that he had hepatoma. This produced sufficient obstruction to the biliary radicles to cause rapid liver failure.We should also discuss the cause of death. Obviously he died from cholemia. What are the possibilities? I have already mentioned the co-existence of hepatoma. In addition, a patient with cirrhosis is rather subject to episodes of hepatitis or degeneration of the liver. I have seen several patients with portal cirrhosis who suddenly developed acute or subacute yellow atrophy or some sort of change in the cells that may be labeled hepatitis. The course here would suggest that he developed some such process as subacute yellow atrophy.I must conclude with a diagnosis of portal cirrhosis, probably hepatoma, and probably a superimposed subacute degenerative process, such as subacute yellow atrophy.Dr. Alfred Kranes: When Dr. Lerman says \"portal\" does he mean of the so-called alcoholic type?Dr. Lerman: Yes.Dr. Kranes: May not the previous history of jaundice have been a factor in the later development of cirrhosis? It is hard to tell from the history. One wonders if it was due to arsenic. Apparently he had syphilis twenty years previously and was treated with arsenic.Dr. Lerman: One would expect the late damage from arsenic or hepatitis to develop within a few years, or there would be recurrent episodes of this damage as is so often observed following hepatitis \u2014 until it ends up in biliary.cirrhosis.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Mallory: The exterior surface of the liver showed the coarse granularity characteristic of a long-standing cirrhosis. The dome of the right lobe showed in addition a large nodule 6 cm. in diameter that projected upward 2 to 3 cm. from the surrounding tissue. When the liver was sectioned sagittally it was evident that the inferior vena cava was completely filled with a tumor thrombus that extended up into the right auricle of the heart. Tracing the tumor backward in sections of the liver, it was obvious that the hepatic veins were occluded, and there was a primary tumor in the liver substance occupying a considerable part of the right lobe. Histologically, it was a hepatoma, a primary liver-cell carcinoma, developing as it almost invariably does in a liver that has been cirrhotic for a long period. The cirrhosis itself was old and inactive. Beyond saying that it was a portal cirrhosis, I cannot classify it further. I cannot say whether or not it might have been a result of previous hepatitis or a result of alcoholism \u2014 greater than admitted. There was evidence of acute degeneration of liver cells in many parts of the organ itself, infarct-like in character and secondary to the numerous vascular occlusions. No distant metastases were found grossly, but in microscopical sections of the lung a very large proportion of the minute pulmonary arteries were solidly plugged with tumor thrombi, and quite probably in the terminal days or few weeks of life there was pulmonary hypertension and an element of cor pulmonale.Dr. Edward B. Benedict: How common are tumor thrombi with hepatoma?Dr. Mallory: Four cases out of 5 invade the intrahepatic veins, usually the hepatic, sometimes the portal radicles. It is an exceptional case in which the tumor thrombus occludes the vena cava and grows into the right auricle, but we have seen it on several occasions. The one other tumor in which invasion of veins is equally extensive is hypernephroma, which can also grow up the vena cava and directly in the auricle.\n",

      "question": "A 35-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of a pelvic mass, a productive cough, and known pulmonary adenocarcinomatous metastases.\nShe was well until two months earlier, when a cough developed, worsened progressively, and became productive of frothy mucoid sputum. She observed painless swelling of the right leg and had diarrhea of three weeks' duration. Seven weeks before admission the patient consulted a physician, who found a tender mass in the pelvis and both lower abdominal quadrants. An x-ray film of the chest was reported to be normal. An ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen was reported to show a cystic and solid mass in the region of the left ovary and a similar smaller mass on the right side posteriorly. An inhaler was prescribed, and the patient was referred to a gynecologist, who found a pelvic mass and admitted her to another hospital. An electrocardiogram was normal. An x-ray film of the chest revealed mild cardiac enlargement, with pulmonary vascular congestion and coarsening of the pulmonary interstitial markings; a moderate right pleural effusion was present. Venographic examination of the right leg demonstrated compression of the right iliofemoral vein by a pelvic mass; no intraluminal filling defects were seen. Repeated x-ray films of the chest revealed no change; a right pleural effusion and diffusely accentuated linear lung markings were again evident. An echocardiographic study disclosed a minimal pericardial effusion and was otherwise negative. A mammogram was reported to be normal. An exploratory laparotomy was planned but was canceled because of severe coughing. A culture of sputum yielded a normal throat flora. A right-sided thoracentesis was performed, and Cytologic examination disclosed numerous mesothelial cells, without evidence of a malignant tumor. Microscopical examination of a biopsy specimen obtained at a bronchoscopic examination showed \"metastatic adenocarcinoma with extensive vascular invasion.\" The patient was referred to this hospital.\nThe patient was a native of Portugal and immigrated to the United States at the age of 12 years. She stated that she had worked in a plastics factory for 10 years, then a glue company for 8 1/2 years, and subsequently as an assembly controller for 8 1/2 years. She was married, with a history of five pregnancies that eventuated in three normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries, one postpartum hemorrhage with retained products of conception, and one spontaneous abortion. A tonsillectomy was performed at the age of 13 years, and a tubal ligation was performed at the age of 33 years, with a negative pelvic examination at that time. Menarche occurred at 11 years of age; the menses were regular and lasted for three days, without cramps or intermenstrual spotting. The last menstrual period occurred 29 days before entry. There was a history of incontinence with coughing, progressive fatigue, abdominal distention, pelvic \"pressure,\" and one-flight dyspnea of six weeks' duration; the patient slept on two pillows because of increased coughing when she was lying flat. There was a history of asthma in the patient's mother. There was no history of fever, chest pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel habit, urinary frequency, dysuria, drug allergy, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, hepatitis, peptic ulcer, use of tobacco or alcohol, or weight loss. There was no family history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, or cancer.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse was 92, and the respirations were 30. The blood pressure was 120/90 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared well except for occasional coughing. No lymphadenopathy was found. The head and neck were normal. Examination of the lungs showed coarse breath sounds at the left base and signs of consolidation at the right base. The heart and breasts were normal. The abdomen was soft; an infraumbilical scar of tubal ligation was well healed. A large, firm, irregular, slightly tender mass was palpated in the left lower portion of the abdomen. Pelvic examination disclosed an irregular, hard mass in the pelvis and abdomen, 16 by 14 by 14 cm, that was contiguous with the uterus on the left side. No implants were palpable in the cul-de-sac or pelvic sidewalk Brawny edema was present in the right lower extremity, without pitting, tenderness, or Homans' sign. Neurologic examination was negative.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 46.7 percent; the white-cell count was 10,400, with 75 percent neutrophils, 19 percent lymphocytes, and 6 percent monocytes; the platelet count was 347,000. The prothrombin time was 9.1 seconds, with a control of 10.8 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 27.8 seconds. The urea nitrogen was 3 mmol per liter (7 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 5.3 mmol per liter (96 mg per 100 ml), the conjugated bilirubin 7 \u03bcmol per liter (0.4 mg per 100 ml), and the total bilirubin 19 \u03bcmol per liter (1.1 mg per 100 ml). The sodium was 140 mmol, the potassium 3.9 mmol, the chloride 103 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 25 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) was 14 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 45 U per liter. A stool test for occult blood was negative. An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 86, with minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. X-ray films of the chest revealed an increase in the right pleural effusion but were otherwise unchanged; diffuse prominent linear opacities were observed throughout both lungs; the cardiac silhouette was enlarged and unchanged from an earlier examination.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Stephen L. Curry\\*: In summary, we have the problem of a 35-year-old multigravida with a seven-week history of progressive pulmonary symptoms, a rapidly enlarging left pelvic mass, a right pleural effusion with a negative thoracentesis, and a biopsy diagnosis at the referring hospital of metastatic adenocarcinoma to the lung with extensive vascular invasion. She was from Portugal, had five pregnancies, and underwent a tubal ligation two years before admission. Also important is the apparently short duration of her illness.In evaluating this case one must consider three categories of tumor. First of all, the patient could have had an adenocarcinoma of nongynecologic origin with a benign adnexal mass or uterine leiomyoma. Secondly, she could have had a nongynecologic malignant tumor that had metastasized to the ovary. Finally, the origin of the cancer could have been gynecologic. Of utmost importance would have been a careful histologic evaluation of the biopsy specimens from the other hospital. Indeed, no patient should ever undergo a surgical exploration or treatment for cancer without careful evaluation of all the slides from another hospital.I shall turn my attention first to Meigs' syndrome, which was first described in the English literature by Dr. Joe V. Meigs at this hospital.[1](#core-r001) The classic Meigs' syndrome consists of an ovarian fibroma, ascites, and a right pleural effusion. Occasionally, a large uterine myoma, especially if it is pedunculated, can cause ascites and a pleural effusion, as described in this case. If either of these diagnoses were correct one would have to assume the presence of an adenocarcinoma of the lung as a second disease, and there is an old axiom in medicine that one rarely considers multiple diseases in the differential diagnosis in patients under the age of 40 years.Turning to the possibility of a nongynecologic malignant tumor with metastasis to the ovaries and the lung as the cause of all this patient's problems, I mustconsider primary sites in the gastrointestinal tract and breast. In this 35-year-old Portuguese woman the two most likely primary sites would have been the stomach or breast. Presumably, breast cancer was ruled out by the negative physical examination and the negative mammographie study. A malignant tumor of the lower gastrointestinal tract is still a possibility despite the negative Hemoccult test. However, if this patient had a nongynecologic primary malignant tumor I believe that a gastric carcinoma would have been the most likely source. Her age and country of origin are consistent with an increased risk for this cancer.The final and most likely possibility is a gynecologic malignant tumor that had metastasized to the lung. This patient could have had ovarian, uterine, or cervical cancer or even gestational trophoblastic disease. I shall discuss each of these possibilities in reverse order of likelihood from my evaluation of this case.The least likely possibility is that this patient had a primary adenocarcinoma of the endocervix that metastasized to the ovaries and to the lung. Her age and parity are consistent with that diagnosis. However, she had had no abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge, and physical examination did not indicate any abnormality of the cervix. I should emphasize at this point that careful palpation of the cervix and paracervical tissue is an important part of the routine examination of every female patient. An endocervical Papanicolaou smear and a careful rectal examination should always be part of every pelvic examination. The paracervical tissues are best evaluated by a rectovaginal examination.Secondly, the source of this patient's malignant tumor could have been the endometrium. The parenchymal lung metastases are consistent with that diagnosis. Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium may also metastasize to the ovaries. On the other hand, this patient's age, parity, and lack of abnormal bleeding are inconsistent with the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. It would be very unusual to find such an aggressive, widely metastasizing, rapidly growing tumor in such a young patient, but recently described and fortunately rare histologic varieties, such as serous papillary adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, could present in this manner. We recently cared for an unfortunate 31-year-old patient who died within nine months of the diagnosis of a rapidly progressing adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.If the histopathologic diagnosis from the referring hospital is incorrect, there is a strong possibility that this patient had a gestational choriocarcinoma. The aggressive nature of the disease, indicated by the very short duration of the patient's symptoms and the pulmonary biopsy showing extensive vascular invasion, raises the suspicion of a choriocarcinoma. She had been pregnant in the past, and it is well known that this disease can occur many years after the last pregnancy. The history of tubal ligation certainly does not rule out that diagnosis. It would be unusual to see such a large adnexal mass without any evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding. However, it could have been the result of multiple lutein cysts stimulated by a high human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secretion from a choriocarcinoma. The more common pulmonary finding would be the presence of large round, fluffy parenchymal lesions. Also, in such cases thoracentesis usually shows gross blood, since the choriocarcinoma is a very vascular lesion. Review of the slides from the other hospital and a test for the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin would have substantiated this diagnosis.Finally, it is most likely that this patient had a primary ovarian cancer. There are three major categories of ovarian cancer \u2014 those arising from germ cells, those arising from the stroma, and those arising from the surface epithelium. This patient's presentation was not specific for any of these three categories.Stromal tumors of the ovary can occur at any age and are notable for their ability to produce hormones. The androgen-producing tumors are consistently diagnosed at a very early stage, since the bizarre physical changes of defeminization followed by masculinization lead to an early diagnosis in the great majority of the patients. The estrogen-producing tumors, most commonly the granulosa-cell tumor, can produce a picture such as that seen in this patient. It would be extremely rare for them to be so aggressive, however, and one would expect a history of abnormal vaginal bleeding.Since the patient under discussion had a large left adnexal mass, a right adnexal mass, and pulmonary metastatic cancer, I must consider the possibility of a primary epithelial ovarian cancer. Her age, the absence of cul-de-sac nodularity, and the presence of bronchial metastases make this diagnosis improbable. I would expect examination of a pleural effusion to show malignant-tumor cells in such a case, but they are not always found. If this woman did have an epithelial malignant tumor it is most likely that the histologic type was either a clear-cell or an endometrioid carcinoma, since they seem to have the most bizarre metastatic patterns.In my review of the findings in this case I think that the most likely diagnosis is a malignant germ-cell tumor of the ovary. This type of cancer is seen at a young age, and 35 years of age would be near the upper end of the spectrum for one of these tumors. On the other hand, they usually present as rapidly enlarging pelvic masses that cause pain and discomfort early in the course. Although a dysgerminoma is the most common type, an immature teratoma would be the one most compatible with the picture in this patient. A malignant teratoma may contain a large component of mucinous adenocarcinoma. One must be careful to distinguish the immature teratoma from the mature teratoma (dermoid cyst) with malignant change. The most common malignant tumor associated with a dermoid cyst is a squamous-cell carcinoma originating in the skin-like elements of the cyst. The immature teratoma, which is almost always solid, contains mature as well as immature tissue on histologic examination. The other possibility is a primary choriocarcinoma of the ovary metastasizing to the lung with extensive vascular involvement. The ovarian choriocarcinoma, which is usually not of gestational origin, does not produce hCG at a level that reflects its volume or its response to therapy.In summary, I believe that this patient had a primary ovarian tumor, probably a germ-cell tumor, and that careful evaluation of the slides from the other hospital, serum assays for hCG and alpha-fetoprotein levels, and exploratory laparotomy were indicated.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Pomerantz, will you give us the medical students' diagnosis?Dr. Roger J. Pomerantz: The medical students considered a number of diagnoses that included choriocarcinoma of the uterus, primary choriocarcinoma of the ovary, immature teratoma, and adenocarcinoma metastatic to the ovary, or the so-called Krukenberg tumor. On the basis of the pace of the progression of the disease and the diffuse pulmonary involvement they favored a Krukenberg tumor and suggested the stomach as the most likely source. The diagnostic procedure was thought to be a laparotomy.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Scully: Dr. Fuller, you followed this patient. Will you tell us your impressions and then describe the diagnostic procedure?Dr. Arlan F. Fuller, Jr.: This patient had been well until she presented with a very troublesome cough, as Dr. Curry indicated. During the course of her evaluation we were concerned, as was he, that she might have an extraovarian tumor. For that reason a mammographic examination was obtained before admission to this hospital and was negative. On pelvic examination initially in the office there was no evidence of cul-de-sac nodularity, which might have suggested metastatic tumor. I considered the possibility of bilateral tumors because I could easily feel a large anterior mass, and in the cul-de-sac there was another mass about which I was less certain. When she was taken to the operating room, examination under anesthesia again revealed no evidence of cul-desac spread, but there were two definable masses, both of them mobile without evidence of extension to the uterus. At the time of the laparotomy preliminary examination of the abdominal cavity was negative except for the pelvis, where there were two masses. One was on the left side, about 16 by 14 cm. The uterus appeared to be normal except for slight enlargement. The right ovary resembled the left ovary but was smaller, approximately 6 cm in diameter. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy, and accordingly we removed the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and uterus. While waiting for the results of frozen-section examination we explored the upper portion of the abdomen, looking for an extraovarian primary tumor. The pancreas and colon were normal. Some enlarged celiac lymph nodes could be identified, and there was slight induration on the lesser curvature of the stomach. On the basis of the preliminary evaluation by the pathologist the ovarian tumors did not appear to be primary. We investigated the area of induration on the lesser curvature of the stomach further and asked Dr. Paul C. Shellito to examine it endoscopically. He observed loss of normal mucosal folds. Biopsy specimens were obtained from the area of induration on the lesser curvature. After completion of that procedure, with no evidence of any other abnormality except for a few slightly enlarged pelvic lymph nodes, we removed those nodes and closed the incision.Dr. Scully: What was the interpretation of the ultrasound examination?Dr. Fuller: The ultrasound examination was not very helpful. Solid masses of indeterminate number were described, and it provided little additional information other than the absence of hydronephrosis.Dr. Robert H. Young: We received the uterus, both ovaries and fallopian tubes, right and left pelvic lymph nodes, a segment of omentum, and gastric-biopsy specimens. The left ovarian tumor was 600 g and 14.5 by 14 by 11 cm. It had a lobulated, focally granular external surface. Sectioning revealed solid, tan, firm tissue that was focally mucoid and focally cystic ([Fig. 1](#f001)). The right ovarian mass was 100 g and 8 by 8 by 4 cm. It was similar to the left ovarian tumor on inspection of its external and sectioned surfaces. The uterus, fallopian tubes, pelvic lymph nodes, and omentum were grossly normal. The gastric-biopsy specimens consisted of six pieces of white tissue 0.5 cm in aggregate diameter.Microscopical examination of the ovarian tumor showed clusters, cords, and nests of cells as well as single cells, many of which had an eccentric nucleus and pale cytoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)) that was strongly positive on mucin staining. These signet-ring cells were dispersed in a stroma that varied from moderately cellular to loose and edematous. Although most of the tumor cells had the typical features of signet-ring cells, a minority did not and were characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The overall microscopical appearance of the tumor was that of a Krukenberg tumor. Blood vessels and lymphatics in both ovaries contained tumor, and there was prominent lymphatic invasion by signet-ring-cell carcinoma in the fallopian tubes, myometrium, and omentum. Four of 4 right pelvic lymph nodes and 9 of 10 left pelvic lymph nodes contained metastatic carcinoma. Examination of the gastric-biopsy specimens showed numerous signet-ring cells in the lamina propria ([Fig. 3](#f003)).The great majority of metastatic gastric carcinomas to the ovary are Krukenberg tumors. These tumors typically form large, coarsely lobulated masses with yellow or white sectioned surfaces. The consistency is characteristically firm, but fleshy, gelatinous, or spongy areas are common. Occasionally, the gross presentation is atypical, with large, thin-walled cysts containing mucinous or watery fluid separated by relatively small amounts of solid tissue. The tumor is bilateral in approximately 80 percent of the cases. These tumors are defined on the basis of their microscopical appearance \u2014 specifically, their predominant composition of mucin-filled signet-ring cells, which typically lie within a cellular stroma derived from the ovarian stroma.[2\u20136](#core-r002) As in this case, the stroma is sometimes focally prominently edematous. Most Krukenberg tumors are of gastric origin, usually arising in the pylorus. The large intestine, appendix, and breast are the next most common primary sites; carcinomas of the gallbladder, biliary tract, cervix, and urinary bladder are rare sources of these tumors.[2](#core-r002) In an autopsy study Saphir[7](#core-r007) demonstrated that signet-ring-cell carcinomas are associated with ovarian metastasis more often than carcinomas of other histologic types, by a ratio of about 4 to 1. In a recent study that supported his observations, gastric signet-ring-cell carcinomas metastasized to the ovary in 41 percent of the cases, whereas gastric carcinomas of intestinal type did so in only 17 percent.[8](#core-r008)The frequency of the Krukenberg tumor varies with that of gastric carcinoma in the population analyzed. In Japan, where there is a high prevalence of gastric carcinoma and a low prevalence of primary ovarian carcinoma, the Krukenberg tumor accounts for a large proportion of all ovarian cancers. The Krukenberg tumor is most common in the fifth decade, but from 28 to 44 percent of the patients have been under the age of 40 years[5,6,9](#core-r005) ; only slightly more than 10 percent are over 60 years of age.[5,9](#core-r005) This age distribution is related in part to the disproportionate frequency of gastric signet-ring-cell carcinomas in young women. In a recent review of gastric carcinoma occurring in patients 35 years old or less, 2 of 19 women had ovarian metastases.[10](#core-r010)Microscopical examination of Krukenberg tumors may reveal other features in addition to the typical ones seen in the case under discussion. Small glands are occasionally prominent, and some tumors have a tubular architecture that may cause them to be confused with Sertoli-Leydig-cell tumors.[11](#core-r011) Mucin-poor tumor cells growing in trabeculae and large masses may be seen, and abundant collagen formation, marked stromal edema, and cell-free pools of mucin in the stroma are other occasional features.[2](#core-r002) Sometimes cysts lined by mucinous epithelium with a slightly atypical appearance are conspicuous, with more characteristic areas lying between the cysts. In some cases the cytoplasm of the signet-ring cells is granular and eosinophilic rather than pale and vacuolated, and the cytoplasm may have a bull's-eye appearance, containing a large vacuole with a central eosinophilic body. Lutein cells are occasionally present in the stroma, particularly if the patient is pregnant.Almost 90 percent of patients with a Krukenberg tumor have symptoms related to ovarian involvement, such as abdominal pain and swelling. Occasionally, there is abnormal uterine bleeding. Rarely, there are overt signs of excessive hormone production such as virilization, a feature explained by the presence of the luteinized stromal cells in some cases. The remaining patients have gastrointestinal or miscellaneous symptoms or are asymptomatic. A history of prior carcinoma, usually gastric, can be obtained in approximately a third of the cases.[5,9](#core-r005) The interval between the diagnosis of a gastric carcinoma and the subsequent discovery of ovarian involvement is usually six months or less,[9](#core-r009) but intervals as long as 12 years have been reported.[5](#core-r005) In most cases the diagnosis of the gastric carcinoma is made preoperatively, during the operation for the ovarian metastases, or within a few months thereafter. Sometimes the primary tumor is too small to be detected at operation,[6](#core-r006) and examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract with barium may fail to reveal evidence of a tumor even after the diagnosis of a Krukenberg tumor has been established.[5,6](#core-r005) Rarely, the gastric carcinoma is not detected until five or more years after discovery of the metastatic tumor in the ovary.Almost all the patients die within a year of the diagnosis of the ovarian metastasis, with an average duration of seven months from the diagnosis to death,[5](#core-r005) but rare patients have survived, apparently free of tumor, for as long as six years after gastrectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.[6](#core-r006) This observation justifies removal of the stomach and the ovarian metastases in cases in which the tumor appears limited to those organs, in the hope of a possible cure. It is also advisable to remove the ovaries routinely in menopausal and post-menopausal women who undergo a gastric resection for carcinoma to prevent the later complication of ovarian metastasis and avoid another operation.Dr. Curry: I am not concerned that the ultrasono-graphic examination was not available for review in this case. I believe that pelvic ultrasound studies are overused in gynecologic practice. In this patient with an easily palpable adnexal mass an ultrasound study would have added nothing to the management of her care. In retrospect, it is obvious that an upper gastrointestinal series or a gastroscopic examination, or both, would have been the most appropriate diagnostic tests. I commend the students on their accurate diagnosis. I wonder if Dr. Fuller can give us follow-up information on this patient.Dr. Fuller: As Dr. Curry noted, in the absence of mammographic abnormalities we believed that this disease probably originated in the abdomen and that further radiographic studies would not alter our decision to proceed with a laparotomy and would only add to the cost of her hospital course.After the patient's postoperative recovery she was seen in consultation by Dr. Smith and started on cytotoxic chemotherapy with fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and mitomycin.Dr. David B. Smith: At the outset the only remarkable feature of the patient's examination was persistent swelling of the right thigh and lower leg, which was not painful. She tolerated the drugs well, with the usual nausea and vomiting, but there were no interruptions in the doses because of myelosuppression. Despite chemotherapy she experienced vague right-lower-quadrant distress within two months of the operation, and at three months she once again had shifting dullness and abdominal distention. In the ensuing week she visited the Emergency Ward three times because of dyspnea and abdominal distention requiring paracentesis. With this procedure 4 liters of chylous ascitic fluid with signet-ring-carcinoma cells were removed each time, relieving the symptoms temporarily. Subsequent visits to the Emergency Ward for the same problem revealed not only chylous ascites but also bilateral pleural effusions; cytologic examination of the pleural fluid was also positive for tumor cells, but the effusions were not chylous. She was finally admitted to the hospital for another paracentesis followed by a computed tomographic (CT) scan, which showed a mass in the region of the pancreatic head, thought to represent lymphadenopathy and thickening of the gastric wall. The intraperitoneal administration of bleomycin was not helpful in controlling the accumulation of ascitic fluid. Chest-tube sclerotherapy was attempted but was complicated by an air leak and inability to drain the pleural space completely. She began to have persistent vomiting after eating suggestive of a gastric-outlet obstruction; she did not wish to have a nasogastric tube placed. She was kept comfortable with narcotics and anti-emetics. In the last days hyperkalemia, with a potassium level of 7.0 mmol, and hyponatremia, with a sodium level of 117 mmol per liter, occurred despite a normal serum cortisol level. Anasarca also developed. She aspirated and died about four months after the operation. Permission for an autopsy was not obtained.\n",

      "question": "A 34-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of a dry cough, exertional dyspnea, and interstitial pulmonary disease.\nThe patient had been well until three months earlier, when she experienced the insidious onset of fatigue and mild exertional dyspnea. An antibiotic was prescribed, with temporary improvement. Two months before entry she began to have mild night sweats and had an intermittent low-grade fever. Two weeks before admission a cough developed, and the dyspnea worsened slightly; a physician prescribed clarithromycin and an inhaler, without improvement. On the day of admission the patient was seen at another hospital, where radiographs of the chest showed a patchy interstitial infiltrate that was most marked in the upper lung zones. She was referred to this hospital.\nThe patient worked at night as an aide in a nursing home, without known exposure to tuberculosis or other respiratory tract diseases. X-ray films of the chest obtained two years before entry were said to be normal, and a routine tuberculin skin test six months before admission was negative. The patient had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drank beer infrequently. She had lost 6.8 kg in weight during her illness. There was no history of exposure to cats, farm animals, chemicals, or industrial dusts, sputum production, hemoptysis, chills, chest pain, rash, arthralgia, recent travel, or risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\nThe temperature was 37.7 \u00b0C, the pulse was 120, and the respirations were 32. The blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg.\nOn physical examination the patient was an obese woman who was comfortable at rest. No rash or lymphadenopathy was found. The head and neck were normal. The lungs were clear, and the heart, breasts, and abdomen were normal. There was no peripheral edema, clubbing, or cyanosis. Neurologic examination was negative.\nThe urine was normal. The hematologic and chemical values are presented in\nTable 1\nand\nTable 2\n. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110 and was normal. Radiographs of the chest (\nFigure 1\n) revealed a diffuse parenchymal abnormality that was characterized by diffuse cysts, 2 to 10 mm, throughout both lungs, with sparing of the costophrenic angles; there were also diffuse, irregular nodular opacities, 3 to 5 mm, bilaterally; the lung volumes appeared normal, and the superior mediastinum and heart size were normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest (\nFigure 2\n) disclosed bilateral cystic and nodular lesions, 2 to 10 mm, in the middle and upper lung zones with sparing of the bases; the lesions were distributed evenly throughout the affected portions of the lungs; bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy was present; no pleural effusions were seen; small apical bullae were observed. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing room air, showed that the partial pressure of oxygen was 83 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide 38 mm Hg, and the pH 7.45. A tuberculin skin test (PPD, 5 TU) was negative, and a skin test with mumps antigen was positive. The level of angiotensin-converting enzyme was normal. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-HIV antibodies were negative. Microscopical examination of stained specimens of sputum showed moderate numbers of neutrophils and a mixed bacterial flora; no acid-fast bacilli were seen; a fungal preparation revealed budding yeasts that were later identified as Candida albicans. Serologic tests for causative agents of hypersensitivity pneumonitis were negative. Examination with a flexible bronchoscope revealed no abnormality except for mild edema at the origin of the right-upper-lobe bronchus. Microscopical examination of bronchial washings showed no red cells and 1250 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 86 percent were neutrophils, 3 percent lymphocytes, 1 percent monocytes, and 10 percent eosinophils; microscopical examination of specially prepared specimens disclosed no Pneumocystis carinii or acid-fast bacilli; budding yeasts with pseudohyphae were seen in one specimen. Cultures of the washings yielded a normal respiratory tract flora and C. albicans. Cytologic examination of the washings showed squamous metaplasia with reactive changes and no malignant-tumor cells. Microscopical examination of a transbronchial-biopsy specimen revealed focal fibrosis and intraalveolar fibrin; no malignant-tumor cells or granulomas were seen, and no microorganisms were observed on specially stained preparations. The results of pulmonary-function studies are presented in\nTable 3\n.\nSpecimens of blood, urine, and sputum were obtained for culture. The temperature ranged as high as 37.4 to 37.8 \u00b0C daily. Erythromycin was administered orally and by vein and was discontinued after a specimen of urine showed no evidence of legionella antigen. All culture specimens yielded no pathogenic microorganisms.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Barry W. Levine[\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic findings?Dr. Meenakshi Bhalla: A radiograph of the chest ([Figure 1](#f01)) shows bilateral nodular opacities no larger than 1 cm in diameter, which are focally confluent, with relative sparing of the basal segments and costophrenic angles. The lung volumes are preserved. The CT scan of the chest ([Figure 2](#f02)) confirms the presence of focally confluent nodules, most of which are cavitated centrally. There is also mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.Dr. Levine: The evaluation of diffuse interstitial lung disease has changed as newer diagnostic techniques have become available. In the past a thorough review of the history, including all occupational and environmental exposures, a family history, and a complete review of systems, was needed. All the physical findings were reviewed to identify a systemic disorder that could cause the interstitial process. As a result, the cause of an interstitial process could often be identified without the need for an open-lung biopsy. These causes included pneumoconioses, radiation, drug-induced changes, and diseases associated with various clinically recognized autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis. In cases of diseases such as histiocytosis X the diagnosis could also be made on clinical grounds if either diabetes insipidus or bone lesions were present. In most cases, however, the diagnosis was not apparent until an open-lung biopsy was performed. New diagnostic techniques that often preclude the need for an open-lung biopsy include transbronchial-lung biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, thoracoscopic examination, and standard and high-resolution CT studies of the chest. Despite all these techniques, however, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis often remains idiopathic.The case under discussion has several features germane to the differential diagnosis. The disorder had been present for less than two years and was associated with fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The patient was a smoker and relatively young. She was not anergic but had a negative tuberculin skin test. The workup for hypersensitivity was negative, as was the bacteriologic evaluation. The most pertinent points in her presentation were the radiologic findings and the moderately severe restrictive defect shown on pulmonary-function evaluation, with a total lung capacity of 60 percent of the predicted value. There was virtually no impairment of gas exchange, as indicated by normal arterial-blood gas values and a normal carbon monoxide diffusion capacity after correction for lung volume. However, the airways resistance and residual volume were elevated. I do not think that the increased airways resistance in this case was associated with the restrictive defect, since airways resistance does not begin to increase in restrictive lung disease until the lung volume falls well below the predicted functional residual capacity. Because there was also elevation in the residual volume, the disorder must have involved both the parenchyma and the airways. A variety of diseases can cause such physiologic changes, including bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and eosinophilic granuloma of the lung.The salient radiographic features in this case are the predominantly upper-lobe disease with cysts of 2 to 10 mm, bilateral nodules with sparing of the lung bases and costophrenic angles, small apical bullae, and bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.The increase in airways resistance and residual volume, the multiple pulmonary cysts, and the patient's age and sex raise the possibility of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, which occurs exclusively in women 17 to 47 years of age[1](#core-r001). Pathological examination of the lungs shows multiple cysts that usually are a few millimeters in diameter but occasionally are larger. The cyst walls are formed by masses of smooth-muscle cells and bronchial epithelium[2](#core-r002). Focal emphysema develops, partly because of the narrowing of small airways by smooth-muscle proliferation[1](#core-r001). Fibrosis may occur, but the muscular hyperplasia is much more extensive than that in interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and is associated with the lymphatic spaces[3](#core-r003). The peribronchial muscular hyperplasia can increase airways resistance, causing air trapping and an increase in residual volume. Dynamic ultrafast high-resolution tomographic study of the chest has recently shown an association between the lung cysts in patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis and those in patients with eosinophilic granuloma and air trapping[4](#core-r004). At this point in the discussion a tenable argument can be made for the diagnosis of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, but other information in the clinical evaluation has to be considered.Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a predominance of granulocytes with a few eosinophils. Although valuable data can be gleaned from this procedure, very few clinicians have been using it in the diagnosis and management of the care of patients with interstitial lung disease[5](#core-r005). However, it has been shown that clinicians have changed their diagnostic thinking in 59 percent of the cases on the basis of analysis of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid, and these changes are frequently important[6](#core-r006). Bronchoalveolar lavage permits the division of diffuse interstitial lung disease into lymphocytic and granulocytic alveolitis. Lymphocytic alveolitis can be caused by sarcoidosis, exogenous allergens, and granulomatous pneumonias due to infectious agents. Immunocytochemical determination of surface markers in conjunction with bronchoalveolar lavage can separate the harvested lymphocytes into various subtypes. A predominance of T suppressor lymphocytes indicates a hypersensitivity pneumonitis, whereas an excess of T helper cells correlates with sarcoidosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage has also become promising in diagnosing pneumoconioses and other lung diseases caused by inhalation of industrial pollutants. Harvested cells can be analyzed ultrastructurally with use of x-ray diffraction analysis or electron-spectroscopic imaging to identify various inhaled particulates. Electron-microscopical examination can also demonstrate dendritic cells in the washings in cases of pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma[7](#core-r007). The bronchoalveolar lavage in this case excluded diseases associated with a predominance of lymphocytes in the differential count.In many cases routine x-ray films of the chest cannot distinguish between interstitial disease and air-space disease because of the nonspecific patterns observed. There is also a limitation in separating reticular, nodular, and mixed reticulonodular patterns[8](#core-r008). However, the distribution of infiltrative lung disease frequently aids in making a correct diagnosis. Upper-lobe involvement suggests eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic granuloma, silicosis, coal-worker's pneumoconiosis, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and histoplasmosis[9](#core-r009). Asbestosis, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis often have a basilar distribution. Since plain radiographs are limited in their ability to differentiate the various morphologic patterns and distributions, CT scans have been advocated for defining patterns of diffuse lung disease. The early CT scanner contributed little to this distinction because of its slow scan times, motion artifacts, and poor resolution. With the advent of modern techniques, including high-resolution thin-section CT scanning, evaluation of diffuse lung disease has become precise, with a high correlation with pathologic changes[10](#core-r010). High-resolution CT scanning is also excellent for imaging the airways, including identification of bronchial-wall thickness and dilatation; it has made bronchographic examination almost obsolete. As a result, many patients with previously undiagnosed bronchiectasis can be identified and treated appropriately. High-resolution CT imaging can evaluate almost microscopic anatomical structures such as the secondary pulmonary lobule, a unit supplied by three to four terminal bronchioles and separated from other lobules by fibrous septa. Small pulmonary veins and lymphatic channels lie within these septa. The center of the lobule contains bronchioles, arteries, and connective tissue[11](#core-r011). The pattern and distribution of various changes in the secondary lobule may be used diagnostically. These changes include alterations in attenuation and the peripheral, axial, and parenchymal distribution of abnormalities[12](#core-r012).A jigsaw technique has been used recently to obtain precise topographic correlations between high-resolution CT scanning and histologic findings. In this manner diseases such as P. carinii pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and alveolitis have been identified[13](#core-r013). Often, the various causes of pulmonary cysts, including bronchiectasis, emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with honeycombing, eosinophilic granuloma, and lymphangioleiomyomatosis, cannot be differentiated[14](#core-r014). Changes due to eosinophilic granuloma can be confused with the hyperinflation and bullae seen in emphysema on ordinary radiographs of the chest. High-resolution CT scans, in contrast, can differentiate the almost imperceptible walls of centrilobular emphysema from the thin-walled cysts seen in eosinophilic granuloma. Occasionally, the only abnormalities seen in patients with eosinophilic granuloma are the cysts noted on high-resolution CT scanning[15](#core-r015). In addition to the exclusive occurrence of lymphangioleiomyomatosis in female patients or patients with tuberous sclerosis, the cysts seen on CT scans are usually uniform, round, thin-walled, and evenly distributed throughout the upper, middle, and lower lung zones[16](#core-r016).The radiographic appearance in this case is not compatible with lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The presence of thick-walled cysts, the bizarre shapes of the nodules, and the upper-zone distribution strongly suggest eosinophilic granuloma. The variably shaped nodules in eosinophilic granuloma, however, can be confused with those of metastatic tumors. In silicosis and coal-worker's pneumoconiosis the nodules are well-defined and centrilobular on high-resolution imaging[17](#core-r017). A thorough history and other physical findings can distinguish these disorders from eosinophilic granuloma. In cases of neoplastic disease the transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage are invaluable diagnostic tools. If the cavitary nodules in this case were neoplastic, these two procedures should have been positive. When all the radiographic findings are considered, I believe that the most probable diagnosis in this case is eosinophilic granuloma of the lung.The typical radiographic signs of eosinophilic granuloma of the lung include ill-defined or stellate nodules 2 to 10 mm in diameter, reticular or reticulonodular opacities, cysts, and honeycombing, especially in the upper lobes, with characteristic sparing of the costophrenic angles[17](#core-r017). Atypical radiologic features in eosinophilic granuloma include pleural effusions and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy[18](#core-r018); lymphadenopathy was observed in the case under discussion. When CT scanning shows the combination of thin-walled cysts with nodules in the upper-lung and mid-lung zones, the diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma is most probable[19](#core-r019).A transbronchial biopsy revealed focal fibrosis and intraalveolar fibrin. This technique has become routine for obtaining lung tissue in cases of pulmonary fibrosis. Twice as many pulmonary physicians prefer this method to open-lung biopsy[5](#core-r005). A case of pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma diagnosed by transbronchial biopsy was reported recently[20](#core-r020). Four of six specimens contained granulomas in which there were large histiocytes and inflammatory cells with eosinophilic infiltration. The granulomatous lesions had positive staining for S-100 protein. The histiocytes in eosinophilic granuloma have positive staining for S-100 protein but negative staining for lysozyme. Other diseases, such as reactive eosinophilic pleuritis, can be differentiated from eosinophilic granuloma by staining for lysozyme and a failure to stain for S-100 protein[21](#core-r021).Pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma usually presents between the third and fifth decades of life, with a slight male predominance. Fever, weight loss, and fatigue occur in up to 30 percent of the cases. In about 15 percent the presenting feature is a spontaneous pneumothorax. Ninety percent of the patients are active smokers[17,18,22](#core-r017).Cigarette smoking is associated with hyperplasia of the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and an increase in bombesin-like polypeptides in the lower respiratory tract, which may contribute to pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis since bombesin is a chemoattractant for monocytes and a mitogen for 3T3 fibroblasts. In a recent study the number of neuroendocrine cells with bombesin-like immunoreactivity in open-lung-biopsy specimens from patients with eosinophilic granuloma was 10 times the number in specimens from nonsmokers and those from patients with pulmonary fibrosis[23](#core-r023). In another study a high prevalence of pulmonary and extrapulmonary neoplasia was found in patients with pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma. Nearly half the tumors were malignant, including lung carcinoma, pulmonary carcinoid tumor, lymphoma, and extrapulmonary cancers. The mean age of the patients with tumors was 48.9 years, as compared with 34.5 years among the patients with eosinophilic granuloma without a tumor. That study suggests an association between eosinophilic granuloma and neoplasms. The almost invariable use of cigarettes by patients with eosinophilic granuloma is also an important risk factor for cancer[24](#core-r024). These findings suggest that eosinophilic granuloma or other similar processes may act synergistically with smoking to cause obstructive airways disease, pulmonary fibrosis, or cancer. Since the disease is known to undergo spontaneous remission, its undetected coexistence with smoking may have a role in the development of cancer or emphysema. Of course, that is only speculation.Eosinophilic granuloma of the lungs is a challenging diagnostic problem in which the CT scan is an invaluable tool. In addition, further delineation of the natural history of this process and its association with tobacco use may give us a better understanding of the pathogenesis of a variety of lung disorders, including carcinoma.My diagnosis in this case is eosinophilic granuloma of the lung.Dr. Eugene J. Mark: Dr. Joseph, will you tell us your thoughts before the diagnostic procedure?Dr. Patricia Maxwell Joseph: When the patient was seen initially by the Pulmonary Consultation Service, the main considerations were tuberculosis, in view of her history, and sarcoidosis. When I saw her more information was available.Her minimal symptoms and almost negative physical examination, along with the upper-lobe predominance and the CT-scan findings, suggested strongly the diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Volker Nickeleit: Microscopical examination of a wedge-resection specimen from the lingula revealed a nodular inflammatory-cell infiltrate distorting the normal lung architecture. The infiltrate was composed of large histiocytes with convoluted nuclei, eosinophils, neutrophils, plasma cells, and lymphocytes filling alveoli and infiltrating alveolar walls and creating focally a \u201cstellate\u201d appearance. The histiocytes had characteristic features of Langerhans' cells, with vesicular, eccentric, grooved nuclei, one or two indistinct nucleoli, and pink, slightly granular cytoplasm ([Figure 3](#f03)). Fibrosis was minimal, with mild associated emphysema.Histiocytosis X cells are the key feature in the diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhans'-cell granulomatosis or histiocytosis X)[25](#core-r025). These cells are considered identical to the Langerhans' cells found in the skin as well as normal lung[25\u201328](#core-r025). Langerhans' cells are bone marrow-derived, specialized antigen-presenting cells in the macrophage-monocyte cell system[26](#core-r026). Histiocytosis X cells and Langerhans' cells, unlike other histiocytes, can be stained immunohistochemically for S-100 protein ([Figure 4](#f04)) and OKT-6[28\u201330](#core-r028) but do not synthesize lysozyme[31](#core-r031). Ultrastructurally, tennis-racket-shaped granules -- Birbeck granules -- can be identified in the cytoplasm of both Langerhans' cells and histiocytosis X cells[27,28,31](#core-r027). OKT-6 immunoreactivity and Birbeck granules are not identified in interstitial dendritic cells or follicular dendritic cells in lymph nodes[27,28](#core-r027).Primary pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma is idiopathic. It is considered a localized nonmalignant histiocytosis, such as eosinophilic granuloma of bone[25,32](#core-r025). Many causes have been considered, ranging from hypersensitivity to viral infections, but no conclusive pathophysiologic mechanism has been elucidated so far[25,33,34](#core-r025). Pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma either resolves or evolves from a cellular to a fibrotic stage[25,35,36](#core-r025). In the rare cases of severe disease, examination of the lungs shows end-stage honeycombing, sometimes associated with pulmonary hypertension. Less than 5 percent of the patients die of respiratory failure[25](#core-r025).Dr. Mark: Dr. Harris, you followed this patient since the diagnosis was established.Dr. Steven E. Harris: In view of the variable natural history of the disease, the frequency of spontaneous remission, and her mild symptoms we decided initially to follow her clinically. She was well until six weeks after discharge, when she experienced gradually increasing dyspnea and a nonproductive cough. We started treatment with 60 mg of prednisone a day, which resulted in some resolution of her symptoms.I saw her four months later, when there was partial resolution of the radiologically demonstrated nodular densities. The follow-up pulmonary-function tests revealed increased first-second vital capacity (1.88 to 2.39 liters), forced vital capacity (1.88 to 2.77 liters), peak expiratory flow rate (4.82 to 6.53 liters per second), total lung capacity (3.45 to 3.8 liters), and the single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (10.9 to 13.2 ml per minute per mm Hg). The dose of prednisone had been tapered to 20 mg a day over the preceding two months. The patient's pulmonary function and clinical status have remained stable. It has been difficult to persuade her to stop smoking. We prescribed transdermal nicotine patches to assist her toward that goal.Dr. Mark: Langerhans' cells increase in the lung in a variety of conditions. They include usual interstitial pneumonitis, desquamative interstitial pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, and bronchogenic carcinomas. The most frequently mentioned function of Langerhans' cells is presentation of antigen to T lymphocytes, and one assumes that the Langerhans' cells operate immunologically in all these diseases[37](#core-r037).Dr. Levine: I have been following three patients with pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma, one of them for nearly 20 years. All three have continued smoking. Their radiographically evident pulmonary changes, which had consisted of multiple cysts and nodules, as described in this patient, have regressed, but severe obstructive airways disease has remained.Dr. Nickeleit: Proliferations of Langerhans' cells are not found exclusively in eosinophilic granuloma but are also seen commonly in cases of interstitial pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, and bronchogenic carcinoma. In these conditions, however, Langerhans' cells are scattered and do not occur in large aggregates[38](#core-r038).The number of Langerhans' cells increases in \u201chealthy\u201d smokers,[39](#core-r039) but a clear relation between cigarette smoking and the proliferation of Langerhans' cells leading to eosinophilic granuloma has not been established. This lack of a cause-and-effect relation is supported most convincingly by the absence of eosinophilic granuloma in millions of cigarette smokers.Dr. Mark: The cysts in pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma are not the result of necrosis with cavitation but probably arise as the walls of bronchioles are infiltrated and weakened by Langerhans' cells, causing the bronchioles to become ectatic. It is understandable why such cysts may regress.\n",

X-ray films of the mastoid region showed an osteolytic lesion on the left side. Six days before entry a left mastoidectomy was performed elsewhere for removal of a suspected cholesteatoma. The operation revealed a soft-tissue mass that eroded the posterior wall of the external auditory canal and the lateral mastoid cortex; no cholesteatoma was found. The operative procedure was terminated without the performance of a biopsy, and the patient was referred to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.\nThere was a past history of a hysterectomy for benign disease 15 years before admission, a left modified radical mastectomy for carcinoma 14 years before entry, and a cholecystectomy 5 years later. Five years before admission chest pain occurred, and isosorbide dinitrate, digoxin, and nitroglycerin were prescribed; the patient was subsequently free of chest pain. During the four years preceding entry she was followed by an otolaryngologist because of recurrent bilateral external otitis. Three years before admission a left facial palsy developed and cleared spontaneously after a few weeks. She was seen subsequently by an otolaryngologist because of bilateral external otitis. She wore a hearing aid in both ears for many years. The patient did not use tobacco or alcohol. She denied myocardial infarction, dyspnea, peripheral edema, palpitations, or dizziness.\nThe temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, the pulse was 70, and the respirations were 12. The blood pressure was 135/70 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient was a thin woman who appeared well. There was a recent incision behind the left ear; the left tympanic membrane was retracted, and an apparent mass lay behind the superior portion of the drum. The right ear was normal except for mild external otitis; the nose and throat were normal. There was a complete left facial paralysis. No lymphadenopathy was found. The carotid upstrokes were normal, and the jugular venous pressure was less than 5 cm. The lungs were clear. The heart rate was regular; a Grade 3 systolic murmur was heard at the cardiac apex. Examination of the right breast and the left mastectomy site showed no abnormality, and the abdomen and extremities were normal. Neurologic examination was negative except for the facial palsy.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 40.7 percent; the white-cell count was 10,800, with 75 percent neutrophils, 5 percent band forms, 19 percent lymphocytes, and 1 percent monocytes. The platelet count was 199,000. The prothrombin time was 10.2 seconds, with a control of 11.2 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 28.6 seconds. The urea nitrogen was 5.4 mmol per liter (15 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 7.38 mmol per liter (133 mg per 100 ml), the uric acid 4.1 mmol per liter (6.9 mg per 100 ml), the bilirubin 5 \u03bcmol per liter (0.3 mg per 100 ml), the cholesterol 49.4 mmol per liter (191 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 11.1 mmol per liter (10.8 mg per 100 ml) (normal, 2.2 to 2.77 mmol [8.8 to 11.1 mg]), the phosphorus 1.2 mmol per liter (3.8 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 70 g (the albumin 38 g and the globulin 32 g) per liter (7.0 g [3.8 g and 3.2 g] per 100 ml). The digoxin was 0.8 ng per milliliter. The sodium was 143 mmol, the potassium 3.9 mmol, the chloride 102 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 31 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) was 50 U (normal, 7 to 39), the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 193 U (normal, 88 to 230), and the alkaline phosphatase 103 U per liter (normal, 41 to 133). An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 64, with minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. X-ray films of the chest revealed slight cardiac enlargement and prominence of the aorta; there was evidence of a left mastectomy, with metallic clips in the left thoracic wall; the lungs, pleural spaces, and bony thorax appeared normal. X-ray films of the mastoid bones (\nFig. 1\n) disclosed erosion of the posterior portion of the left mastoid bone and an irregular destructive lesion in the adjacent squamosal portion of the left temporal bone; the destructive process also extended into the left occipital bone; a soft-tissue density lay within the left epitympanic recess and middle-ear cavity; the left temporomandibular joint and right mastoid bone were normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain and temporal bones (\nFig. 2\n), performed after the intravenous injection of contrast material, again showed the destructive lesion in the left mastoid, temporal, and occipital bones. It extended into the left jugular fossa and posterior fossa, with encroachment on the cerebellum, and through the mastoid bone into the subcutaneous tissue behind the external auditory canal, as well as through the dura into the left temporal lobe; the labyrinth and the left carotid canal were preserved; soft-tissue densities were observed in the bony external auditory canal, middle-ear cavity, and mastoid area. An electroneurographic study gave evidence of severe degeneration of the left facial nerve; the blink reflex was absent, and the compound action potential of the left perioral muscles was 3 percent of that on the right side. An audiographic examination revealed severe sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear and profound loss in the right ear.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. David M. Vernick\\*: In summary, this patient was in reasonably good health until nine days before admission, when a left facial paralysis developed suddenly. Of importance in the evaluation was the finding of a lytic lesion in the left mastoid bone. Before I discuss the diagnostic possibilities, I should like to review the radiologic studies.Dr. Alfred L. Weber: A film of the chest did not reveal any evidence of metastatic tumor. On the lateral projection of the mastoid bone on the left side (Sch\u00fcller's view) ([Fig. 1](#f001)) there is a soft-tissue density caused by a markedly enlarged earlobe. The film also shows a large, irregular lytic lesion of the mastoid bone, with no sclerotic reaction. The defect extends superiorly and posteriorly into the squamosal portion of the left temporal bone and into the left occipital bone. An axial CT section of the temporal bone with bone-window settings ([Fig. 2](#f002)) again reveals destruction, with fairly well defined margins in the posterior portion of the temporal bone, including the mastoid bone. There is a soft-tissue density in the epitympanic recess; the ossicles are displaced slightly posteriorly. The apex of the petrous pyramid is normal. An axial CT section with a soft-tissue window setting ([Fig. 2](#f002)) demonstrates slight enhancement of the tumor within the defect. The mass extends medially into the posterior fossa, encroaching upon the cerebellum. The fourth ventricle remains in the midline. On a slightly higher section the mass projects externally into the region of the ear canal and adjacent earlobe. A coronal cut demonstrates the mass, which projects from the mastoid bone into the occipital lobe and the left temporal lobe. The low-attenuation area around the tumor is a reflection of edema in the adjacent brain.In summary, the radiologic studies show a large lytic lesion with a tumor that extended to the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, the epitympanic recess, the bony external canal, and the adjacent skin. The mass also extended into the posterior fossa, with encroachment on the cerebellum and the left temporal lobe.Dr. Vernick: Dr. Weber, was the bone intact between the jugular bulb and the carotid canal?Dr. Weber: Yes.Dr. Vernick: Are any calcifications visible in the tumor?Dr. Weber: No calcifications are seen in the tumor.Dr. Vernick: We have the problem of an 82-year-old woman with an aggressive lytic lesion in her left mastoid bone that spread laterally to the parotid glandand medially to the brain. She had had a sudden onset of facial paralysis, without hearing loss or vertigo. To get an idea of the cause of this patient's illness it is important to review the lytic lesions that start in the middle ear and mastoid bone as well as those that extend to these structures from adjacent sites, such as the parotid gland or the posterior fossa, and those that metastasize from distant sites.[1\u20133](#core-r001)Of the benign tumors the cholesteatoma is the one that most commonly involves the middle ear and the mastoid bone.[4](#core-r004) This lesion is a skin-lined cyst that expands by trapping epithelial debris. It can cause bony erosion and, although uncommonly, can result in a facial paralysis. It can be silent for many years and present with an acute illness, usually otorrhea or hearing loss. The diagnosis of a cholesteatoma was excluded, though, by the first surgeon's evaluation.Meningioma is the second most common neoplasm in the posterior fossa[5](#core-r005) and has also been reported to occur as a primary tumor in the middle ear and mastoid bone.[5\u20139](#core-r005) It can enlarge to several centimeters before becoming symptomatic and can cause facial paralysis.[5,10](#core-r005) Unlike the appearance shown on the radiologic studies in this case, however, meningiomas have smooth bony margins and occasionally contain internal calcifications. The brain edema surrounding the tumor seen in this case would also be unusual for a meningioma.Paragangliomas, also known as non-chromaffin paragangliomas and glomus tumors, can become very large before causing symptoms.[3,10\u201312](#core-r003) Glomus jugulare tumors can extend posteriorly from the jugular foramen into the mastoid bone, middle ear, and posterior fossa, as seen in this case. They can cause facial paralysis and hearing loss as well as other cranial-nerve palsies,[13](#core-r013) but they usually are associated with pulsatile tinnitus or an audible neck bruit when they attain the size of this patient's tumor. Neither finding was reported in this case. The mass as described was superior in the mesotympanum rather than in an inferior location, the more typical site for an early glomus jugulare tumor. The tumor also did not enhance substantially with contrast material, the jugulocarotid spine was intact, and the bony erosion was irregular in contrast to the usual smooth tumor margins of glomus tumors.A review of other benign lesions of the temporal bone is not particularly helpful. An acoustic neurilemoma, the most common posterior-fossa tumor, is improbable in this case because of the aggressive nature of the lesion.[14,15](#core-r014) Hearing loss is usually the initial presenting symptom, and this patient's hearing was stable. A facial-nerve palsy is unusual even with larger neurilemomas, and the margins of bony erosion are generally smooth.Adenomas are rare but can occur in the ear.[16](#core-r016) When they do, they usually arise in the external canal. Osteomas and osteoblastomas are readily distinguished radiographically. This woman was too elderly for consideration of histiocytosis X[17](#core-r017) or a melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy. The tumor was too aggressive for the diagnosis of a chondroblastoma as well.[18\u201320](#core-r018)What about malignant tumors?[21\u201328](#core-r021) Squamous-cell carcinoma is the most common form of cancer of the ear, accounting for about 75 percent of the cases.[26,27,29\u201331](#core-r026) Sixty percent of the patients with these tumors have a history of chronic otitis media with recurrent or persistent drainage.[25](#core-r025) Squamous-cell carcinomas can be very aggressive, with considerable local destruction[3,32](#core-r003) and even intracranial invasion.[10](#core-r010) They generally present with severe ear pain, otorrhea, and hearing loss. Facial paralysis occurs in about 35 percent of the cases.[10](#core-r010) The patient under discussion did not have a protracted history of otorrhea. The four-year history of recurrent external otitis is not unusual for patients who wear high-gain hearing aids. In view of the severity of this patient's hearing loss an occlusive ear mold was almost certainly required to prevent feedback, setting the stage for recurrent external-canal problems. These problems, however, are benign and respond rapidly to medication and short periods of rest from the hearing aid. This patient had no otalgia or otorrhea, and although she did have a substantial hearing loss it was not reported to have changed with the recent illness. There were no visible lesions on the auricle or in the external canal, the two most common sites of origin of squamous-cell carcinoma. Her course just does not fit with this lesion.Basal-cell carcinoma is the second most common malignant tumor of the temporal bone.[33](#core-r033) It can have the same manifestations as squamous-cell carcinoma, including otalgia, otorrhea, hearing loss, and facial-nerve paralysis. In contrast to its usual indolent course, basal-cell carcinoma within 1 cm of the external auditory canal can be very aggressive, invading the temporal bone and spreading intracranially.[10](#core-r010) This patient had no evidence of a basal-cell carcinoma on the auricle or in the external canal.Lymphoma and leukemia can involve the temporal bone.[34\u201337](#core-r034) Perineural infiltration can lead to facial-nerve palsy. Middle-ear infiltration or eustachiantube infiltration can result in a conductive hearing loss.[38,39](#core-r038) Both diagnoses are unlikely in this case, given the patient's age, the normal hematologic picture, and the radiographic findings.[3](#core-r003)Sarcomas are only a tenth as common as carcinomas in the ear. They usually present with the same symptoms as carcinomas \u2014 otorrhea, hearing loss, facial paralysis, and periauricular fullness.[40](#core-r040) Rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and osteogenic sarcoma involving the temporal bone have all been described in the literature.[40\u201343](#core-r040) Most of these tumors present in a younger age group, however, and therefore a sarcoma is not likely in this case.[40](#core-r040)Melanomas can occur as primary or metastatic tumors of the ear.[44,45](#core-r044) Primary melanomas usually present as pigmented lesions on the auricle or with pain or bleeding, or both. There is a report of one case in which an isolated facial paralysis was the initial manifestation.[44](#core-r044) Distant metastases are common, occurring in up to 45 percent of the cases. This patient had no visible pigmented lesion, otalgia, otorrhea, or evidence of distant metastases.Less common still are the adenoid cystic carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and mucoepidermoid carcinomas that originate in the temporal bone.[46,47](#core-r046) The most common of these tumors is adenoid cystic carcinoma. Salivary-gland tissue can be found in the external auditory canal and occasionally in the middle ear, and the adenoid cystic carcinoma can be present in either place. A history of chronic otitis media with otalgia and facial paralysis is common. The tumor tends to spread along the nerve rather than cause extensive bony destruction. More common than its origin in the temporal bone, however, is its spread from the adjacent parotid gland. Without otalgia, a lesion of the external ear canal, or a parotid mass this diagnosis seems improbable. The other two tumors, adenocarcinoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma, also usually start in the external auditory canal and thus are unlikely diagnoses. Adenocarcinomas can be low-grade with no bony destruction or high-grade with extensive bony destruction, as seen in this case.[47](#core-r047) High-grade tumors have increased vascularity demonstrable on angiographic examination and may appear very similar to glomus tumors. The location of the tumor and the findings on examination of the external ear canal make an adenocarcinoma an unlikely diagnosis in this case.I shall turn now to tumors metastatic to the mastoid bone.[2,28,48,49](#core-r002) They can be divided into those involving it by direct spread and those that spread to it from distant regions.The skin, the parotid gland, the temporomandibular joint, the base of the skull, and the meninges can be sites of origin of tumor that spreads into the temporal bone along routes of least resistance \u2014 i.e., the carotid canal, the eustachian tube, and the internal auditory canal.[50](#core-r050) This patient had no skin lesions and no lesions of the parotid gland, temporomandibular joint, or base of the skull. The small area of possible parotid-gland involvement may have been an artifact from the surgical procedure or, more likely, reflected spread of the temporal-bone tumor to the parotid gland rather than a site of origin of the tumor.An intracranial origin of the tumor is also improbable. I have already dismissed the diagnosis of a meningioma.[51](#core-r051) Papillary tumors of the choroid plexus have been reported to invade the temporal bone, and some have had a very malignant course.[52\u201354](#core-r052) They usually are seen in younger patients, however, and typically have smooth eroded bony margins. Malignant intracranial tumors rarely invade the temporal bone.[2](#core-r002) Although neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma have been reported to spread to it, the primary center of focus of the tumor in this patient was the temporal bone, with no evidence of a separate intracranial lesion. Meningeal carcinomatosis is unlikely as well. With meningeal carcinomatosis tumor spreads up the internal auditory canal to cause sudden loss of inner-ear function. Sudden, profound hearing loss, often bilateral, and severe vertigo are common presenting manifestations. This patient had no evidence of any change in inner-ear function.Metastatic tumors to the temporal bone have been described, with the primary tumors in the breast, kidney, lung, thyroid gland, and gut, as well as many other sites.[2,28,55\u201362](#core-r002) Although rarely reported in the world literature (73 cases by 1968 and 137 by 1988), they are probably more common than is generally recognized. Unless the patient has symptoms referable to the temporal bone, such as pain, facial paralysis, or hearing loss, a search of this area for lesions is rarely performed. The patients usually have other, more disabling metastases by the time the temporal bone is involved. Also, postmortem examinations rarely include processing of the temporal bones for histologic examination. It is only in cases in which a catastrophic event points to the temporal bone, such as the case under discussion, that most metastatic tumors are found. There are now approximately 150 case reports of metastatic tumors in the temporal bone. Metastatic carcinoma from the breast, the most common type, has been reported in only 20 to 30 cases. The petrous apex is the most frequent area of involvement, followed by the tegmen tympani and the mastoid region. The metastatic tumors are usually less well differentiated than the primary tumor, making identification of the origin of the tumor difficult at times. Eighty percent of metastatic tumors present with otalgia. facial-nerve paralysis is the initial manifestation in half the cases. Hearing loss can be either conductive or sensorineural, and otorrhea can be present but is generally of short duration. The lesions initially appear lytic on radiologic study. Osteoblastic changes can be seen later in some cases, such as metastatic carcinomas from the prostate gland and breast.The patient under discussion had benign findings on physical examination except for the ear findings. The results of laboratory testing were basically normal. The x-ray films of the chest were normal. She had no evidence of local recurrence of the breast cancer and in fact had no evidence of tumor at any site other than the left ear. This last bit of information, though, can be misleading. Metastatic breast cancer can remain silent for years before appearing at a distant site.[63](#core-r063) Intervals of up to 19 years have been reported between the initial diagnosis of breast cancer and the diagnosis of temporal-bone metastasis.[28](#core-r028) Isolated temporal-bone metastases have been reported with no evidence of recurrence of the primary tumor. Also, adenocarcinoma metastatic from the breast can be very aggressive and less well differentiated than the tumor at its primary site.Confirmation of the diagnosis of metastatic tumor rests on a biopsy, and that is what I would have done next. I believe that a biopsy in this case showed adenocarcinoma, metastatic from the breast, 14 years after the primary tumor had been excised.A Physician: Will you comment about the occurrence of facial paralysis three years earlier and its resolution over a period of several weeks?Dr. Vernick: Recurrent facial paralysis, which I did not discuss, may be associated with a higher frequency of malignant temporal-bone tumors. Whenever one encounters a case of recurrent facial paralysis one should evaluate the patient for a possible malignant tumor. Even so, most of the cases of recurrent facial paralysis fall into the category of recurrent idiopathic facial paralysis, or Bell's palsy, which can recur either on the same side or on the opposite side of the original palsy. We were told that this woman had a tumor of the temporal bone. Therefore, I believed that a discussion of the differential diagnosis of facial-nerve palsy was not relevant to this case. In view of the size of this patient's lesion I would speculate that the paralysis several years earlier was related to the tumor, but there is no way of proving that theory.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Nadol, will you tell us your thoughts as you were following this patient before the diagnostic procedure?Dr. Joseph B. Nadol, Jr.: We knew from the observations of the previous operating surgeon that there appeared to be a tumor within the mastoid bone that had eroded the lateral wall of the mastoid cortex. In addition, we consulted the members of the Neurosurgical Service because of the intracranial extension seen on the CT scan, and it was their opinion as well that the best next procedure was a biopsy of the mastoid bone. Therefore, a postauricular incision was made, and a mastoidotomy was done to retrieve tissue for the pathologist.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Max L. Goodman: The pathology laboratory received two tissue fragments, 0.8 by 0.6 by 0.3 cm and 1.0 by 0.4 by 0.3 cm. Histologic examination showed adenocarcinoma with a marked desmoplastic response ([Fig. 3](#f003) and [4](#f004)). Estrogen receptors were demonstrated immunohistochemically in sections prepared from paraffin-embedded tissue.Unfortunately, the slides of the mastectomy specimen were no longer available for comparison with those of the recent specimen. The pathological report of the breast operation described a partly solid, partly cystic tumor slightly over 2 cm in diameter; the microscopical diagnosis was infiltrating duct carcinoma with no evidence of metastasis in nine axillary lymph nodes. In view of the microscopical features of the recent specimen, the absence of evidence of a primary carcinoma elsewhere, and the known appearance of late metastasis in some cases of breast cancer we are confident that the tumor in the mastoid bone was metastatic carcinoma from the breast.Several groups have investigated long-term survival in patients with breast cancer. Fentiman et al.[64](#core-r064) analyzed 51 cases in which the patients survived 20 years and 176 cases in which they died within a 20-year period. Of the 51 survivors 35 percent had documented lymph-node metastasis, in contrast to 49 percent of those who died. The size of the tumor was \"small\" in 21 percent of the survivors, in contrast to only 6 percent of those who died. The authors concluded that after five years these variables were of little prognostic importance. Valagussa et al.[65](#core-r065) studied the relapse rate of 716 patients after radical mastectomy. They found a 10-year relapse rate of 52.9 percent for the entire group; in patients with a negative examination of lymph nodes the relapse rate was 27.9 percent, whereas in those with lymph-node metastasis it was 75.3 percent. Langlands et al.[66](#core-r066) observed that women with breast cancer died 20 times as frequently as women in the general population within a given follow-up period. Patients who were free of cancer for 15 years had an excess mortality rate of 28 percent. Hibberd et al.[67](#core-r067) investigated the survival of 2019 patients with breast cancer up to 30 years after treatment. They concluded that the excess mortality rate fell rapidly after 10 years of survival and that the mortality rate approached normal after 20 years.Dr. Scully: Dr. Nadol, do you have a follow-up report on the patient?Dr. Nadol: The patient was evaluated by consultants from both Medical Oncology and Radiation Medicine, and on the basis of the pathological findings and the absence of other findings they were confident about the breast origin of this tumor and believed further that radiotherapy was indicated. The patient is now in the process of receiving palliative radiotherapy to this metastatic lesion.In general, in cases of carcinoma of the temporal bone in which a complete resection is impossible it is worth considering a tympanomastoid obliteration in preparation for full-course radiotherapy to decrease the frequency of osteoradionecrosis of the temporal bone. However, in this patient the left ear was the only hearing ear, there was no lesion of the external canal, and the tympanic membrane was normal. Therefore, it was thought that it was appropriate to irradiate directly.Dr. Scully: Is there still no evidence of tumor anywhere but in this area?Dr. Nadol: That is correct. Consideration was given to the performance of a small-bowel series and other diagnostic maneuvers, but on the basis of the physical examination and the pathological findings that was believed unnecessary. The only additional procedure that was done was a lateral tarsorrhaphy to protect the cornea of the eye.A Physician: Was a fine-needle aspiration biopsy considered as an alternative diagnostic procedure?Dr. Nadol: It was not. The patient had had an incision seven days earlier, and a needle biopsy was not considered advisable because the lateral mastoid cortex appeared to be intact. I thought that it would be impossible to place the needle through intact bone. Placing it through the drum would have been possible but might have damaged other structures, such as the inner ear, facial nerve, or dura. I concluded that a mastoidotomy was the simplest, most direct approach. The tumor proved to be within millimeters of the skin, however, and did not require drilling. In retrospect, therefore, a needle biopsy would have been possible.\n\nAddendum\n--------\n\nDr. Nadol: When seen 3 1/2 months after the diagnostic procedure radiotherapy had been completed, and the patient was asymptomatic except for persistent left facial paralysis. Hearing in the left ear was stable, and she had been placed on tamoxifen citrate by the oncologist.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Diane R. Pearl\n(Medicine): An 86-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient clinic of the cancer center at this hospital because of fatigue, night sweats, leukocytosis, and splenomegaly.\nThe patient had a history of hypothyroidism and Lyme disease but was otherwise well until approximately 3 months before presentation, when progressive fatigue developed while she was traveling during the summer. Two months before presentation, she was seen by her physician at another hospital. On examination, the blood pressure was 170/80 mm Hg; the remainder of the examination was normal. The thyrotropin level was 7.9 \u03bcU per milliliter (reference range, 0.34 to 4.82); testing for Lyme disease was negative, and the creatine kinase level was normal. The patient\u2019s dose of levothyroxine was increased from 50 \u03bcg to 75 \u03bcg daily. One week later, generalized unsteadiness developed. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the use of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or infarct and was unchanged from imaging studies obtained 1 year earlier. Approximately 1 month before the current evaluation, fatigue markedly worsened, and diffuse muscle aches developed, which were associated with pain that radiated down both legs. Nine days before this evaluation, the patient went to the emergency department at the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 150/69 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiration rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while she was breathing ambient air. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, total protein, and albumin; results of renal function tests were also normal. Other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Blood cultures were obtained, and doxycycline was administered. The patient was advised that her symptoms were not consistent with Lyme disease and was instructed to see her primary care physician for further evaluation.\nFour days later, on examination at her physician\u2019s office, the patient reported recent night sweats that were so drenching that she had had to change her nightgown. On examination, the blood pressure was 141/69 mm Hg, and the abdomen was soft and slightly distended; the remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin were normal; additional test results are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nDr. Naveen M. Kulkarni\n: The next day, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dependent atelectatic changes in both lungs (\nFigure 1\n), a low-attenuation lesion (measuring 15 mm in diameter) that was consistent with a hepatic cyst (with no biliary-duct dilatation), splenomegaly (maximal span, 15 cm [normal span, \u226413]), a renal cyst that appeared to be benign, atherosclerotic calcifications, and osteopenia. No evidence of metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis was seen.\nDr. Pearl\n: The patient was referred to the cancer center at this hospital.\nOn evaluation, she reported feeling tired and having intermittent muscle aches and night sweats. She reported no abnormal bleeding, bruising, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, change in appetite or sleeping pattern, weight loss, rash, pruritus, or known recent tick bite. She had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, glaucoma, a history of babesiosis, and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections; she also reported having had depression after the death of her husband. A diagnosis of Lyme disease had been made 14 months earlier, when she presented with erythema migrans and fatigue. Doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for a period of 2 weeks) was administered, and the rash resolved. Two months later, body aches and night sweats developed but resolved after a brief period; testing for antibodies to\nBorrelia burgdorferi\nand polymerase-chain-reaction assays for\nBabesia microti\nand\nAnaplasma phagocytophilum\nnucleic acids were negative; other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. She had had a hysterectomy for uterine prolapse, unilateral oophorectomy after an ectopic pregnancy, lumbar laminectomy, partial colectomy for diverticulosis, and bilateral total knee replacement. Daily medications and supplements included aspirin (81 mg), losartan, atorvastatin, calcium (40 mg), levothyroxine, celecoxib (200 mg), vitamin D, a multivitamin, cranberry tablets, and latanoprost ophthalmic solution, as well as lorazepam (0.5 mg, as needed) at night. She had no known allergies to medications. She lived alone in a coastal area of New England and had retired after working in education. She was physically active. She drank two alcoholic beverages each evening, had stopped smoking more than 50 years earlier after casual use, and did not use illicit drugs. Her father and sister had died of lung cancer, and her mother had died when she was older than 90 years of age. Her adult children were healthy.\nOn examination, the patient looked younger than her stated age. The temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 146/62 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiration rate 18 breaths per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.4. The tip of the spleen was felt 1 to 2 cm below the left costal margin, and there was trace edema in both ankles. There was no lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Results of tests of coagulation and renal function were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, phosphorus, and uric acid.

      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Amir T. Fathi*: All discussants were involved in the care of this patient, and the diagnosis is known to us. This 86-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism presented with progressive fatigue, drenching night sweats, and abdominal fullness. Laboratory testing revealed a predominantly neutrophilic leukocytosis, without associated cytopenias, and physical examination and imaging studies showed splenomegaly.Neutrophilia, or an elevated absolute neutrophil count, is common, and the differential diagnosis is broad. The normal white-cell count among adults is approximately 4000 to 11,000 per microliter, although this range varies according to demographic characteristics. Typically, most white cells (approximately 70%) are neutrophils. Leukocytosis is conventionally defined as a white-cell count greater than two standard deviations above the population mean, whereas neutrophilia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count two standard deviations above the population mean, or approximately 8000 per microliter.\n### Secondary Neutrophilia\n\nMost cases of neutrophilia are considered to be secondary cases. They can be triggered by bacterial, viral, or fungal infections or by systemic or localized inflammation related to rheumatologic, traumatic, or other noninfectious causes. Infectious causes of leukocytosis can produce a leukemoid reaction, with leukocytosis and circulating immature granulocytes. An increased absolute neutrophil count can also be seen in persons who smoke cigarettes and those with stress or anxiety; it may even be seen in some persons after they have engaged in strenuous physical activity. Leukocytosis and neutrophilia are frequently seen in patients who have undergone splenectomy or who are otherwise functionally asplenic. Certain medications can also lead to increases in peripheral neutrophil counts. Glucocorticoids are a common cause of neutrophilia, as are less commonly used agents such as all-*trans*-retinoic acid and other differentiating compounds (i.e., drugs that cause leukemic cells to differentiate into more mature cells) that are used in the treatment of acute leukemia. Paraneoplastic neutrophilia may occur in association with various hematologic and solid cancers; in some cases, neutrophilia may be related to an increased production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or other growth factors in the bone marrow compartment.[1](#core-r001)This patient did not have any signs of infection or inflammation. She was not a smoker, had not undergone splenectomy, and was not taking any medications that can lead to neutrophilia.\n### Primary Neutrophilia\n\n#### Benign, Congenital, and Familial Syndromes\n\nPrimary causes of neutrophilia encompass benign, congenital, and familial syndromes. These syndromes include chronic idiopathic neutrophilia, which is a benign condition characterized by the often-incidental detection of neutrophilia on laboratory evaluation; it may have no related symptoms and no effect on prognosis. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndromes, which are caused by defects in the adhesion of leukocytes to vessel walls as a result of a variety of inherited mutations, manifest clinically as neutrophilia and recurrent bacterial infections.[2](#core-r002) The cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the *NLRP3* gene encoding cryopyrin (a protein that is important in the innate immune response),[3](#core-r003) typically manifests as recurrent febrile episodes, leukocytosis, urticaria, conjunctivitis, and pain. The long-standing and recurrent features that can be seen in patients with these inherited conditions were absent in this case.[2,4](#core-r002) Some congenital syndromes, such as Down\u2019s syndrome (the trisomy 21 syndrome), are characterized by intermittent neutrophilia (which often occurs during times of stress), but these syndromes are clearly not included in the differential diagnosis in this case.[5](#core-r005)\n#### Clonal Bone Marrow Diseases with Neutrophilia\n\nAnother category of primary neutrophilias includes those associated with clonal bone marrow diseases \u2014 myeloproliferative neoplasms (chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia, and polycythemia vera) or neoplasms in which features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms overlap (e.g., chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML] and atypical CML).CML, which is defined by the presence of the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation and the resultant *BCR-ABL1* gene fusion, typically manifests as leukocytosis and neutrophilia \u2014 but with circulating immature granulocytes, which are not seen here. Essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera, which are often associated with the *JAK2* V617F mutation, are characterized by increased platelet and red-cell counts, respectively; although both these conditions can be seen in association with neutrophilia, this patient had neither thrombocytosis nor erythrocytosis. Primary myelofibrosis can also manifest as leukocytosis but is often associated with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Hypereosinophilic states may at times be characterized by elevated levels of neutrophils, but they are also marked by elevated eosinophil counts; some cases are associated with genetic alterations in the *PDGFRA, PDGFRB,* or *FGFR1* loci.Conditions in which myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features overlap include atypical CML and CMML. Atypical CML closely resembles chronic-phase CML, with leukocytosis and circulating immature forms (comprising at least 10% of peripheral cells), but with granulocytic dysplasia and absence of the *BCR-ABL1* rearrangement. CMML is characterized by both increased peripheral-blood monocytes and dysplastic features, which are often associated with anemia and thrombocytopenia. However, dysplastic features were not seen in this case.\n#### Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia\n\nChronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), which is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm, is characterized by leukocytosis (>25,000 circulating white cells per microliter), with a predominance of neutrophils, few (<10%) circulating immature granulocytes, and absence of the defining genetic alterations *BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB,* and *FGFR1*.\n#### Summary\n\nOur patient, a previously healthy 86-year-old woman, presented with a marked neutrophilic leukocytosis (a circulating white-cell count of >25,000 per microliter) that was associated with fatigue, failure to thrive, and splenomegaly. No associated cytopenias were present, nor was there an increase in the number of circulating immature forms or monocytes.On the basis of the patient\u2019s clinical presentation and initial diagnostic evaluation, our leading diagnosis was CNL. We performed a bone marrow biopsy and requested genetic testing in order to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nDiagnostic Testing\n------------------\n\n*Dr. Robert P. Hasserjian*: Review of the patient\u2019s peripheral-blood smear revealed leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils with normal granulation and nuclear lobulation; immature myeloid elements were rare, circulating blasts were not identified, and there was no increase in the monocyte count ([Figure 2A](#f02)). The bone marrow biopsy specimen was markedly hypercellular (80% cells, 20% fat) for the patient\u2019s age, with a predominance of myeloid elements; normal maturation was evident in both the biopsy specimen and aspirate smear ([Figure 2B and 2C](#f02)); no lymphoid aggregates were seen. There was no increase in marrow or blood eosinophil, basophil, lymphocyte, or blast counts. Megakaryocytes were normal in number and morphologic characteristics. On flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate, there was a small monoclonal B-cell population (1% of all marrow cells) that was CD19+CD20+CD5dim/\u2212CD10\u2212CD23dim+CD103\u2212. Bone marrow karyotyping showed a normal female karyotype with a clinically insignificant constitutional inv(9). Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed on bone marrow did not reveal a *PDGFRA* or *PDGFRB* rearrangement, and molecular genetic studies showed no *BCR-ABL1* rearrangement and no *JAK2* mutation.In this patient with unexplained neutrophilia, the finding of a markedly hypercellular marrow with a prominent granulocytic proliferation suggests a myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic\u2013myeloproliferative neoplasm.[6](#core-r006) This case meets the diagnostic criteria for CNL according to the 2008 and revised 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The diagnosis of CNL, a condition that was first recognized as a distinct entity in the 2001 WHO classification guidelines,[7](#core-r007) requires the presence of unexplained peripheral-blood leukocytosis (\u226525\u00d7109 white cells per liter), with neutrophils and bands comprising at least 80% of white cells, immature granulocytes comprising less than 10% of white cells, myeloblasts comprising less than 1% of white cells, an absolute monocyte count of less than 1\u00d7109 cells per liter, and absence of granulocytic dysplasia; a hypercellular bone marrow with increased granulocytic forms, less than 5% myeloblasts, and normal neutrophil maturation; splenomegaly; exclusion of *BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB,* and *FGFR1* genetic abnormalities; and exclusion of the diagnoses of polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, and essential thrombocythemia.In the past several years, it has been shown that up to 90% of patients with CNL harbor a *CSF3R* (colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor) mutation[8\u201310](#core-r008); the presence of this mutation has been added to the revised 2016 WHO list of diagnostic criteria for CNL.[6](#core-r006) To determine whether this patient had a *CSF3R* mutation, a sample of her peripheral blood was sent to Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston to undergo next-generation sequencing testing for gene mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms; testing was performed by means of the Rapid Heme Panel developed at the Dana\u2013Farber/Brigham and Women\u2019s Cancer Center in Boston. The testing revealed a missense mutation (c.1853G\u2192A, p.T618I) in the *CSF3R* gene, with a variant allele fraction of 27.8%. In addition, frameshift mutations in *TET2* (c.429delT, p.D143fs\\*; variant allele fraction, 39.8%) and *ASXL1* (c.1899\\_1900insA, p.H633fs\\*; variant allele fraction, 23.8%) were identified, as well as missense mutations in *SETBP1* (c.2602G\u2192A, p.D868N; variant allele fraction, 40.2%) and *TP53* (c.818C\u2192T, p.R273H; variant allele fraction, 5.7%).Our understanding of the spectrum of myeloid neoplasms has been enhanced by the association of particular gene mutations (or combinations of mutations) with disease phenotypes. The differential diagnosis of neutrophilia and the genetic associations with individual diagnoses are shown in [Table 2](#t02). This patient did have a mutation in *SETBP1,* which has been associated with atypical CML \u2014 a myelodysplastic\u2013myeloproliferative neoplasm that is associated with a worse prognosis than CNL. However, the *CSF3R* mutation appears to be relatively uncommon in atypical CML; moreover, granulocytic dysplasia, which is a criterion for a diagnosis of atypical CML, was absent in this case.[8,9,11\u201313](#core-r008) Mutations in *ASXL1* and *TET2* are relatively common in CMML, but this disease also has a very low incidence of *CSF3R* mutation and is typically characterized by peripheral-blood monocytosis, a finding that is also absent in this case.The significance of the *TP53* mutation, which occurred at a lower variant allele fraction than the other mutations, is uncertain. It may reflect the presence of a CNL subclone bearing an additional mutation, or it may be present in an unrelated clone; the *TP53* mutation can occur in lymphoid neoplasms, and a small clonal B-cell population was identified in this case by means of flow cytometry. However, the patient did not have peripheral-blood lymphocytosis on presentation, and there were no morphologic findings to suggest a concomitant B-cell lymphoma involving the bone marrow.*Dr. Timothy A. Graubert*: The diagnosis and classification of myeloid cancers relies increasingly on the demonstration of characteristic genetic abnormalities. Large-scale genomic profiling studies have provided new insight into the genetic basis for common myeloid cancers. For example, a study published in the *Journal* identified 260 genes that were recurrently mutated in 200 cases of de novo acute myeloid leukemia.[14](#core-r014) Increasingly, this information is being used to refine prognoses and identify patients who may benefit from new targeted therapies. The demand for clinical-grade assays with rapid turnaround of results for an increasing number of genetic lesions has spurred the development of targeted sequencing panels, such as the one that was used in this case.One important caveat that has emerged from recent exome sequencing studies involving large cohorts is that clonal populations of cells harboring somatic mutations in genes that are known drivers of myeloid leukemia can be detected in the peripheral blood of healthy persons. Researchers of two studies published in the *Journal*[16,17](#core-r016) detected this phenomenon, which has provisionally been called clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (also known as CHIP),[15](#core-r015) in more than 10% of persons older than 65 years of age. Taken together, these observations suggest that detection of a somatic mutation is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of a myeloid neoplasm. Careful integration of clinical, pathological, and molecular genetic findings is required to establish a diagnosis, as was done in the case under discussion.*Dr. Frank C. Kuo*: The Rapid Heme Panel used in this case is a 95-gene, amplicon-based, next-generation sequencing test performed at the Center for Advanced Molecular Diagnostics at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. The 95 genes recurrently mutated in hematologic neoplasms include genes of the spliceosome components, cohesin complex, RAS signaling pathway, regulators of DNA and histone methylation, and DNA repair, among others; many of these genes have known diagnostic and prognostic implications. For tumor suppressor genes, the entire coding regions are sequenced; for oncogenes, the known mutational hot spots are analyzed. The Rapid Heme Panel is designed to detect single-nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions (indels) as long as 55 base pairs, and copy-number variants. The sensitivity is 5% for single-nucleotide variants and indels and 30% for copy-number variants.Although bone marrow and peripheral-blood specimens are the most common specimen types that are tested, we have also successfully tested other body fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, and fresh-tissue biopsy specimens. The Rapid Heme Panel has been widely used to provide valuable diagnostic information for elucidating difficult cases, such as the one discussed here; monitoring disease progression before therapy is initiated and after it is discontinued; and identifying potential targets for therapy or determining a patient\u2019s eligibility for clinical trials. Since its launch 2 years ago, we have tested more than 5000 specimens, with an average turnaround time of 1 week and a failure rate of less than 1%.[18](#core-r018)\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Fathi*: CNL, which was first described approximately a century ago,[19](#core-r019) is rare, with only a few hundred cases reported in the literature.[20](#core-r020) The diagnosis is often made incidentally, but the constitutional symptoms seen in our patient, such as sweats, fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal symptoms related to splenomegaly, can be present.[21,22](#core-r021)The most effective therapeutic approach to CNL has not been well defined. Oral agents, including hydroxyurea and busulfan, have been used to control leukocytosis and splenomegaly and improve quality of life, and hydroxyurea was our initial choice for this patient.[23\u201326](#core-r023)In the past few years, new and targeted therapeutic options have become available for the treatment of certain myeloid neoplasms.[12,27\u201330](#core-r012) This patient had an activating mutation in *CSF3R,* the cell-surface receptor for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which has been described in patients with CNL.[8\u201310](#core-r008) G-CSF is thought to be important in regulating growth and differentiation of granulocytes. *CSF3R* mutations occur at two distinct regions: the membrane proximal region and the cytoplasmic tail, which can be truncated by nonsense and missense mutations. Mutations occurring at the former region, as were seen in our patient, result in dysregulation of JAK family kinases, whereas mutations occurring at the latter region result in dysregulation of SRC family\u2013TNK2 kinases. Membrane proximal mutations may confer sensitivity to JAK kinase inhibitors such as ruxolitinib, whereas truncation mutations may confer sensitivity to the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib but not to JAK kinase inhibitors.[8,9](#core-r008)*CSF3R* mutational status is being increasingly incorporated into diagnostic and management criteria.[31,32](#core-r031) As was the case in this patient, the genetic profile of CNL may include other abnormalities, such as *SETBP1, ASXL1,* and *TET2* mutations.[10,33](#core-r010) Whether these abnormalities affect the pathogenesis, evolution, or prognosis of CNL is currently not clear. One study suggested that concurrent *ASXL1* mutations, which were present in this case, may be prognostically detrimental.[33](#core-r033)After the detection of the JAK-activating *CSF3R* T618I mutation, ruxolitinib was added to the patient\u2019s medications, initially at a dose of 5 mg twice daily, with a gradual increase in the dose. The patient\u2019s night sweats and abdominal discomfort resolved over a 2-week period, although leukocytosis persisted. Hydroxyurea was discontinued, and she was treated with ruxolitinib at a dose of 20 mg twice daily. Unfortunately, 8 months after her initial diagnosis, the white-cell count began to rise, with a decreasing hematocrit level and platelet count. Ruxolitinib was discontinued and hydroxyurea resumed, and some abatement of the leukocytosis was noted.However, during this time, worsening lymphocytosis was noted, and additional studies were performed on the peripheral blood.*Dr. Hasserjian*: Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed numerous small-to-medium-size lymphoid cells with irregularly shaped nuclei and moderately abundant, pale cytoplasm. Flow cytometry showed 17% monoclonal B cells (CD19+CD20+ CD5dim/\u2212CD10\u2212CD23\u2212) with monotypic dim-to-moderate surface lambda immunoglobulin light-chain expression (absolute monoclonal B-cell count, 4940 per microliter). This immunophenotype is similar to that of the small monoclonal B-cell population in the previous bone marrow sample; in the context of the worsening lymphocytosis, it was consistent with progression to a small B-cell lymphoma or leukemia. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a der(6;17)(p10;q10), resulting in deletions of 6q and 17p, which are abnormalities that can be seen in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); FISH confirmed deletion of the *TP53* locus. No *IGH/CCND1* rearrangement was detected, which effectively ruled out mantle-cell lymphoma. Testing by means of the Rapid Heme Panel performed on cells sorted by CD19 expression showed that *TP53* mutations were present in the CD19+ cells, and the *CSF3R, SETBP1, TET2,* and *ASXL1* mutations were seen in the CD19\u2212 cells. These results confirmed that the *TP53* mutation was in the clonal B cells and not in the CNL cells.*Dr. Fathi*: Dr. Jeffrey Barnes of the lymphoma group at this hospital evaluated the patient and initiated treatment with ibrutinib for the concurrent *TP53*-mutated, CLL-like condition. Nevertheless, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly gradually worsened, and the patient died approximately 17 months after the initial diagnosis.*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): Are there questions for our discussants?*A Physician*: When evaluating neutrophilia, in addition to looking for *BCR-ABL1* rearrangement and the *JAK2* mutation, would it make sense to look for less common mutations such as the *CSF3R* mutation?*Dr. Fathi*: At the current time, I would not recommend doing this during the initial evaluation. However, when the cause of neutrophilia is not clear after the initial diagnostic evaluation, looking for those mutations would be appropriate.*Dr. Hasserjian*: I agree that this type of testing should be reserved for difficult differential diagnoses, although it is being increasingly performed up front in patients suspected of having a myeloid neoplasm. We don\u2019t know whether the *CSF3R* mutation could also occur in healthy older individuals, as is the case with other mutations associated with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential. One problem is that if you find a mutation, you may feel compelled to do something about it, which may not be appropriate if the condition does not meet the established criteria for a myeloid neoplasm. Detailed mutational testing should be used as an adjunct to standard pathological evaluation: analysis of blood and bone marrow morphologic characteristics, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetic analysis.*Dr. Bruce A. Chabner* (Oncology): What\u2019s the terminal phase of this disease?*Dr. Fathi*: CNL can progress to either marrow failure or acute leukemia. Splenic enlargement can lead to sequestration of blood elements, and there can be potentially life-threatening cytopenias.*A Physician*: Is the platelet count affected by ruxolitinib?*Dr. Fathi*: Yes, cytopenias are associated with ruxolitinib. This patient had no thrombocytopenia on presentation, and we therefore felt comfortable initiating ruxolitinib. However, thrombocytopenia developed and progressively worsened, which necessitated the discontinuation of ruxolitinib.\n",

      "question": "A twenty-four-year-old married woman entered the hospital because of morning hemoptysis.\nThe patient had been well until shortly after a pregnancy and delivery under ether anesthesia eight months before admission, when she developed a chronic cough, particularly in the morning, productive of a tablespoonful of whitish-yellow, nonfoul sputum. This persisted and in the three months before entry became associated with a dull, aching and occasionally sharp twinge of right subscapular pain on coughing. The patient denied chills, fever, night sweats and other constitutional symptoms, but noted progressive fatigability and a 15-pound weight loss despite a good appetite. The fingernails seemed to change during this period from normal configuration to a clubbed appearance. Three weeks before entry the patient had the onset of morning hemoptysis from a teaspoonful of bright-red blood to bloody streaking of the sputum. This was a daily occurrence but was unassociated with new symptoms or change in other symptoms. Five years before admission the patient developed a firm, nontender, and otherwise asymptomatic mass in the right anterior cervical region, which was removed in another hospital and allegedly found to contain a \"pocket of pus.\" About two years before admission she noted the gradual recurrence of a mass in the same region, with some increase in size up to the present.\nThe family and past histories were not remarkable. The patient denied known contact with tuberculosis.\nPhysical examination revealed a slender, well developed woman in no discomfort. There were several firm, nontender, freely movable, nodular masses in the right anterior cervical triangle \u2014 one measuring 2 by 3 cm., with adjacent 0.5-cm. nodules on the sternomastoid muscle, and one measuring 2 by 5 cm. in the supraclavicular fossa, which seemed to descend into the upper mediastinum. No other significant lymphadenopathy or abnormal masses were noted except for a slightly tender, freely movable mass, 2 by 5 cm., in the right breast and a similar mass, 2 by 3 cm., in the left breast. Early clubbing was noted in all fingernails. Examination of the chest revealed signs consistent with consolidation in the right upper lobe, most marked anteriorly. There were a Grade I short, blowing, basal systolic murmur and a split second sound at the base. The remainder of the physical examination was not remarkable.\nThe temperature was 98.6\u00b0F., the pulse 100, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 125 systolic, 70 diastolic.\nExamination of the blood disclosed a white-cell count of 14,000, with 92 per cent neutrophils. The hemoglobin was 11 gm. per 100 cc. Urinalysis revealed a + test for albumin and was otherwise negative. Sputum examination for acid-fast bacilli was negative. A skin tuberculin test was negative in dilutions of 1:100,000 and 1:10,000.\nX-ray study of the chest revealed increased density in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, with some degree of collapse and honeycombing in the lower portion of the lobe, interpreted as dilated bronchi. There was increased prominence of the right hilus, and some calcification was demonstrated in the right lung. The left lung was normal.\nThe findings were interpreted as \"drowned\" lung, secondary to obstruction in the right-main-stem bronchus.\nOn the fourth hospital day an operation was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. John G. Scannell: In second-year medical school we were asked in an examination to enumerate and discuss the causes of hemoptysis and were expected to rattle off with a fair degree of assurance the fourteen (or was it seventeen?) diseases concerned. I wish I could muster the same assurance today. However, assuming that the hemoptysis was bona fide, and in the present case there is every reason to believe that it was, we must look to the bronchial tree for either a primary lesion or changes secondary to pulmonary hypertension. With no evidence for the latter, I think we can safely dismiss it and confine our attention to diseases that give rise to localized changes in the lungs, to a definite lymphadenopathy and to generalized systemic changes \u2014 namely, weight loss, chronic fatigue and clubbing. As a point of departure, may we see the x-ray films?Dr. James C. McCort: The examination of the chest reveals an increase in density of the anterior and apical segments of the right upper lobe. These segments are reduced in size. Within the involved segments there are radiolucent areas giving the segments a honeycombed appearance. This may be due to dilated bronchi and bronchioles. None of these radiolucent areas show a fluid level. There is a slight amount of fluid in the overlying pleura and in the minor fissure on the right side. The right-upper-lobe bronchus can be traced for a distance of 1 cm. distal to its orifice, at which point it is narrowed and apparently blocked. There is no definite evidence of displacement of the trachea or mediastinum. Enlargement of the right peribronchial lymph nodes is present. There are also a few flecks of calcification in the peribronchial area, which may be within lymph nodes. The remaining lung fields are clear. The diaphragm is in its normal position. There is no blunting of either costophrenic sinus. The heart and vessels appear normal.Dr. Scannell: Are you impressed by the curving deviation of the trachea to the left? I assume that is compatible with the large lymph node in the right cervical triangle described in the physical examination.Dr. McCort: The cervical portion of the trachea does show a slight displacement to the left side, which may be due to the mass described in the right side of the neck. The exact amount of displacement is difficult to determine because there is slight scoliosis of the spine.Dr. Scannell: We have, therefore, evidence of a lesion that involved bronchi of the order of segmental bronchi, and hence presumably could be visualized and, perhaps, biopsied through a bronchoscope. There were also cervical lymph nodes that, according to the description given, were sufficiently abnormal to warrant biopsy. We are, however, called upon to make a diagnosis in advance of these diagnostic maneuvers.In a patient of another sex and another age group, the diagnosis would be carcinoma until proved otherwise. The marked male-sex preference of bronchiogenic carcinoma is well known (usually estimated to be about ten to one), and in a patient in the twenties the unlikelihood of carcinoma is greatly increased. Except for these facts, however, the history of an unfamiliar cough, dull, aching chest pain, weight loss, chronic fatigue and, especially, early pulmonary osteoarthropathy are all highly suggestive, and the finding of a segmental lesion by x-ray examination and enlarged cervical, paratracheal and mediastinal lymph nodes is almost confirmatory. To rule out cancer requires a positive diagnosis of something else, presumably benign tumor, a chronic suppurative process or tuberculosis.We might mention other rare tumors, notably chorionepithelioma and lymphoma. The former is, perhaps, suggested by the onset following pregnancy, but that is all that we have in its favor and I shall discard it. Lymphoma of the lung is rare, particularly with endobronchial involvement, but it is known to occur; it may invade the bronchial tree, and certainly is suggested here in view of the rather striking cervical-lymph-node involvement and the evidence of considerable hilar lymphadenopathy by x-ray examination. In addition, we have the evidence of a chronic disease without great blood loss. I am a little disturbed by the apparent lack of fever.In the case of lymphoma of the lung reported from this hospital by Dr. Churchill[1](#core-r001) in 1947, there were several points of similarity to the present case. The patient was a woman, she complained of a dull aching pain beneath the right scapula, and her physical signs were those of consolidation \u2014 that is, an open lobar bronchus with solidified lung adjacent to it. On the other hand, she had no lymph-node involvement, no clubbing, no hemoptysis and no anemia. She had had symptoms some six months or so, with episodes of fever. However, the case presented apparently a solitary lymphoma of the lung itself, and not, as we must postulate in the case under discussion, a lymphoma situated in the right bronchial node and invading and involving the right-upper-lobe bronchi secondarily. Certainly, the cervical lymph nodes suggest lymphoma in that they were freely movable, firm, nontender and of considerable size. Were they of tuberculous origin, I would expect them to be less discrete, more uniformly involved and possibly displaying some calcification on x-ray study. Furthermore, a definite diagnosis of tuberculosis was ruled out by negative sputums and negative tuberculin tests. An acid-fast node eroding into a bronchus is, in a way, an attractive diagnosis to make for this patient, but I do not see how we can support it.Of the possibilities outlined above, benign tumor was mentioned. The patient was a woman, she was young, she had had some bleeding, and she had segmental secondary changes. However, this diagnosis fails to account for the enlarged lymph nodes, except the very rare bronchial adenoma with extensive satellite-lymph-node involvement. In any case, were the latter involved secondary to a pulmonary lesion, I would expect greater involvement of the subcarinal node, and as we can see by the overexposed film of the chest, the carina is quite sharp and normal in appearance. Incidentally, were the lesion a highly undifferentiated bronchiogenic carcinoma of the oat-cell variety, I should expect the same distortion of the carina as is present in this case.Turning to a more hopeful diagnosis, in view of the onset of cough following an inhalation anesthesia, chronic lung abscess must be carefully considered. Chronic, somewhat productive cough, hemoptysis and clubbing are in its favor. Absence of fever, the presence of cervical lymph nodes and the location in the anterior and apical segments of the upper lobe as opposed to the posterior segment of that same lobe are against it. Both by history and on x-ray study there was no evidence of a sequestration of lung tissue. Furthermore, no penicillin or streptomycin had been given, which might obscure the natural history of the disease.Bronchiectasis limited to the right upper lobe is a possibility, but here again the history is relatively short and atypical, the x-ray picture, in spite of the suggestion of dilated bronchi, is not that of saccular, dry bronchiectasis in this area, and the cervical lymph nodes are not accounted for. Bronchiectasis secondary to a foreign body is always a possibility, especially in view of the previous anesthesia, but we have no evidence on which to base this diagnosis.A closely related lesion \u2014 namely, chronic nonspecific pneumonitis of the cholesterol type[2](#core-r002) \u2014 certainly merits our consideration. The history is not at all out of line, although one would expect more evidence of an active inflammatory process at some time in its development and less striking hemoptysis, and although marked regional lymphatic involvement is the rule (and is evident here on the chest film), again the presence of these definitely abnormal cervical lymph nodes is difficult to explain. Strangely enough, at no time was viral pneumonia diagnosed and antibiotics given.One always wonders, particularly in this hospital, about the diagnosis of sarcoid in puzzling lymphatic and pulmonary lesions, but if I understand Dr. Freiman[3](#core-r003) aright, even considerable enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes is rarely associated with pressure or obstructive phenomena, a point of differentiation from lymphoma or carcinoma.Metastatic carcinoma is also a definite possibility, and in this case would incriminate the thyroid gland or some silent primary focus. We have little evidence to single out the former, and no real evidence to indicate the latter \u2014 for example, a silent hypernephroma. At some risk, I am going to disregard the bilateral breast masses.Clearly, a most helpful next step in the diagnosis would be either a bronchoscopic biopsy or a cervical-lymph-node biopsy, and one of these, I suspect, was the operation performed on the fourth hospital day. When I embarked upon this discussion, I was inclined toward a nonspecific chronic pneumonitis with marked hilar involvement, believing that the history, the age and sex of the patient, the x-ray picture and the physical signs were consistent with this diagnosis, but as I reconsider it, I am more than ever impressed by the cervical lymphadenopathy and therefore elect lymphoma with bronchial encroachment and erosion as the probable diagnosis.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Benjamin Castleman: On the ward, the differential diagnosis rested mainly between tuberculosis and lymphoma. Dr. Joseph C. Aub, who was on service at that time, believed that \"the most reasonable single diagnosis is lymphoma occluding the bronchus.\"One of the cervical lymph nodes was removed, and it showed the characteristic microscopical findings of Hodgkin's disease. Dr. Benedict reported that bronchoscopy of the right bronchial tree was difficult because of the apparent pressure on it from the right side, but with the right-angle telescope, the orifice of the upper lobe was readily visible and found to be markedly stenotic. No outcropping could be seen.The patient was then given x-ray treatment over a period of eight days, 300r per day, the anterior and posterior right upper mediastinum each receiving 900r and the supraclavicular region 600r.The patient did not return to this hospital, but it was later learned that there was a good response to this treatment for about a year. She then entered another hospital very sick with fever, weight loss, anemia, pleural effusion and ascites. After tapping of the chest, a mass was observed within the right lung and after tapping of the abdomen, the liver and spleen were found to be enlarged. X-ray treatment was again given, but this time there was no improvement. However, a course of nitrogen mustard produced a miraculous change in the patient. The mass in the lung practically disappeared, and the patient was able to be herself again. This remission lasted for about three weeks, but she then returned with pain in the opposite chest. Nitrogen mustard again brought relief. She has just recently been discharged from the hospital after her third remission, which is about two years since admission to this hospital.\n",

      "question": "A 74-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of hypercalcemia and an osteolytic bone lesion.\nThe patient had been in good health until six years earlier, when hypercalcemia was discovered. The alkaline phosphatase was increased, and the parathyroid hormone was six times the upper limit of normal. The calcium rose as high as 13.6 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter), although the patient denied all symptoms. An ultrasonographic examination of the neck was said to show no definite evidence of a parathyroid adenoma.\nThereafter the patient continued to feel well except for intermittent fatigue until three months before admission, when pain of variable intensity developed about the right shoulder; it was managed with acetaminophen and did not interfere with her daily activities. Two weeks before entry the pain became considerably worse, and she consulted a physician. The calcium and alkaline phosphatase were again elevated. Radiographs of the right shoulder showed a destructive lesion of the proximal shaft of the right humerus. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nThe patient was a retired clerical worker. There was a history of lifelong pectus excavatum. An abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy had been performed 20 years earlier for benign disease, and hormonal replacement had been prescribed for 2 years. More recently, a dowager's hump developed, without known fracture. The patient took lisinopril for hypertension. There was no family history of peptic-ulcer disease, parathyroid disease, or other endocrinopathy. There was no history of increased thirst, urinary frequency, constipation, weight loss, urolithiasis, fracture, peptic-ulcer disease, use of vitamins or calcium supplements, Paget's disease, exposure to ionizing radiation or industrial toxins, or use of tobacco or alcohol.\nThe temperature was 37 \u00b0C, the pulse was 84, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 150/90 mm Hg.\nOn physical examination the patient appeared well. The head and neck were normal; no cervical masses were palpated. A dorsal kyphosis was present. The lungs, heart, breasts, and abdomen were normal. There was slight swelling with diffuse tenderness about the right shoulder that extended distally; the range of motion at the shoulder was limited in all directions, and the patient was unable to flex or abduct the right arm more than 35 degrees; grasp in the right hand was weak.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 37.6 percent; the white-cell count was 7000 per cubic millimeter, with a normal differential count; the platelet count, prothrombin time, and partial-thromboplastin time were normal. The calcium was 13 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 2.3 mg per deciliter (0.74 mmol per liter), and the cholesterol 256 mg per deciliter (6.62 mmol per liter); the alkaline phosphatase was 209 U per liter (normal, 30 to 100); the urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, bilirubin, uric acid, protein, albumin, globulin, serum aspartate aminotransferase, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were normal. The sodium was 139 mmol, the potassium 4.8 mmol, the chloride 108 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 24 mmol per liter. The carcinoembryonic antigen was less than 1 \u03bcg per liter, and serum immunoelectrophoresis was normal. The concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM were normal. The intact parathyroid hormone by immunoradiometric assay was 427 pg per milliliter (normal 10 to 60). Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a normal pattern; protein electrophoresis of the urine showed that albumin was present. A monoclonal screen of the serum disclosed a polyclonal increase in IgA. Radiographs of the right shoulder (\nFigure 1\n) showed chondrocalcinosis within the joint; there was an osteolytic and slightly expansile lesion in the proximal humeral shaft, with destruction of the overlying cortex. Mammographic examination was negative except for a lobular density, 1.5 cm, in the left breast that appeared benign. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the proximal right humerus (\nFigure 2\n) revealed a soft-tissue mass, approximately 5 cm long, within the diametaphyseal region of the right proximal humerus, with disruption and destruction of the cortex anterolaterally; the mass extended 1.5 cm beyond the cortical rim and lay beneath the deltoid muscle; fatty marrow was visible proximal and distal to the lesion; the appearance was believed to be nonspecific but characteristic of an aggressive lesion. A CT scan of the thorax disclosed kyphosis and linear scarring at both lung bases, with mild bronchiectasis at the left base; no evidence of a primary or metastatic malignant tumor or of mediastinal lymphadenopathy was detected. A bone survey showed diffuse osteopenia; no subperiosteal bone resorption was observed about the phalanges, and the joint spaces were normal in the hands; there was chondrocalcinosis with cartilage loss in the knee joints; the right humeral lesion was again noted. A radionuclide bone scan demonstrated increased uptake in the proximal right humerus and right wrist. An ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen was negative. Radiographs of both hands, the lower legs, and the skull disclosed chondrocalcinosis that involved the metacarpophalangeal joints and profound osteopenia and subperiosteal tunneling of bone; there was a suggestion of a \u201ccotton-wool appearance\u201d in the calvarium; no subperiosteal resorption of bone, resorption of the digital tufts, or cystic lesions were observed.\nSaline was administered by vein; lisinopril and acetaminophen were continued. On the second hospital day the urea nitrogen was 13 mg per deciliter (4.6 mmol per liter), the creatinine 0.6 mg per deciliter (53 \u03bcmol per liter), the calcium 11.6 mg per deciliter (2.9 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 2.1 mg per deciliter (0.68 mmol per liter), and the protein 5.9 g per deciliter (59 g per liter) (the albumin 3.4 g and the globulin 2.5 g per deciliter [34 g and 25 g per liter]). The sodium was 139 mmol, the potassium 4.9 mmol, the chloride 117 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 19 mmol per liter.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Michael M. Lewis[\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic findings?Dr. Felix S.-K. Chew: A radiograph of the right shoulder ([Figure 1](#f01)) shows diffuse osteopenia, with chondrocalcinosis involving the humeral articular cartilage. An asymmetric osteolytic lesion in the proximal humeral shaft had destroyed the overlying cortex. A CT scan ([Figure 2](#f02)) demonstrates a mass of soft-tissue attenuation centered in the cortex that had focally destroyed a portion of it and extended into the medulla and the soft tissues. A slice obtained toward the inferior margin of the lesion reveals a thin rim of bone confining it. The interfaces between the lesion and the normal fatty marrow and between the lesion and the overlying soft tissues are well circumscribed. A radiograph of the hand shows osteopenia, intracortical tunneling, and endosteal bone resorption in the phalanges. A lateral radiograph of the skull discloses mottling of the cranial vault. A radiograph of the knee shows chondrocalcinosis and osteopenia.Dr. Lewis: Six years before admission this woman was asymptomatic, with elevated serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels and a markedly elevated parathyroid hormone level. Although the diagnosis of a parathyroid adenoma was apparently entertained, it was either ruled out or put aside because of the negative ultrasonographic examination. However, the study did not exclude a small eutopic adenoma or an ectopic adenoma[1](#core-r001). Furthermore, it did not rule out parathyroid hyperplasia or an occult parathyroid carcinoma[2\u20135](#core-r002). The last is very uncommon but may be initially asymptomatic and impalpable. There is no description of osseous radiologic findings or mention of underlying renal failure at that time. All those studies were apparently conducted in an outpatient setting. Statistically, hypercalcemia in an ambulatory setting is more often due to parathyroid hyperfunction than to an occult malignant tumor.Three months before admission the patient began to have pain in the right shoulder girdle of variable intensity. The pain progressed but did not require substantial medication or interfere with normal activities. The recent admission was precipitated by an apparent pathologic fracture of the proximal right humerus, when the patient appeared well.The most important initial laboratory findings were the elevated serum calcium level and the markedly increased level of intact parathyroid hormone. The substantial elevation in the alkaline phosphatase level is consistent with its derivation from bone, in view of the normal results of hepatic-function tests. The most common causes of an elevated serum calcium level are hyperparathyroidism and malignant neoplasms; none of the other causes, such as dietary abnormalities including vitamin A or vitamin D intoxication, the milk-alkali syndrome, sarcoidosis, hyperthyroidism, Paget's disease, especially with a fracture or immobilization, generalized immobilization itself, adrenal insufficiency, the use of thiazide diuretics, lithium therapy, or idiopathic familial hypercalcemia, are serious considerations in this case.The initial diagnostic possibility is primary hyperparathyroidism, which is consistent with the hypercalcemia, the borderline-low serum phosphorus level, the markedly elevated level of intact parathyroid hormone, the increased alkaline phosphatase level, and the substantial increase in the chloride-phosphorus ratio, which was greater than 50. A ratio greater than 33 has been said to be more consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism than with hypercalcemia associated with a malignant tumor[6](#core-r006). Although this interpretation is controversial, it favors primary hyperparathyroidism over paraneoplastic hypercalcemia. The strikingly elevated level of intact parathyroid hormone and the indolent clinical course are also consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism. We have no measurement of the serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 level, which if increased would favor the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. The patient's history of intermittent fatigue and ultimate bone demineralization is also compatible with a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism.The general radiographic findings are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, even though some of the typical findings such as \u201csalt-and-pepper\u201d changes were not seen. The studies demonstrated substantial bone wasting with osteopenia, vertebral compression fractures, which could account for the thoracic kyphosis, periosteal tunneling, and a cotton-wool appearance of the skull. No cystic lesions were visible in the bones, but there was no opportunity to see the proximal humerus before the fracture occurred, when it might have contained a cystic lesion. The plain films also showed evidence of calcium pyrophosphate disease, which apparently was asymptomatic but can be associated with hyperparathyroidism[7](#core-r007). Chondrocalcinosis can be seen by itself in the elderly[4](#core-r004) and has been associated with chronic disorders such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, acromegaly, and Paget's disease[8](#core-r008). The patient did not present with other findings consistent with hyperparathyroidism, such as renal abnormalities, other radiographic evidence of hyperparathyroidism, including subperiosteal resorption and loss of the lamina dura, and gastrointestinal problems, but not every patient has all the clinical signs or symptoms or radiographic findings of hyperparathyroidism[9,10](#core-r009).The question is whether the mass in the proximal right humerus originated in the bone and extended into the soft tissue or vice versa, but the former appears more likely. It is important, however, that the CT scan showed no bone marrow involvement proximal or distal to the lesion, implying that it was not infiltrative or permeative.On radiographic grounds the humeral lesion appeared aggressive but not characteristic of any particular lesion. The radiographic differential diagnosis includes aggressive benign disease, such as a giant-cell tumor of bone or an aneurysmal bone cyst. Malignant-tumor considerations are myeloma, possibly with an amyloid component, lymphoma, primary and metastatic tumors, including vascularized tumors such as renal-cell and thyroid carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma. Nonetheless, a tumor-like process, such as a brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism or a giant-cell reparative granuloma, can mimic some of these lesions[11](#core-r011). Although a soft-tissue component is unlikely in a brown tumor, a fracture with bleeding can result in a soft-tissue mass. Furthermore, with reference to the clinical setting, if the hyperparathyroidism was due to a parathyroid carcinoma the humeral lesion could possibly represent a metastasis.The most likely diagnosis in this case is primary hyperparathyroidism, which is due to a solitary adenoma in 80 percent of the cases and multiple adenomas in 5 percent of the cases. Although this diagnosis was apparently excluded six years before admission, an adenoma may have been missed because of its small size or an ectopic location. If an adenoma was sizable in the usual location, it should have been detected six years ago, but apparently no imaging studies of the neck were done at that time. If an adenoma had been mediastinal it might have been detected on a CT scan.In approximately 15 percent of the cases primary hyperparathyroidism is attributed to parathyroid hyperplasia, which could be the diagnosis in this case. Unless a selective catheterization study of the parathyroid veins is performed, this diagnosis cannot be made before a surgical exploration, especially if the parathyroid glands are not diffusely enlarged. Parathyroid carcinoma is found in less than 1 to 5 percent of all cases of primary hyperparathyroidism. Although it is usually accompanied by very high serum calcium levels, it can have an indolent clinical course similar to that in this case. Therefore, this diagnosis should still be considered, especially if there is any link between the humeral lesion and an occult neoplasm, as opposed to general osteopenia and a brown tumor due to underlying benign primary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is not a major consideration in a patient with normal renal function and a markedly elevated level of intact parathyroid hormone, and the possibility of tertiary hyperparathyroidism is remote without an apparent cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism.Another important consideration in the initial differential diagnosis is an occult neoplasm, such as myeloma or a malignant tumor, with paraneoplastic hypercalcemia due to production of a parathyroid hormone-like polypeptide. When hypercalcemia was first associated with a malignant tumor, some observers speculated about the production of parathyroid hormone by the tumor[12\u201314](#core-r012). Now the hypercalcemia is believed to be due to some other factor or factors, and the designation of \u201chumoral hypercalcemia of malignancy\u201d has been used[15\u201319](#core-r015). Paraneoplastic hypercalcemia often occurs in the absence of active bone disease.A number of features of this case are against paraneoplastic hypercalcemia, particularly the elevation of the level of intact parathyroid hormone rather than elevation of nonparathyroid polypeptides. Furthermore, the course of at least six years eliminates all but the most indolent malignant neoplasms. The patient had no history of weight loss and appeared well, her only systemic symptoms were probably secondary to the increased calcium level alone, and the carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal. Other findings also point away from a paraneoplastic syndrome. There was no evidence of a primary or metastatic tumor on the CT scan of the chest and mediastinum, and the negative ultrasound study of the abdomen is against a renal tumor or a pheochromocytoma. The patient had only mild hypertension and a negative family history for polyendocrinopathy. The normal serum protein electrophoresis is against the diagnosis of myeloma, particularly with normal blood counts. The presence of myeloma without paraprotein production is unusual, and it is generally a very aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis. Some gynecologic carcinomas are associated with paraneoplastic hypercalcemia, but the patient had had a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 20 years before admission. Finally, an occult malignant tumor is possible as a second disease coexisting with primary hyperparathyroidism.Although amyloidosis is seen more commonly with myeloma, it can be associated with other chronic disorders or even isolated as a senile type. Perhaps amyloidosis had a role in the lesion of the humerus and also in the weakness of the right wrist, with an undiagnosed carpal-tunnel syndrome.In summary, I think that the principal finding was primary hyperparathyroidism, with a brown tumor of the humerus.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. White, you saw this patient before she came to this hospital. Will you tell us your impressions at that time?Dr. Charles F. White: When she came to the walk-in clinic with pain and immobility of her right shoulder, a calcium level of over 13 mg per deciliter, and a lytic bone lesion in the proximal right humerus, we thought that she probably had metastatic carcinoma or a primary bone tumor. When she was admitted to the hospital, a history of hypercalcemia for several years was obtained, and the possibility of hyperparathyroidism in addition to a primary or metastatic bone tumor became high on our list. During the six years before she came to our hospital she had been advised to undergo a neck exploration, but she declined.Dr. Scully: Dr. Mott, will you tell us the impressions of the Orthopaedic Service?Dr. Michael P. Mott: We thought that the patient probably had primary hyperparathyroidism with a brown tumor. However, we could not exclude other causes of the bony lesion and considered it important to obtain a tissue diagnosis.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. John X. O'Connell: The diagnostic procedure was a needle biopsy of the humeral mass. Microscopical examination revealed that it was composed of numerous osteoclasts with stromal hemorrhage ([Figure 3](#f03)). These histologic findings in the setting of documented hypercalcemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone levels, and a decreased serum phosphorus level are diagnostic of a brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid hormone affects predominantly the kidney and skeleton. It causes diminished renal calcium clearance, increased phosphate excretion, and activation of vitamin D in the kidney, and it results in osteoclastic activity and release of calcium in bone[20](#core-r020) by binding to plasma membrane receptors on osteoblasts, which subsequently activate osteoclasts[21](#core-r021).Primary hyperparathyroidism is relatively rare,[22](#core-r022) with an incidence of approximately 5 per 10,000 population per year, which is substantially increased over its reported frequency 60 years ago[23,24](#core-r023). The main reason for the apparent increase is the widespread use of automated mechanisms for measuring serum calcium levels, with the identification of many asymptomatic patients. Hyperparathyroidism usually affects adults in the fifth to seventh decades and occurs more commonly in females[24](#core-r024). It is due in most cases to a single parathyroid adenoma, less commonly to hyperplasia of all four glands, often in association with the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, and rarely to parathyroid carcinoma[25,26](#core-r025). The typical symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism are renal colic due to stones, diffuse skeletal and joint pains, and a variety of gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric disorders,[27,28](#core-r027) giving rise to the pithy \u201cstones, moans, bones, and abdominal groans\u201d characterization that is so easily remembered by medical students. The typical symptoms, however, are rarely encountered. A considerable number of patients, however, present with evidence of nephrocalcinosis, tubular absorption defects, and diminished renal function[24,29](#core-r024). Chondrocalcinosis and calcific periarthritis are also frequent manifestations,[30](#core-r030) and fractures secondary to diffuse skeletal osteoporosis have been recognized increasingly as a presenting manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism[31](#core-r031).Most of the nonskeletal manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism are related to the elevated serum calcium level, whereas the skeletal changes are directly due to the osteoclastic activity generated by the excess hormone, which results in characteristic subperiosteal erosions and diffuse osteopenia[31,32](#core-r031). If unchecked, sustained hyperparathyroidism can eventually result in the development of hemorrhagic destructive lytic brown tumors and severe skeletal deformities, so-called osteitis fibrosa cystica. The frequency of brown tumors and osteitis fibrosa cystica has decreased greatly in recent years, probably as a result of earlier diagnosis. This patient's brown tumor is probably a reflection of her longstanding untreated disease.Dr. Scully: Dr. White, will you give the follow-up findings on the patient?Dr. White: She underwent neck exploration four weeks after the biopsy and was found to have a parathyroid adenoma, which was excised. Her calcium level has become normal, and her pain has markedly diminished. Her mobility problem still exists, and she is undergoing physical therapy.Dr. Chew: Two views of the right humerus on postoperative films continue to show profound osteopenia, but the area where the osteolytic lesion had been seen previously is now filled in with bone and has become sclerotic, a finding consistent with a healing brown tumor.\n",

      "question": "First admission.\nA fifty-five-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of jaundice.\nApproximately three weeks before entry she noticed the onset of nausea, anorexia and malaise. She occasionally vomited, the vomitus containing recently eaten food; there was no blood or bile. She was unable to retain much of anything for four or five days, felt weak and tired, and lost several pounds in weight. At about the same time she had a mild upper respiratory infection. One week later she noticed that her eyes and skin were yellowish, the jaundice becoming progressively more marked up until the time of admission. There was no history of acute or severe pain, although the patient did have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen ten days before admission. She was seen by her physician, who put her on a low-fat diet. Subsequently, her appetite improved and the nausea diminished, but the jaundice increased. The urine was very dark, and the stools were light gray. She had no chills or fever.\nThe patient had no previous history of jaundice, dark urine or light stools. For a number of years she had avoided spicy or greasy foods because they resulted in epigastric distress. During a laparotomy one year before, the gall bladder was explored and said to be normal. She had received no transfusions or plasma within the past year. She had not been exposed to any liver toxins. She had not been in contact with any jaundiced person. She indulged in alcohol only occasionally.\nThe patient had typhoid fever as a child. One year before entry a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed for what apparently was a malignant ovarian cyst. She had gained weight during the past year.\nA sister had died of carcinoma of the uterus.\nPhysical examination revealed a deeply jaundiced, well developed, well nourished woman. There were no ecchymoses, excoriations or adenopathy. The liver was percussed at the sixth rib and felt two fingerbreadths below the costal margin. The liver edge was sharp and nontender. The tip of the spleen was palpable on deep inspiration.\nThe temperature and pulse were normal. The blood pressure was 150 systolic, 80 diastolic.\nLaboratory studies revealed a dark-amber urine, with a + test for albumin, a ++ test for bile and urobilinogen present in dilution of 1:20. The white-cell count was 4400, with 65 per cent neutrophils. The hemoglobin was 13.6 gm. The van den Bergh reaction was 9.2 mg. per 100 cc. direct, 12.2 mg., indirect, and the total protein was 6.4 gm. per 100 cc., with an albumin of 4.20 gm. and a globulin of 2.26 gm. (albumin-globulin ratio of 1.86). The prothrombin time was 22 seconds (normal, 18 seconds). The nonprotein nitrogen was 22 mg. per 100 cc., and the serum amylase 20 units. A cephalin-flocculation test was +++ in twenty-four and forty-eight hours; the thymol turbidity was 7.0 units, and the alkaline phosphatase 12.8 units. A stool was light brown and guaiac negative.\nA roentgenogram showed no evidence of esophageal varices. The gastric rugae were regular, and peristalsis was active. No defects were noted in the gastric or duodenal wall.\nThe patient was placed on a high-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat diet, and vitamins. Over the course of the next five weeks she showed more or less slowly progressive improvement. She became less icteric, her appetite increased, and she gained weight and strength. The van den Bergh reaction, which had risen as high as 17.9 mg. per 100 cc. direct, 21.8 mg. indirect, fell to 9.8 mg. direct, 13.6 mg. indirect. Although still moderately jaundiced, she was discharged on the forty-third hospital day, with instructions to remain on the prescribed diet and on bed-and-chair rest until the jaundice disappeared.\nSecond admission\n(approximately three months later). In the interval the patient had never felt completely well, nor had she been completely free of jaundice, although she had spent this time quietly at home and had remained on a low-fat diet. Three weeks before readmission the jaundice deepened, with associated pain in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant of the abdomen, radiating across the back. She also had some pain in the left shoulder. The pain was not sharp but of a dull, aching nature. It was intermittent and especially prominent when she was tired. The stools were light brown; the urine was darker during the two weeks before entry. She had no itching. The appetite had been good up until two days before admission.\nOn physical examination she was again found to be jaundiced. There was some mild epigastric tenderness. The spleen was palpable. The liver could not be felt. There was no edema or ascites. There were no spider angiomas. The temperature, pulse and respirations were within normal limits.\nLaboratory examination revealed a dark-amber urine, which gave a + test for albumin and a ++ test for bile. The alkaline phosphatase was 8.8 units per 100 cc. The nonprotein nitrogen was 27 mg., and the total protein 7.54 gm. per 100 cc., with an albumin of 3.90 gm. and a globulin of 3.64 gm. (albumin-globulin ratio of 1.1); the van den Bergh reaction was 9.8 mg. per 100 cc. direct, 11.9 mg. indirect, and the cephalin-flocculation test was ++++ in twenty-four hours. The prothrombin time was 28 seconds (normal, 19 seconds). The stools were light brown, guaiac negative and slightly positive for bile.\nOn the sixth hospital day a peritoneoscopy was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Wyman Richardson\\*: Was this woman an Italian?Dr. Benjamin Castleman: It is not noted.Dr. Richardson: Do we know anything more about the blood smear? I belabor this point about blood smears without expecting anyone of my own generation to pay any attention to it.Dr. C. W. Fairlie: There was moderate achromia and moderate variation in the size of the red blood cells, which were slightly larger than normal.Dr. Richardson: In women, this is not so significant. Women have a wide variation in red-cell size, presumably because of iron loss for a long period. The presence of virus lymphocytes would be of interest, but that depends on more experience in blood-smear interpretation.I was going to ask why a patient with jaundice should be discharged without a more definite diagnosis than appeared to have been established. Certainly, in retrospect, it does not seem as if she should have been, because in three months she was not completely well or completely free of jaundice, although it lessened somewhat.The liver appeared to be small. The upper limit of dullness is not given. The globulin increased up to an abnormal range. It would be interesting to know whether or not the prothrombin time was controlled by vitamin K.Dr. Fairlie: I know that she received Hykinone, but I cannot say that she was getting it at that time.Dr. Richardson: It is sometimes used as a test of intrinsic liver disease. An elevated prothrombin time will not return to normal with the use of vitamin K whereas in the straight obstructive type of jaundice it will usually return rapidly to normal unless the obstruction is of very long duration.It is rather a confusing picture to me. I first tried to determine whether she had intrinsic orextrinsic disease of the liver. The evidence in favor of some intrinsic disease is the increased globulin, the reversal of the albumin-globulin ratio, which may account for the increasing cephalin-flocculation test. The suggestion is that in the course of three months this patient developed evidence of hepatic failure and intrinsic liver disease. The problem is, Would obstruction of the biliary tract result in obstructive biliary cirrhosis in this length of time and produce evidence of hepatic failure? I do not believe it would, and there is significant evidence against this picture. Also, obstructive biliary cirrhosis would be associated with a gradually enlarging liver. That brings up the question of urinary urobilinogen. This test looks very well on paper. Urinary urobilinogen is the urobilinogen that is formed in the gastrointestinal tract, reabsorbed and, for some reason, not readily excreted through the liver again, being excreted in the urine. Therefore, one would have to assume that the bile escaped from the liver into the gastrointestinal tract, and that would mean that there was little or no obstruction. The trouble is that urobilinogen does not seem to work the way it is supposed to. In infectious hepatitis, the urobilinogen is usually greatly increased in the beginning. When mechanical obstruction is complete, the urobilinogen in the urine at first goes up, and then disappears. The trouble is that, although that is a typical curve, it is not a constant curve. One gets all kinds of queer curves, and I find it difficult to interpret them. The alkaline phosphatase in this case dropped to normal levels in two or three months. The evidence points to intrinsic disease of the liver. The reason I ask whether the patient was Italian is that Italian-born people more frequently develop portal cirrhosis of the liver than others.If we assume that this was intrinsic liver disease, what could it have been? With subacute degeneration of the liver or subacute atrophy for whatever reason, one almost invariably gets fever if there is enough disease to affect the liver. I think on the basis of lack of fever one could fairly well rule out such a diagnosis. I do not know the final course of this patient, but it is probable that peritoneoscopy determined the diagnosis. She may have had infectious hepatitis, but that is a risky diagnosis in a fifty-five-year-old woman or older. The reason I would like to see the blood smear is that I believe the diagnosis could be established by a blood smear. All the patients I have seen with rising globulin have had fever. We have seen 2 patients with greatly enlarged livers and the diagnosis pathologically was not clear \u2014 a peculiar kind of chronic hepatitis. If the patient had underlying disease she might well have had a mild degree of cirrhosis, although that does not account for the picture as it occurred in this case. That brings up the problem of whether she had tumor in addition, and we come to the question of the apparent malignant lesion two years previously. Would this have been metastatic disease to the liver? In such cases the liver gets very large. Here, the liver appeared to be smaller.Dr. Castleman: The statement is made that an apparently malignant ovarian cyst was removed. We have no further information about it, however.Dr. Richardson: We do not know, really, but I suppose it might well have been malignant. I will have to say that this picture was not that of obstructive biliary cirrhosis, and therefore that it was intrahepatic disease. Patients with cirrhosis alone do not develop severe jaundice, as a rule, unless there is additional disease, and they are likely to have varices and ascites, neither of which appeared in this patient. The spleen was enlarged. Where does that come in? It suggests portal hypertension and is in favor of intrinsic liver disease. Splenomegaly is not usually seen in metastatic tumor until late in the course of the disease. The splenic enlargement, the lack of fever and the gradually increasing evidence of hepatic failure shown by the chemical tests make me believe that she had intrinsic liver disease, probably cirrhotic in nature, and not hepatitis or superimposed infection because of lack of fever. On the other hand, the process seems to have increased so rapidly that one should think of complicating disease in the liver, most likely a malignant lesion.I was prepared to say that this patient had underlying cirrhosis of the liver with superimposed hepatoma. I want to know what the diaphragm looked like, since a hepatoma on the superior surface might push the diaphragm up, but no x-ray film of the chest was taken at the second admission\u2014at least, there is no report in the protocol.Dr. James J. McCort. No.Dr. Richardson: As far as the diagnosis goes, I think Dr. Fairlie will excuse me if I think it was more proper to do peritoneoscopy or liver punch biopsy at the first admission when the prothrombin time was normal, rather than at the time when there was considerable risk in doing it, with a comparatively elevated prothrombin time. I do not know,\u2014I am perhaps going to get badly stuck, \u2014 but I am not going to say stone in the common duct because I cannot see how this degree of hepatic failure under these conditions would cause the findings mentioned; it does not seem to have been straight obstructive jaundice. Finally, because the patient once had a malignant tumor, one perhaps could better explain the picture on the basis of the original tumor and therefore postulate metastatic disease from the ovary that was removed, but any metastatic involvement of the liver seems improbable because the liver appears to have been smaller rather than larger. With an underlying cirrhosis of the liver, the malignant tumor would most likely be hepatoma.I would like to say one word about the low white-cell count \u2014 that is, it is simply evidence of a congested spleen. Whenever one has an enlarged spleen from congestion, there is reduction in the white-cell count.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Castleman: At the first admission, the reason a peritoneoscopy was not done, at least, as I gather from the record, was that the patient was considered to be improving and that she probably had infectious hepatitis. Metastatic cancer was put as another possibility, and it was thought advisable to watch her for a while.The biopsy was done through a peritoneoscope, and it showed acute infectious hepatitis. There was infiltration with lymphocytes and monocytes in the portal areas, and extending into the liver lobules, quite characteristic of infectious hepatitis without any evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis. Dr. Fairlie, will you tell what has happened after that?Dr. Fairlie: During the second hospital stay the jaundice lessened although it did not disappear. The van den Bergh reaction was 2.8 mg. per 100 cc. The patient went home again on a dietary and semi-bed-rest regime after five weeks in the hospital. Three days after going home she had a severe recurrence of epigastric and right-upper-quadrant pain, similar to that described in the protocol. At the same time she was deeply jaundiced. Three weeks later she was readmitted. The blood chemical findings were much the same as before. There was a rather striking dissociation between the van den Bergh reaction and the other liver-function tests. The others were mildly disturbed, whereas the van den Bergh reaction was 23 mg. per 100 cc., the highest yet. At this admission, she failed to improve. The right-upper-quadrant pain ceased, but the jaundice deepened. Ascites appeared, and terminally she went into coma and died.Dr. Castleman: Autopsy showed about 4 or 5 liters of ascitic fluid. The liver was small, weighing about 1100 gm. It proved to be a very interesting liver. It showed small islands of regeneration but other areas were fresh salmon pink and smooth, without any liver tissue at all, and fibrotic We have then the development of cirrhosis following infectious hepatitis. The infectious hepatitis had begun ten months before she died, so that she had what may be called chronic infectious hepatitis for ten months. This is longer than the usual case but apparently fits in with the cases reported by Jersild.[\\*](#core-r001) He described an epidemic in Copenhagen of infectious hepatitis in women beyond the menopause. Of 123 cases 99 per cent were in women, and 79 per cent in women over fifty years of age. In these cases the disease began slowly and ended in death in 60 per cent of the patients, with an average duration of nine months. He speculated on the idea that the estrogens may exert a liver-protecting influence against infection.Dr. Richardson: The patients I have seen of somewhat similar type have all had febrile reaction.Dr. Castleman: I looked at her chart, and it is completely flat.Dr. Richardson: Even at the last admission?Dr. Castleman: Yes.Dr. Richardson: That is too bad. That spoiled it.Dr. Castleman: I have slides showing the difference between the two liver sections. This is the biopsy of the liver ([Fig. 1](#f001)). The architecture is normal except for the infiltration of cells in the portal areas. There is no fibrosis at all throughout the liver. The next slide is the one taken at autopsy ([Fig. 2](#f002)). Here are islands of regeneration, filled with bile; under high power one can see the bile thrombi and in between are the areas where the liver cells have been wiped out. The only remnants are these bile ducts.A Physician: What was the time interval?Dr. Castleman: Eight months between biopsy and autopsy.The spleen weighed 370 gm. and showed only congestion.Dr. Richardson: I have something I want to point out \u2014 that is, this patient always improved in the hospital. The minute she got home, she was worse again.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Soheyla D. Gharib:\nA 37-year-old American man living in Vietnam was transferred to this hospital because of fever and bacteremia.\nThe patient, who lived and worked in a city in Vietnam, had been well until approximately 1 month before the current admission, when episodes of throbbing discomfort in the right upper quadrant (described as \u201crolling spasms\u201d) developed; the episodes lasted for approximately 20 to 30 minutes at a time and resolved without treatment after 5 days. Approximately 2.5 weeks before the current admission, fevers, shaking chills, and body aches developed; the patient took ibuprofen but the symptoms did not improve. The next day, he was seen by a physician at an infirmary for international persons. Acetaminophen was administered; the fever reportedly abated, and the patient returned home. During the night, the temperature rose to 40.6\u00b0C, with rigors. He returned to the infirmary and was admitted to one of two inpatient beds.\nThe patient had previously been well. He had no known allergies. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was married and had two young children. He was born in and had lived in New England until 10 years earlier, when he moved to Vietnam. He was a professor at an academic institution in Massachusetts. He lived in an urban apartment complex and took occasional trips to Cambodia and New England. He had not traveled during the previous month. He had received all the indicated vaccines before moving to Vietnam and had had no recent exposure to sick persons.\nA physical examination was reportedly normal. The bilirubin level was reportedly mildly elevated, and laboratory tests were negative for dengue NS1 antigen, malaria, antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),\nSalmonella typhi\nH and O antigens,\nS. paratyphi\nAH and BH antigens, cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, parasites, IgM antibodies to chikungunya virus, antigens to influenza virus types A and B, and group A streptococcal pharyngitis; other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Urinalysis and a chest radiograph were normal. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and omeprazole were administered, without improvement. During the next 2 days, the temperature rose intermittently to 41.0\u00b0C, with rigors. A transthoracic echocardiogram reportedly showed trace mitral regurgitation and mild left atrial dilatation. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a mildly enlarged liver (midclavicular longitudinal dimension, 17 to 18 cm; upper limit of normal, 13 to 15 cm) and splenomegaly (length of the spleen, 14.9 cm). On the third day at the infirmary, results of computed tomography (CT) of the chest were normal; CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed an enlarged liver and spleen. Other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nOn the fourth day at the infirmary, fevers persisted. On the recommendation of a physician in Massachusetts, the patient was transferred to an international hospital in Thailand. On admission, the blood pressure was 140/78 mm Hg, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the temperature 38.1\u00b0C (several hours after acetaminophen had been administered), and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute; the remainder of the examination was normal. The activated partial-thromboplastin time and estimated glomerular filtration rate were normal, as were the red-cell indexes and blood levels of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and globulin. Tests were negative for dengue NS1 antigen, malaria (by means of polymerase-chain-reaction assay), influenza virus types A and B, HIV, IgM antibodies to chikungunya virus, and hepatitis B and C viruses; other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Urinalysis revealed yellow, slightly turbid urine, with 1+ protein and blood, urobilinogen, and 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 5) and was otherwise normal. A stool examination was reportedly negative for parasites. Radiographs of the chest and paranasal sinuses were reportedly normal; a radiograph of the abdomen, obtained with the patient in an upright position, showed a small calcification at the left side of the pelvic cavity that was thought to be a phlebolith or bladder stone. CT images of the abdomen that were obtained at the infirmary were reviewed and thought to show hepatosplenomegaly. Potassium chloride was administered.\nDuring the patient\u2019s first full day at the international hospital (the seventh day of the febrile illness), abdominal ultrasonography revealed hepatosplenomegaly, a hepatic cyst (0.9 cm in diameter) at segment VI, and a hyperechoic nodule (1.7 cm in diameter) at the right lobe, anterior to the inferior vena cava, that was thought to represent a hepatic hemangioma. During the next 2 days, the temperature rose to between 38.0\u00b0C and 39.8\u00b0C.\nOn the fourth hospital day, doxycycline therapy was begun for possible rickettsial infection. Later that day, one of three blood cultures that had been obtained on the day of admission grew gram-positive cocci in chains; the cocci were identified as\nStreptococcus constellatus\n, subspecies\nconstellatus\n. Ceftriaxone therapy (2 g daily) was begun, and doxycycline therapy was stopped. The next day, a transesophageal echocardiogram showed trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, with no evidence of endocarditis; the ejection fraction was 62%. The patient began to feel better. On the sixth hospital day, after 12 days of illness, fevers resolved. Repeat blood cultures were sterile. Blood levels of electrolytes, globulin, alpha-fetoprotein, and prostate-specific antigen were normal; other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nThe physician in Massachusetts recommended that the patient undergo additional testing. On the seventh hospital day, CT of the abdomen (performed after the intravenous, oral, and rectal administration of contrast material) reportedly revealed abdominal lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, multiple hypodense nodular lesions in the liver, enlargement and heterogeneous enhancement of the pancreatic head, and thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein. Specialists in hematology and gastroenterology were consulted. Endoscopic ultrasonography was scheduled, and anticoagulation was begun. The CA 19-9 level was normal.\nOn the 11th hospital day, CT images were transmitted to this hospital for review. The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation and management.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Gharib:* I was the physician in Massachusetts who urged this patient to come home, and I am aware of the diagnosis. I will discuss three aspects of this case. First, I will review the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain and fever with bacteremia, which were the features of this patient\u2019s presentation when I first heard about him. Next, I will discuss the differential diagnosis of thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein. Finally, I will discuss the treatment of a patient who is in a remote international setting.\n### Abdominal Pain and Fever\n\nThe differential diagnosis of abdominal pain and fever is broad. I had understood that the patient\u2019s pain, which he described as \u201crolling spasms,\u201d was in the upper abdomen. Acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, gallstone pancreatitis, acute pancreatitis, and pneumonia in the lower lung fields would all be on this list. These were concerns at first, but by the time he arrived at Bumrungrad International Hospital in Thailand, the pain had resolved and the more pressing issue was that his blood culture had grown *S. constellatus*.\n### *S. constellatus* Bacteremia\n\n*S. constellatus* is a member of the *S. milleri* group, which is a member of the viridans group of streptococci. *S. milleri* are commensal organisms; they are usually not pathogenic. *S. constellatus* is part of the normal flora of the human oral cavity. It is a facultative anaerobe whose distinguishing feature is its ability to cause abscesses.*S. milleri* infections usually affect the mouth and throat, causing dental, peritonsillar, or sinus abscesses. Spread of abscesses to deep spaces can lead to septic thrombophlebitis of the jugular vein (Lemierre\u2019s syndrome). Bacteremia can occur, leading to metastatic abscess formation in the lung, brain, liver, kidney, and other tissues. Endocarditis can also occur, usually in a patient with an abnormal heart valve.[1](#core-r001) Despite the usual commensal status of *S. constellatus*, the bacteria is considered to be a true pathogen when it is found in the blood, as it was in this case.The finding of *S. constellatus* bacteremia mandates a search for an abscess. The key questions are the location of the abscess and the reason that it developed. In this case, a possible location was the oral cavity, with septic spread of infection to the liver. However, examination of the patient\u2019s ear, nose, throat, and sinus films had been normal. A more worrisome concern was the possibility of a liver abscess. Abdominal CT scans had shown an enlarged liver and hypodense lesions in the liver, and the patient had had abnormal results on liver-function tests.Liver abscess is the most common type of visceral abscess, accounting for approximately 13% of intraabdominal abscesses.[2](#core-r002) Risk factors include diabetes, hepatobiliary or pancreatic diseases, or *Klebsiella pneumoniae* infection due to host factors (e.g., glucocorticoid therapy, alcoholism, chronic disease, or neoplasia). Many case reports of klebsiella-related liver abscesses are from Asia. Often, such cases are associated with a subsequent diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The pathogenesis of a liver abscess can include bowel leakage and peritonitis, direct spread of biliary infection or underlying biliary disease (e.g., gallstones or obstruction), and occasionally, spread of infection from penetrating wounds.[3](#core-r003) The mortality rate associated with a liver abscess can be as high as 12%.[4](#core-r004)\n### Thrombosis of the Superior Mesenteric Vein\n\nAn additional concern was the thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein, which was seen on the second CT scan. In a 2001 review of 43 cases of radiographically occult thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein (i.e., thrombosis that is not detected initially but is detected with further evaluation),[5](#core-r005) 20 patients had recently undergone abdominal surgery, 14 had hypercoaguable states, and 20 had infections. The infections included appendicitis, diverticular abscess, urinary-tract infection, infected ascites, sepsis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, pneumonia, and *Clostridium difficile* infection; in other words, the full spectrum of infectious diseases can result in thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein.At the time, I thought that, although the patient\u2019s condition had improved with antibiotic therapy, there still had to be an abscess somewhere, most likely in the liver. I recommended that he return to Massachusetts for surgical exploration.\n### Treatment of a Patient Who Is in a Remote International Setting\n\nFortunately, this patient\u2019s employer had contracted with a global-services company, which provides medical and travel security assistance. Such companies offer evacuation for political and security reasons, medical evacuation, treatment at international assistance centers, ambulance services, and access to extensive provider networks. The company that was used in this case serves 70 countries with a combined total of 27 international assistance centers; it has 35 clinics, employs 4800 physicians and nurses, and has a database that includes information on the quality of hospitals and clinics, many of which are in low-resource settings.[6](#core-r006) Many of these global-services companies were established in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when an increasing number of American businesses were developing robust global networks.However, despite the safety nets that these global-services intermediaries offer, there are many challenges in treating a patient who is in a remote international setting. The global-services company has an interest in retaining the patient in the country where he or she is currently located; however, it is difficult to assess the quality of the medical care in that setting. Patients\u2019 confidence in the medical facilities and personnel can vary, but often, the patients themselves do not want to leave the country.In this case, the patient and his father were very confident in the care that was being provided at the international hospital in Thailand. Indeed, it is an award-winning hospital with Joint Commission International accreditation; the global-services company had given the facility its highest rating.[6](#core-r006) Furthermore, neither the patient nor his parents lived in Massachusetts. The patient lived in Vietnam with his wife and family and was eager to return home to his newborn baby. He also felt completely well and was afebrile.However, the history of *S. constellatus* bacteremia with an unknown source was considered a medical emergency. In addition, the thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein was most likely the result of a clinically significant intraabdominal infection and warranted further workup. Eventually, the patient was persuaded to return to Massachusetts for surgical intervention for what I believed was probably a liver abscess.\n\nImaging Studies\n---------------\n\n*Dr. Garry Choy:* CT images were securely transmitted from Thailand through an online teleradiology platform that is operated by the Second Opinion Service and Imaging Global Health Programs in the radiology department of this hospital. Contrast-enhanced CT images of the abdomen and pelvis ([Figure 1](#f01) and [Figure 2](#f02); and [Videos 1 and 2](#v01), available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) showed a linear, hyperdense foreign body embedded in the head of the pancreas. There was minimal fat stranding adjacent to the head of the pancreas, a finding consistent with focal pancreatitis. The foreign body distally traversed the wall of the superior mesenteric vein. In addition, there was a filling defect in the superior mesenteric vein that extended to the portal vein, a finding consistent with thrombus. Additional subcentimeter hypodensities (1 to 3 mm in diameter) were present in the liver that could represent small hepatic cysts, but given the features of this patient\u2019s clinical presentation, microabscesses were also possible.Subsequently, electronic and hard copies of the initial CT images \u2014 which had been obtained without the administration of contrast material 8 days earlier, when the patient was in Vietnam \u2014 were also provided. These images ([Figure 3](#f03)) showed that, earlier in the disease course, the foreign body was not yet as deeply embedded in the pancreas; the proximal portion was still partially residing in the lumen of the duodenum and was only partially embedded in the pancreatic head. Therefore, the sequential CT images showed migration of the foreign body during the week-long period.Overall, the imaging studies showed an ingested foreign body that perforated the duodenum and became embedded in the pancreas. The appearance of the foreign body is most consistent with a fish bone, although other foreign bodies \u2014 such as a toothpick, metal tine, or needle \u2014 may also have a similar linear, hyperdense appearance.\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n### Ingestion of a Fish Bone\n\n*Dr. Gharib:* This patient appeared to have unknowingly ingested a fish bone, which was undoubtedly the cause of his initial upper abdominal pain and his subsequent *S. constellatus* bacteremia. The first reported case of a fish-bone ingestion was noted in Rolleston\u2019s *Diseases of the Liver, Gall-Bladder, and Bile Ducts* (published in 1905), which references a case by Lambron that was published in the *Archives G\u00e9n\u00e9rales de M\u00e9decine* in 1842. The case was remarkably similar to this one; a \u201cfish-bone passed from the stomach into the superior mesenteric vein and set up pylephlebitis.\u201d[7](#core-r007)There have been many case reports of fish-bone ingestion in the literature. Most of these cases occur in Southeast Asia, because some of the fish there have smaller bones, as compared with the fish in Western regions. For example, between June and August in 1986, 117 cases of fish-bone ingestion were reported at Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong.[8](#core-r008) The fish bones were usually invisible on plain films, and the symptoms were a better guide in determining the ultimate location of the fish bone. This was true in this case; the patient\u2019s initial symptom was pain in the upper abdomen, where the fish bone had pierced the duodenum. In cases such as this one, the most common complication is a liver abscess, but esophageal perforation with deep-neck infection, a thyroid abscess, and tongue and mediastinal abscesses have also been reported.A 1999 case report from Japan included a review of seven previously reported cases of fish-bone ingestion.[9](#core-r009) Hepatic abscess had occurred in all cases; in four cases, the fish bones penetrated the stomach wall (three penetrated the left lobe of the liver and one penetrated the right lobe), and in three cases, the fish bones pierced the duodenum. In the case report, culture of the liver-abscess aspirate grew *S. constellatus*, the organism that was seen in this patient. The case report from Japan also noted that few patients were aware that they had ingested a fish bone, which was also true in this case.\n### Surgical Management\n\n*Dr. David L. Berger:* From a surgical perspective, the most interesting aspect of this case was the location of the fish bone. The proximal tip of the fish bone was no longer located in the duodenum, and the distal tip seemed to reside in the uncinate process. The fish bone traversed the superior mesenteric vein, which was thrombosed.Consequently, I could work with neither the proximal tip nor the distal tip during the procedure. I needed a way to access the fish bone and remove it while doing as little damage as possible. It seemed best to try to approach the fish bone at the junction of the inferior border of the pancreatic neck, where the bone came over the top of the superior mesenteric vein. My hope was to enter that space, find the fish bone, divide it there, and withdraw the superior and inferior pieces. It was possible to visualize this approach on CT imaging.I was able to carry out this approach as planned. I opened the abdomen, separated the omentum from the transverse colon, and opened the lesser sac. I identified the superior mesenteric vein as it coursed underneath the pancreas, and I began to dissect superomedially above the superior mesenteric vein, into the inferior aspect of the pancreas. There was marked inflammation, which led me to the fish bone. I dissected a few millimeters inferiorly and superiorly until more of the bone could be visualized. I placed metal clips on each end of the bone, so that the cut bone pieces would not retract out of my field, and I cut the bone in the middle. After I cut the bone, the two sections could be removed without difficulty ([Figure 4A](#f04)). The superior mesenteric vein was thrombosed, so it had no clinically significant bleeding. I placed a drain in the lesser sac, abutting the area of the pancreas where I performed the dissection, and I closed the abdomen.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Amelia E. Huck:* We received two fragments of bone, each with a surgical clip ([Figure 4B](#f04)). The bone was decalcified and processed for histologic examination, which confirmed that it was a cortical bone ([Figure 4C](#f04)). In contrast to mammals and similar to birds, fish have nucleated red cells in their circulation, which can be a distinguishing histologic feature. Only cortical bone and scant bone marrow were present in this sample, and thus the morphologic features were not unique to fish; however, the gross appearance is consistent with a fish bone.*Dr. Berger:* The patient recovered without complication and was discharged on the 11th day at this hospital. He initially returned to Vietnam but has since relocated to Massachusetts.*Dr. Choy:* Follow-up CT of the abdomen and pelvis (with the intravenous administration of contrast material) was performed 4 days after discharge and revealed a gradual decrease in the degree of fat stranding and inflammatory changes at the pancreatic head. The hepatic hypodensities were unchanged in number and distribution. Persistent thrombus was seen in the superior mesenteric vein.*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): We are fortunate to have the patient with us today. Would you care to comment?*The Patient:* I appreciate the efforts to keep my identity hidden, but I have lived most of my adult life in Southeast Asia, where there is no concept of patient confidentiality.One of the turning points in my case was receiving help from a family friend of mine while I was in Vietnam. In that part of the world, connections are important, and this family friend is a very prominent Vietnamese physician who works with Harvard Medical School. He called the infirmary to get all the details on my case and then called me and said, \u201cYou know, I love my country, but I think you need to leave it now.\u201dI want to say how deeply grateful I am to Dr. Gharib, Dr. Berger, Dr. Choy, and everyone else at Massachusetts General Hospital and especially to my parents, who came out to be with me in Thailand.When I was a little boy, my mother was always on my case because I didn\u2019t chew my food enough. It took 37 years for those chickens to come home to roost, but they really did. The local fish in Vietnam have very small bones, and I was always afraid of swallowing one, so I generally avoided fish. In fact, I now remember the dinner at which I ingested the bone.Mine was a case that could only have happened in the age of globalization \u2014 the bone came from a piece of salmon that had been imported to Vietnam from Norway. I thought it was safe to eat, since I thought salmon didn\u2019t have small bones. When I fell ill, I was treated in three countries: Vietnam, Thailand, and the United States.My father was with me the whole time in Thailand and again at Massachusetts General Hospital. Do you have a perspective on it?*The Patient\u2019s Father:* As a humble family physician from Connecticut, I found it interesting to fly to Thailand to see a truly wonderful hospital. My son was getting great care. From a doctor\u2019s perspective, an amusing thing happened on day 10, when I was walking by the nurses\u2019 station in the hospital lobby. The surgeon who was consulted on the case waved me over to the nurses\u2019 station and said, \u201cI want you to see something.\u201d He was looking at the CT images. He said, \u201cThe radiologists have been looking at it for days, and now they think he may have a fish bone in his pancreas.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, come on. Are you kidding me? I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d I walked into my son\u2019s room and said, \u201cNow these doctors think you have a fish bone in your pancreas.\u201d Well, sure enough, the images were electronically sent to Dr. Choy, who e-mailed me back a few hours later and said, \u201cYou know, I think he\u2019s got a fish bone in his pancreas.\u201d I\u2019ve been in practice for over 30 years, and I\u2019ve never seen it or heard of it, and perhaps none of you have, either.\n",

      "question": "A 67-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of dysphagia, epigastric pain, and a mass at the esophagogastric junction.\nShe was well until 8 to 10 months earlier, when she began to experience dysphagia for solid food but not for liquids. Several months before admission she began to regurgitate food intermittently when recumbent. Two months before entry epigastric pain on swallowing solid food developed. An upper gastrointestinal series, performed elsewhere, showed an esophageal mass. The patient was referred to this hospital. X-ray films of the chest (\nFig. 1\n) revealed a large, calcified, doughnut-shaped density behind the heart and anterior to the spine; no air-fluid level or other mass was seen, and the heart and lungs appeared normal. Another upper gastrointestinal series disclosed a small axial hiatus hernia that was encased and deformed by the calcified mass at the esophagogastric junction (\nFig. 2\n); there was good filling of the stomach, and the gastric fundus was normally distended; slight dilatation of the esophagus was observed. She was admitted to the hospital.\nThe patient was a retired electronics assembly worker. A transabdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed 27 years earlier for what the patient understood to be \"cancer.\" An appendectomy and multiple biopsies of benign breast lesions were performed more recently. A hiatus hernia was reported on an upper gastrointestinal series seven years before admission. Four years later a compressed vertebra was found after a fall. The patient lost 3 kg in weight during the two months preceding entry. There was no history of peptic-ulcer disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, or use of tobacco or more than occasional alcohol.\nThe temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the pulse was 70, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 125/70 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared well. The head and neck were normal, and the lungs were clear; the heart was normal. No masses were palpated in the breasts. No organs were palpable, and no mass or tenderness was found on abdominal examination. There was no peripheral edema; the pulses were intact in the lower extremities. Rectal examination was negative, and a stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. Neurologic examination was negative.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 51.7 percent, the white-cell count 4900, and the hemoglobin 17.2 g per 100 ml; an automated differential count revealed 63 percent neutrophils, 31 percent lymphocytes, and 6 percent monocytes. The platelet count was 116,000. The prothrombin time was 9.4 seconds, with a control of 10.9 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 24.4 seconds. The urea nitrogen was 5.0 mmol per liter (14 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 5.1 mmol per liter (91 mg per 100 ml), the bilirubin 9 \u03bcmol per liter (0.5 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 2.3 mmol per liter (9.3 mg per 100 ml), and the phosphorus 1.2 mmol per liter (3.8 mg per 100 ml). The sodium was 141 mmol, and the potassium 4.0 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase was 13 U, the amylase 66 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 15 U per liter. An electrocardiogram disclosed a normal rhythm at a rate of 73, with minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Francis J. Scholz\\*: I shall begin with a review of the pertinent radiologic findings. A film of the upper portion of the abdomen shows a ring-like calcification in the lower portion of the chest just above the diaphragmatic leaflets. The oblique projection ([Fig. 1](#f001)) also demonstrates the ring-like appearance. A film obtained in a different obliquity again shows a ring-like, very dense calcification, tightly clustered. The first film selected from the gastrointestinal series demonstrates a normal appearance of the esophagus. The barium then entered into the center of the calcification ([Fig. 2](#f002)). The mucosa within it seems to be preserved. The appearance suggests a hiatus hernia that cannot distend fully, and this appearance is maintained on the next films. On every view the barium is surrounded by the calcification. The last film from the gastrointestinal series demonstrates the calcification and for the most part intact mucosal folds. One projection of barium in the center of this process could represent deformed mucosal folds or an ulcer crater.The lesion appears to be completely defined by the calcification. The lung serves as a distinct margin to the calcified process, and no evidence of an additional soft-tissue mass is shown in any projection. In the center of the calcified ring there are irregular folds consistent with those expected in a collapsed hiatus hernia. I believe that we are dealing with a lesion arising in the wall of a hiatus hernia. Thus, even though the lesion was in the chest, I think that it was agastric lesion. The two striking radiographic features are the calcification and the annular nature of the lesion.A variety of non-neoplastic and neoplastic processes may involve the entire circumference of the gastric wall in this region. Some of the more obvious possibilities are carcinoma, lymphoma, a metastatic tumor, benign inflammatory strictures, including those caused by reflux esophagitis and ingestion of caustic agents, Barrett's stricture, and postirradiation stricture. Achalasia may result in a circumferential region of narrowing in the distal esophagus. Extrinsic encasement from mediastinitis may be seen. Congenital strictures can also be responsible for areas of narrowing of the esophagus. McAfee and Donner[1](#core-r001) provided a thorough listing and a brief discussion of abdominal calcifications. Excluding lesions of the genitourinary tract, I shall mention some of the upper abdominal lesions that may calcify. In pancreatitis the acinar portion of the pancreas may calcify, and stones may be seen within the pancreatic ducts. Pseudocysts within, near, or distant from the pancreas may calcify. Biliary-tract calcifications, including gallstones, biliary stones, and \"porcelain\" gallbladder, can occur in the upper portion of the abdomen, and postinflammatory and postinfectious calcifications, such as calcifications in lymph nodes and those associated with histoplasmosis and tuberculosis, may be seen. Vascular calcifications, including those occurring in arteries involved by arteriosclerosis, aneurysms, thrombosed portal veins, and simple phleboliths, can be found in the upper portion of the abdomen. Concretions, such as enteroliths in diverticula and appendicoliths, are located occasionally in the upper portion of the abdomen. Rarely, calcified duplication cysts are found. Finally, tumors can calcify. They include leiomyoma, leiomyoblastoma, neurilemoma, hemangioma, lymphangioma, teratoma, hepatoma, cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian serous papillary carcinoma, mucinous cystadenoma, and carcinoma and metastases from breast carcinoma, sarcomas of bone, and certain other malignant tumors after therapy.Most of these causes of calcification can be discarded quickly in this case because of the location, character, and configuration of the calcification, and I believe that a neoplasm must be considered as the probable cause of this lesion. Tumors calcify in three ways. Some tumors, notably Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and certain thyroid carcinomas and their metastases, calcify only after radiotherapy or chemotherapy.[2](#core-r002) This patient had not received such therapy. Other tumors calcify because of the biochemical activity of the tumor \u2014 for example, osteogenic sarcoma, breast carcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, and teratoma. Some tumors calcify because of ischemia. This type of calcification is commonly termed \"dystrophic.\"Certain tumors that could occur in the upper portion of the abdomen are known for the development of calcification. Teratomas contain shard-like, linear, and spiculated calcifications,[3](#core-r003) sometimes with recognizable bone formation.[4](#core-r004) Pancreatic cystadenomas may have dense spiculated calcifications in a sunburst pattern.[5,6](#core-r005) Hemangiomas and lymphangiomas of the bowel may contain phleboliths,[7,8](#core-r007) and hemangiomas of the stomach with phleboliths have also been reported.[9](#core-r009) Cavernous hemangiomas of the liver may contain irregular, coarse, radiating spicules, probably related to central necrosis.[10](#core-r010) Both primary and metastatic nerve-sheath tumors may have ring-like calcifications.[5,11](#core-r005) All these tumors can be discarded from consideration because of the appearance of the calcification in this case.With focus on tumors of the stomach wall three entities must be considered. Mucinous adenocarcinomas of the stomach are known to contain calcifications. Mucinous gastric adenocarcinomas are rare, occurring much less frequently than the usual nonmucinous gastric carcinomas. Although a mucinous pattern was found on pathological examination in 5 percent of 2500 cases of cancer of the stomach reviewed at the Mayo Clinic,[12](#core-r012) it is probable that few of these tumors showed radiographic evidence of calcification. In a review of calcified mucinous (colloid) adenocarcinomas of the stomach in 1978, only 50 cases had been reported since 1913.[13](#core-r013) The presenting symptoms were variable but did not differ from those associated with typical gastric cancer, such as pain, fatigue, weight loss, ascites, anemia, and obstruction.[14\u201317](#core-r014) Mucinous adenocarcinoma tends to occur in a younger age group than typical gastric carcinoma. The age range noted in one review[18](#core-r018) was from 27 to 77 years, with an average age in the middle 40s, and since that time a mucinous adenocarcinoma was reported in a 22-year-old woman.[13](#core-r013)Mucinous adenocarcinoma may involve only one wall of the stomach or may progress to become annular. Involved portions are rigid and immobile. Computed tomographic scanning shows that the cancer causes thickening of the wall, with multiple punctate calcifications scattered throughout the tumor.[19,20](#core-r019) Lymph-node, serosal, and liver metastases from mucinous adenocarcinomas have similar calcifications.[15](#core-r015) On plain radiographs calcifications associated with these tumors are described as mottled, sand-like, stippled, miliary, or punctate, measuring from 1 to 3 mm.[13\u201316,18](#core-r013) These fine calcifications are distributed uniformly throughout the lesion. When the tumor is small the region of calcification is small and could be mistaken on a plain film for the calcification seen in chronic pancreatitis. An upper gastrointestinal series should reveal the nature of the process. When the firm, thick tumor involves the entire stomach, the deformed configuration of the gastric gas bubble does not change on plain radiographs taken days apart. The characteristic calcifications and an unchanging gas bubble permit a firm diagnosis. The cause of the calcification in mucinous tumors is unknown. The glycoprotein mucin of the tumor is similar to the glycoprotein in cartilage and has a similar tendency to calcify.[17](#core-r017) Similar calcifications have been seen in ovarian carcinoma, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland, and carcinoma of the breast, but different biochemical mechanisms may be involved in those tumors. From a review of the reported cases and one case in which I was involved I believe that the calcification in this case was too dense, too large, and too coarse to have been in a mucinous gastric adenocarcinoma.Leiomyomas are rare tumors of smooth-muscle origin that occur throughout the alimentary tract. Benign smooth-muscle tumors of the gastrointestinal tract outnumber malignant tumors by a ratio between 2:1 and 8:1. Smooth-muscle tumors account for 2.5 percent of all gastric tumors.[21](#core-r021) Of 269 clinically evident smooth-muscle tumors of the gastrointestinal tract reported from the Mayo Clinic between 1907 and 1953, 66 percent occurred in the stomach, and of those 79 percent were benign and 21 percent were malignant.[22](#core-r022) In one large series of gastric tumors 38 leiomyomas and 17 leiomyosarcomas occurred during a period when 1235 carcinomas, 34 lymphosarcomas, 31 cases with one or more adenomas, and 5 carcinoids were encountered.[23](#core-r023) In a large series of 1685 malignant gastric tumors 24 leiomyosarcomas (1.4 percent), 38 lymphomas (2.2 percent), and 1623 carcinomas were tabulated over a 20-year span.[24](#core-r024) About 60 percent of smooth-muscle tumors of the gastrointestinal tract occur between the ages of 40 and 60 years, with 20 percent diagnosed before and 20 percent diagnosed after the age of 60 years.[25](#core-r025) The tumors occur with equal frequency in either sex.Although clinically discovered gastric leiomyomas are usually solitary, in one report multiple esophageal tumors were present in 2.4 percent of the patients with these tumors.[26](#core-r026) Occasionally, the esophagus is studded with numerous leiomyomas, and this condition is termed \"diffuse esophageal leiomyomatosis.\"[27](#core-r027) It must be distinguished from regional or diffuse hypertrophy of smooth muscle, which can occur in the distal esophagus and is believed to be a neuromuscular disorder and a variant or result of diffuse esophageal spasm. In this patient the lesion was not esophageal, and neither diffuse leiomyomatosis nor muscular hypertrophy has been described in the upper portion of the stomach.The typical gastric leiomyoma is a solitary round or oval tumor that may grow into the lumen or may be completely exophytic, with no apparent deformity of the lumen. Rarely, the tumor grows into the lumen and because of the peristaltic activity of the stomach becomes pedunculated.[22,28,29](#core-r022) Some of the tumors grow both in and out, producing a dumbbell-shaped lesion. Those that have grown into the lumen are usually covered by an intact, smooth, stretched mucosa, although some have a central ulcer as a result of ischemic necrosis within the tumor. Esophageal leiomyomas do not have central ulcers.[22](#core-r022) The gastric smooth-muscle tumor may grow larger than a football and weigh more than 4 kg.[29](#core-r029) As it grows it tends to maintain its original shape, expanding from a small sphere to a large one. However, in large reported series of esophageal leiomyomas rare tumors of the distal esophagus with bizarre configurations, including U shapes, spirals, and completely annular forms, have been described.[10,30\u201332](#core-r010) One gastric leiomyoma \"shaped like half of a doughnut\" was wrapped around the cardioesophageal junction.[33](#core-r033)Both gastric[34\u201336](#core-r034) and esophageal[37,38](#core-r037) leiomyomas can undergo calcification, but it occurs in only 3.8 percent of leiomyomas of the esophagus and in only 3 percent of those in the stomach.[21](#core-r021) A calcified leiomyoma has been reported in a hiatus hernia.[35](#core-r035) The calcification in leiomyomas has been described as \"dense, focal plaques,\"[39](#core-r039) \"dense and amorphous,\"[35](#core-r035) \"irregular,\"[40](#core-r040) and \"mottled\"[33](#core-r033) and is distinctly different from the fine, punctate, discrete calcifications that occur in mucinous adenocarcinomas. The calcifications have been described as similar to those in leiomyomas of the uterus. In several series of cases of leiomyosarcoma none were calcified,[24,39,41,42](#core-r024) but case reports of calcifying leiomyosarcomas have appeared.[5,43\u201345](#core-r005) Metastases from leiomyosarcomas produce low-density lesions in the liver,[46](#core-r046) and calcification may be present within the metastases.[46,47](#core-r046)In the absence of metastases it may not be possible for the clinician, radiologist, surgeon, or even the pathologist to differentiate a benign from a malignant smooth-muscle tumor. Malignant tumors tend to be larger, tend to have central ulceration more often, and exhibit more cellular pleomorphism and mitotic activity than their benign counterparts.[48](#core-r048) Methods of counting mitotic figures to establish the diagnosis of a malignant tumor vary.[24,48,49](#core-r024) However, a lack of mitotic figures does not exclude a malignant tumor, and no criteria are reliable in differentiating malignant tumors from benign tumors 100 percent of the time.[49](#core-r049)In many of the older series of cases of smooth-muscle tumors of the esophagus and stomach no differentiation has been made between leiomyomas and leiomyoblastomas. The authors of all the recent papers in which the distinction has been made, however, stress that there is no important clinical or radiographic difference between the leiomyoma composed of spindle-shaped cells and the leiomyoblastoma, or epithelioid leiomyoma, which contains rounder cells that are sometimes clear.[50](#core-r050)As I have mentioned, on one view from the gastrointestinal series in this case there is a projection of barium that may reflect the presence of a small ulcer crater or possibly just a gastric rugal fold in the hernia. Benign and malignant smooth-muscle tumors of the stomach frequently present as a result of ulceration.[22](#core-r022) Bleeding with melena or hematemesis is the initial manifestation of about 50 percent of gastric leiomyomas.[21,42](#core-r021) Leiomyomas may contain air, indicating ulceration and fistulous communication with the lumen of the stomach. Concerning gastrointestinal bleeding I teach my residents the general rule that leiomyomas tend to gush and carcinomas tend to drip \u2014 that is, the patient with a carcinoma usually presents with chronic anemia, and the patient with a leiomyoma has episodes of life-threatening brisk bleeding. Thus, the patient with a leiomyoma or a leiomyosarcoma may have a normal hematocrit and no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in the long intervals between bleeding episodes, which may be years apart.[25](#core-r025) Complete healing of the ulcer in a leiomyoma has been demonstrated.[51](#core-r051)How does this diagnosis fit the clinical picture? The patient experienced nocturnal regurgitation and dysphagia for solid food but not for liquids. These symptoms are consistent with the rigid encasement that a leiomyoma might produce. The tumor had begun to constrict the hiatus \u2014 hence, dysphagia for solids but not liquids. Moreover, although the tumor was not allowing the hiatus hernia to expand fully to accept a solid bolus, it also was not permitting normal contraction to occur, in effect destroying the lower esophageal sphincter mechanism and permitting nocturnal reflux. In other words, the door to the stomach was held in a half-open position. This symptom complex is not unique, and virtually any constricting process can produce it.The diagnostic procedure that was performed was either an endoscopic examination or a computed tomographic (CT) scan. If the patient had a leiomyoma, at best the greater part of the lesion would not have been apparent to the endoscopist. The endoscopic examination would show only deformity of the mucosa and incomplete distensibility of the lumen. If the projection of barium was indeed an ulcer, a biopsy of the ulcer bed may have revealed a leiomyoma. If the mucosa was intact, a biopsy might not have been deep enough to penetrate normal mucosa into the leiomyoma. Caution and a small-caliber endoscope would have been necessary. If the lesion was a leiomyoma a CT scan would have shown a nonhomogeneous, centrally calcified mass encircling the hiatus hernia. With the administration of contrast material there might have been enhancement in the rim of the tumor and one or more central nonenhancing low-density areas reflecting areas of necrosis.[39,46](#core-r039) If this tumor had an exophytic component a CT scan would have shown it, but the surrounding lung defines the extent on the x-ray films of the chest, excluding any appreciable exophytic component. The full extent of some exophytic leiomyomas, those with minimal or absent deformity of the gastrointestinal wall or lumen, is evident only with CT scanning or an ultrasound study.[45,46](#core-r045) A CT scan in this case might have shown metastases in the liver or elsewhere within the abdomen, which would change my diagnosis to a leiomyosarcoma. It is a noninvasive procedure, and I would have recommended it before an endoscopic examination to prove that the patient had a single localized tumor.I stated that three entities needed to be considered, and so far I have discussed only mucinous adenocarcinoma and leiomyoma of the stomach. There is a disturbing radiographic feature of this case that I have not yet mentioned. The films reveal two calcifications on or near the upper anterior abdominal wall. One is round, and the other is coarse and ring-like. These could have been unimportant calcifications related to rib cartilage or benign calcified lymph nodes or granulomas. Could they have been metastases from the gastric lesion? Could all of them have been metastases from a tumor of the uterus or ovaries removed 27 years earlier? Sarcomas can be slow-growing, with metastases becoming apparent many years after the surgical procedure for the initial tumor.[52](#core-r052) In one reported case of a gastric leiomyosarcoma with metastases evident at the initial surgical procedure the patient survived for 29 years,[47](#core-r047) and in another case the patient survived for 36 years.[49](#core-r049) A less favorable survival rate is more typical, with a 40 percent two-year survival rate for patients with gastric leiomyosarcoma reported in one series.[49](#core-r049) The five-year survival rate for patients with a uterine leiomyosarcoma is about 20 percent.[53](#core-r053) Although dense calcifications occur in liver metastases from breast cancer,[54](#core-r054) I have never seen or read of them in soft-tissue metastases. I do not believe that this patient's prior breast operations had any role, unless someone told me that dense calcified lesions were removed from the breasts. That would make me attempt to tie everything into a single diagnosis \u2014 leiomyosarcoma of the uterus or ovary metastatic to the breast, stomach, and abdominal wall, spanning nearly three decades.I am confident that this patient did not have a malignant tumor for 27 years and did not have a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the stomach. I believe that she had a calcified leiomyoma of the stomach. With much less certainty I suggest that a CT scan was performed, followed by an endoscopic examination, although it may have been the other way around.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Ferrucci, will you comment on your impressions of this case?Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: We were struck by the appearance of the calcific deposit on the plain radiographs. To us it had an appearance similar to that of a cardiac mitral-annulus calcification because of its radiodensity and the almost complete circumferential appearance that one usually sees with a calcified mitral annulus. We considered the possibility of a calcifying adenocarcinoma in a hiatus hernia, but the calcium was too dense and the combination of calcification and a cancer in a hiatus hernia was too unlikely. On the other hand, a calcifying leiomyoma is also very rare, and the concept of total encasement of the lumen of a hiatus hernia by a calcifying leiomyoma seemed even more outlandish. Therefore, we simply turned the case over to Dr. Moncure with no help whatsoever.Dr. Scully: Dr. Pomerantz, may we have the medical students' diagnosis?Dr. Roger J. Pomerantz: The medical students considered a number of clinical entities that might present with dysphagia. They thought that a leiomyoma was most consistent with the location, the radiologic appearance including calcification, and the clinical presentation. The students wondered if the mild erythrocytosis was secondary to the leiomyoma. The diagnostic and therapeutic procedure was thought to be a thoracotomy.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Scully: Dr. Moncure, will you tell us your impressions and describe the operation?Dr. Ashby C. Moncure: This elderly patient came to me with a plain film showing the annular calcification and reported that she had experienced progressive dysphagia and weight loss. On examination I found no abnormality except evidence of recent weight loss. I took the x-ray film to the Gastrointestinal Radiology Section, and Dr. Ferrucci and others looked at it and rightly predicted that it was probably a calcified leiomyoma at the esophagogastric junction. We gave the patient some barium, and the barium flowed through it. Thus, I thought that the diagnosis was in hand. Because of her symptoms I thought that the lesion should be removed. In the operating room esophagoscopic examination showed that the mucosa was intact. A left thoracotomy was performed. We felt a gristly, freely movable, shrimp-shaped, almost perfectly round, partly calcified intramural tumor at the gastroesophageal junction and proceeded to remove it ([Fig. 3](#f003)). After the tumor was removed a large diverticulum was evident in the area, which was also resected. We restored the muscle thereafter, and the patient has done well postoperatively.Dr. Scully: Dr. Gutmann will describe the pathological findings.Dr. Edward J. Gutmann: The excised mass was C-shaped, 8 cm in length, lobulated, and very hard. Sectioning revealed firm, tan, whorled tissue containing large calcific deposits ([Fig. 4](#f004)). Microscopical examination showed that the noncalcified component of the tumor was composed of interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with elongated nuclei, characteristic of a smooth-muscle tumor ([Fig. 5](#f005)). Only mild nuclear pleomorphism was noted, and mitoses were inconspicuous. Accordingly, the pathological diagnosis in this case was a leiomyoma with extensive dystrophic calcification.Leiomyoma is the most common benign tumor of the esophagus, but it is rare in comparison to carcinoma.[26](#core-r026) Leiomyomas can occur at any level of the esophagus; most are located in the lower third.[26](#core-r026) They are twice as common in men as women.[26](#core-r026) It has been estimated that at least half the patients with an esophageal leiomyoma are asymptomatic,[26](#core-r026) and the tumor may first be detected on routine x-ray films of the chest.[38](#core-r038) Symptomatic lesions, as demonstrated by this case, may cause dysphagia and epigastric or substernal pain, which may be vague.[55](#core-r055)Leiomyomas can arise from the muscularis mucosae or either of the two layers of the muscularis propria. The rare pedunculated types project into the lumen, but most esophageal leiomyomas are 3 to 8 cm in diameter, round to oval intramural tumors.[55](#core-r055) Radiographic studies may suggest the diagnosis. At esophagoscopic examination the typical intramural leiomyoma bulges into the lumen but is covered by intact mucosa. Endoscopic biopsy through this intact mucosa is contraindicated, since it may complicate subsequent surgical removal.[55](#core-r055) Once diagnosed, the tumors are usually treated by surgical enucleation; large leiomyomas may require esophageal resection.[26](#core-r026)Leiomyoma is one of several smooth-muscle lesions of the esophagus. Diffuse leiomyomatosis refers to a diffuse thickening of esophageal musculature, often extending into the stomach, in the absence of a discrete leiomyoma.[56](#core-r056) Leiomyosarcoma is more likely to cause ulceration of the overlying mucosa,[32](#core-r032) and microscopical examination reveals a higher mitotic rate than in a leiomyoma. Although esophageal leiomyomas are biologically benign, very rarely they are lethal. A case of sudden death by asphyxiation from tracheal compression by a leiomyoma of the esophagus has been reported.[57](#core-r057)A unique feature of the case under discussion is the marked dystrophic calcification of the tumor; calcification was reported in only 2 percent of a series of 838 cases of esophageal leiomyoma.[26](#core-r026) However, today history repeats itself; 36 years ago at one of these exercises a radiologist, Dr. Richard Schatzki, was asked to discuss the case of a 57-year-old woman with upper abdominal pain.[58](#core-r058) Commenting on the films of the gastrointestinal series, which showed a broad ring of calcification surrounding the lower esophagus, Dr. Schatzki remarked: \"The x-ray findings in this woman are most unusual; I have never seen anything that came even close to this appearance.\" The pathological diagnosis in that case, as in this one, was a calcified leiomyoma. Since that earlier conference additional calcified leiomyomas have been reported,[38](#core-r038) and calcification of an esophageal tumor is now regarded as an important radiologic clue to the diagnosis of a leiomyoma.[5](#core-r005)A leiomyoma may coexist with other pathologic conditions in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The patient under discussion had a hiatus hernia, an esophageal diverticulum, and a leiomyoma of the esophagus, a rare triad, although a previous similar example has been reported.[59](#core-r059) The thoracic surgeon should be aware that a diverticulum can obscure a leiomyoma; conversely, a diverticulum may become evident only after removal of a leiomyoma. Indeed, a diverticulum was noted after the enucleation both in the case under discussion and in the case discussed by Dr. Schatzki.Seremetis and his colleagues[26](#core-r026) were no doubt correct in stating that \"No medical practitioner, gastroenterologist, or thoracic surgeon sees enough of them [esophageal leiomyomas] during his lifetime.\" Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that only one week after performing the surgical procedure in this case Dr. Moncure removed another lower esophageal mass from a 30-year-old man. The surgical specimen was virtually identical in appearance to the one in this case, except that it was not calcified. The tumor proved to be yet another example of a leiomyoma of the esophagus.Dr. Ferrucci: Dr. Moncure, I do not understand the anatomical discrepancy between the films, which seemed to show a hiatus hernia with the calcium surrounding the lumen, and your ability intraoperatively to shell out something that must have been eccentric to the lumen. Can you reconcile that, or is it only an apparent discrepancy?Dr. Moncure: The tumor was at the gastroesophageal junction but immediately under the longitudinal muscle of the esophagus. I could literally move the tumor around, and although it was in the shape of a doughnut it was sprung at one end \u2014 hence, the \"shrimp-like\" appearance. I was able to incise the overlying muscle, establish a plane of dissection, and tease it away. So it was not completely around the esophagus. Of course, the two reasons to operate on these patients are that the tumors cause symptoms and they can be malignant. Removal allows assessment of their histologic appearance, and thereafter one may judge whether more of the esophagus should be removed in an en bloc manner. Once the tumor was removed there was a clear-cut diverticulum, which was not evident on the x-ray films, and I was not aware of it when I looked at the esophagus either from the inside or from the outside. Since epiphrenic diverticula can cause symptoms, we excised it and then brought the muscle back over the suture line.\n\nAddendum\n--------\n\nDr. Moncure: When the patient was seen on follow-up examination three months after the operation she was asymptomatic.\n",

      "question": "A four-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of recurrent pancreatitis.\nThe child, who was of Egyptian and Irish descent, was born of an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Her growth and development were normal until the age of 30 months, when progressive nausea and vomiting developed, and she was admitted to another hospital. The amylase was 1132 U per milliliter. Laparotomy revealed a pancreatic pseudocyst, which was drained. The amylase fell to 190 U per milliliter, and the symptoms regressed. At the age of 33 months a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a pancreatic pseudocyst, which later underwent spontaneous resolution. A low-fat diet was prescribed, and the child remained well during the next 15 months.\nSix weeks before entry nausea and vomiting recurred, and the amylase rose to 1400 U per milliliter. One week later the amylase fell to 500 U per milliliter, but vomiting persisted and progressive abdominal distention developed. She returned to the same hospital, where parenteral hyperalimentation was instituted. The procedure was well tolerated, but two weeks before entry an x-ray film of the abdomen showed a suggestion of ascites and ileus. An ultrasound study disclosed no evidence of a pancreatic pseudocyst; the head of the pancreas was enlarged. Fever developed, and antibiotics were administered. Blood cultures were negative. Eleven days before admission an upper gastrointestinal series (\nFig. 1\n) revealed a mass in the head of the pancreas, compressing the gastric antrum and the duodenum. The hematocrit fell to 12.6 per cent, and repeated transfusions were administered; the amylase remained in the vicinity of 300 U per milliliter. A nasogastric tube was inserted and yielded coffee-grounds material; cimetidine and an antacid were begun. Two days before entry a CT scan of the abdomen revealed a thick-walled cystic structure with a central solid nidus that appeared to be within the left hepatic lobe; ascitic fluid was present. A liver\u2014spleen scan demonstrated a normal appearance of the liver. During the final few days at the other hospital the hematocrit was 34.6 per cent; the urea nitrogen was 6 mg per 100 ml (2 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 3.8 mg per 100 ml (1.2 mmol per liter), the conjugated bilirubin 0.2 mg per 100 ml (3 \u03bcmol per liter), the total bilirubin 0.3 mg per 100 ml (5 \u03bcmol per liter), and the protein 5.7 g per 100 ml. The amylase was 303 U per milliliter. She was transferred to this hospital.\nThe temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the pulse 85, and the respirations 24.\nOn examination the child was small, with normal facies and body proportions. No icterus or rash was observed. A few shotty submandibular lymph nodes were palpated. The lungs were clear, and the heart was normal. The abdomen was distended; the bowel sounds were normal. There was slight, diffuse tenderness in all four abdominal quadrants, without spasm or guarding; a tender epigastric mass, 2 by 2 cm, was felt. The extremities were normal; no polydactyly or syndactyly was found.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 31.8 per cent; the white-cell count was 14,300, with 71 per cent neutrophils. The urea nitrogen was 6 mg per 100 ml (2 mmol per liter), the glucose 136 mg per 100 ml (7.55 mmol per liter), the conjugated bilirubin 0.3 mg per 100 ml (5 \u03bcmol per liter), the total bilirubin 0.6 mg (10 \u03bcmol per liter), the calcium 10.2 mg per 100 ml (2.54 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 4.1 mg per 100 ml (1.3 mmol per liter), the triglyceride 52 mg per 100 ml, the ammonia 44 \u03bcg per 100 ml (26 \u03bcmol per liter), and the protein 6.0 g (the albumin 3.1 g and the globulin 2.9 g) per 100 ml. The sodium was 133 mmol, the potassium 4.1 mmol, the magnesium 1.5 mmol, the chloride 98 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 25 mmol. The amylase was 103 IU per liter, and the 5\u2032 nucleotidase 17.4 Bodansky U (1560 nmol. sec\n-1\nper liter). An ultrasound study of the pancreas showed a sonolucent structure, 2 cm in diameter, within the left hepatic lobe that contained a hyperechoic central region, unchanged from the appearance on studies performed elsewhere; the liver was otherwise normal, and the common bile duct was of normal size; the pancreas appeared slightly enlarged and hypoechoic; the pancreatic duct was seen briefly during real-time examination and appeared of normal diameter; the findings were similar to those on earlier studies. A test for osmotic fragility was negative.\nNasogastric drainage and parenteral hyperalimentation were instituted; ampicillin and gentamicin were infused. The temperature ranged from 37.8 to 38.3\u00b0C on most days. On the fifth hospital day a tender mass was palpable in the right upper abdominal quadrant and descended 5 cm below the right costal margin. The amylase was 97 U per milliliter, the alkaline phosphatase 55 IU (0.92 \u03bcmol. sec\n-1\n) per liter, and the 5\u2032 nucleotidase 22 Bodansky U (2000 nmol. sec\n-1\nper liter). A brief trial off nasogastric suction resulted in increased abdominal distention, with vomiting. The temperature rose to 39.8\u00b0C. Cultures of blood and urine were negative. On the ninth hospital day a consultant in infectious disease found that the abdomen was distended, with infrequent bowel sounds and a fluid wave; the edge of the liver descended 1.5 cm below the right costal margin; the spleen was not felt; a fullness was apparent in the epigastrium; no spasm or rebound tenderness was evident. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The white-cell count was 27,900, with 78 per cent neutrophils. Ampicillin was discontinued; gentamicin was continued, and cephalothin and ticarcillin were begun. X-ray films of the chest revealed that the lungs were clear but of low volume; a venous catheter terminated in the region of the right atrium, and a nasogastric tube extended to the level of the pylorus or proximal portion of the small bowel; abdominal distention was evident, but little bowel gas was seen.\nDuring the next two days the temperature fell to 38.1\u00b0C, but tachypnea and tachycardia developed and the abdominal distention increased. On the 12th hospital day another x-ray film of the chest was unchanged. Films of the paranasal sinuses revealed slight haziness in the area of the right maxillary sinus, believed due to soft-tissue swelling; no definite evidence of sinusitis was observed. A repeated ultrasound study of the upper abdomen showed apparent diminution of the ascitic fluid since the earlier study, although a large volume of fluid surrounded the liver; the pancreas was difficult to identify but appeared to be relatively hypoechoic; an echogenic area in the region of the ligamentum teres was believed to represent a dilated umbilical vein. Cephalothin was discontinued. On the following day the temperature rose to 38.5\u00b0C. On the 14th hospital day the child was irritable but did not seem toxic. The abdomen was distended, with diminished bowel sounds and evidence of ascitic fluid. The edge of the liver descended 4 cm below the right costal margin and was not tender; a firm, tender mass medial to the liver edge extended to the umbilicus. The hematocrit was 28 per cent; the white-cell count was 22,300, with 75 per cent neutrophils. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 64 mm per hour.\nOn the 15th hospital day the temperature rose to 38.7\u00b0C. Abdominal paracentesis yielded 55 ml of serosanguineous fluid that did not clot; the fluid contained 306,000 degenerating red cells and 1725 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 32 per cent were neutrophils, 4 per cent lymphocytes, 10 per cent monocytes, and 54 per cent nonhematic cells; the glucose was 107 mg per 100 ml (5.94 mmol per liter), and the protein 3.7 g per 100 ml; the amylase was 2380 IU per liter, and the lipase 550 U per milliliter. A culture was negative. On the next day the temperature rose to 40.5\u00b0C. Examination showed more distention of the abdomen. The hematocrit was 26.2 per cent; the white-cell count was 18,900, with 84 per cent neutrophils. An x-ray film of the chest was unchanged. All cultures remained negative. Amikacin, clindamycin, and cephalothin were given. On the 17th hospital day the temperature rose to 39.8\u00b0C. Transfusions of packed red cells were administered. On the next day the temperature rose to 39.1\u00b0C. The hematocrit was 29 per cent, and the white-cell count 14,000. The calcium was 8.5 mg per 100 ml (2.1 mmol per liter), and the phosphorus 5.1 mg per 100 ml (1.7 mmol per liter). The amylase was 310 U per milliliter, and the 5\u2032 nucleotidase 26.7 Bodansky U (2390 nmol. sec\n-1\nper liter). A\n111\nIn scan of the abdomen showed no evidence of an abscess or focal infection. During the next few days the temperature ranged between 38.3 and 38.9\u00b0C. All cultures remained negative.\nOn the 23d hospital day a diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Raphael H. Levey\\*: May we begin with a review of the x-ray films?Dr. Joseph F. Simeone: A film from an upper gastrointestinal series ([Fig. 1](#f001)) reveals an underfilled duodenum and a dilated stomach. The C loop of the duodenum is widened by a process that impresses the first and second portions as well as the gastric antrum. These findings indicate a mass in the head of the pancreas, and the presence of the mass is confirmed by the ultrasound study. A CT scan obtained at another hospital is technically inadequate for evaluation of the pancreas, but it does reveal an enlarged liver with fatty infiltration; the spleen is at the upper limit of normal in size, and ascites is evident. The echogenic area in the region of the ligamentum teres is presumably a dilated umbilical vein. There does not appear to be a mass within the left lobe of the liver. On an ultrasound study done at this hospital the head of the pancreas appears normal in size but edematous. Ascites is again demonstrated.Dr. Levey: This four-year-old girl with acute and chronic pancreatitis underwent a diagnostic procedure after a fairly long hospital course. The most important fact in the early history is the de novo development of a pancreatic pseudocyst at the age of 30 months. It was treated by internal drainage but recurred three months later and then resolved spontaneously. Before those episodes she was apparently well, and there was no antecedent history of trauma, which in our experience at the Children's Hospital Medical Center is the leading cause of pseudocyst formation in older children. Spontaneous resolution of such a cyst is fairly common, but in the absence of a story of blunt abdominal trauma our attention must be directed toward another cause in a patient of this age.At the outset it is prudent to exclude unusual causes. Parasitic diseases, such as echinococcus, *Clonorchis sinensis*, and ascaris infestations, have been associated with acute pancreatitis by producing obstruction within the pancreatic ductal system. It is of interest that a CT scan of the abdomen two days before entry revealed a thick-walled cystic structure with a central solid nidus, since that finding is consistent with a hydatid cyst, especially if it was situated, as suggested, in the left hepatic lobe. That location was not confirmed, however, and other diagnoses have to be considered.The importance of pancreatitis as a diagnostic consideration in childhood was emphasized by Hendren et al.[1](#core-r001) in 1965. Recent experience at the Children's Hospital Medical Center has indicated that acute pancreatitis is associated with a mortality rate of up to 30 per cent and should be considered in any child who presents with severe, acute upper abdominal pain. Chronic pancreatitis has usually been associated with hyperlipemia or cystic fibrosis, although mechanical factors may also be responsible for it.After a 15-month interval of good health acute pancreatitis recurred in this child and was associated with pancreatic ascites. Aspiration of the peritoneal cavity yielded fluid with an amylase content of 2380 IU per liter and a lipase content of 550 U per milliliter. These findings are pathognomonic of pancreatic ascites, which must be attributed to rupture of a pancreatic duct, leading to extravasation of pancreatic juices into the free peritoneal cavity with its associated physical manifestations. Once again, the findings point to some form of pancreatic-duct obstruction. In this patient the obstruction must have occurred without associated blockage of the common bile duct, since at no time in the hospital course were the chemical indexes consistent with bile stasis and icterus was never present.Conservative management did not lead to appreciable improvement in the child's condition. It is difficult to decide what diagnostic procedure was performed to elucidate the cause of the pancreatic ductal obstruction or to help in the treatment when the patient still had active disease, as indicated by the serum amylase level of 310 U per milliliter at that time. According to our experience, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic examination is contraindicated under these circumstances, since it may lead to a flare-up of the process. On the other hand, during a quiescent phase this procedure can be the most useful procedure available. It can not only outline the ductal system but may also demonstrate the point of leakage responsible for the ascites. A percutaneous needle biopsy of a palpable mass, even with ultrasonic guidance, would also have been very dangerous and would have been contraindicated, since it would probably have accentuated a pancreatic phlegmon if present. An arteriographic examination might have provided clearer visualization of the head of the pancreas, an area of critical concern in the light of the fact that an upper gastrointestinal series performed elsewhere 11 days before admission disclosed compression of the gastric antrum and duodenum by a mass in the head of the pancreas. Furthermore, the later ultrasound study of the pancreas continued to show a cystic structure apparently located in the pancreatic head. In our experience, however, an ultrasound study is not entirely reliable in this region. In view of the magnitude of the problem I am led to the conclusion that the diagnostic procedure was a laparotomy.It is appropriate at this time to consider the few structural abnormalities that can cause isolated cystic dilatation of the head of the pancreas with pancreatic-duct obstruction, acute recurrent pancreatitis, and pancreatic ascites in childhood. The possibilities include a pseudocyst, an abscess, and a tumor. My radiologic colleagues concluded that the findings in this case excluded the diagnosis of a choledochal cyst or some other congenital abnormality. I believe that exploration of the pancreatic ductal system was carriedout and that it was investigated by contrast studies at the operating table. In view of the presence of an ongoing inflammatory process I suspect that an extensive drainage of the pancreatic system was performed to alleviate what must have been partly related to chronic ductal obstruction.In conclusion, this patient had a pancreatic pseudocyst, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic ascites, and ductal obstruction, with or without an abscess or phlegmon. There may have been hepatic involvement, which certainly can result from extension of a pancreatic pseudocyst into the substance of the liver, although according to the studies available the cyst and the liver seemed to be separate.Dr. Ronald E. Kleinman: We believed that this girl had recurrent acute pancreatitis with pancreatic ascites, and that there was a possibility of a ductal abnormality of the pancreas, perhaps an internal pancreatic fistula.Dr. Donald N. Medearis, Jr.: What was the opinion of the infectious-disease consultants?Dr. Eugene J. Mark: They considered the possibility of a pancreatic or hepatic abscess.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. W. Hardy Hendren: We agree with Dr. Levey that an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic (ERCP) examination could have been helpful in this case to outline the anatomical features of the ductal system. In the face of continuing severe pancreatitis with ascites, however, we considered that procedure very risky, as he has pointed out. We observed the patient for three weeks, maintaining total parenteral alimentation and nasogastric suction in the hope that the pancreatitis would subside and allow us to do an ERCP study, but the ascites increased on this regimen. Therefore, we were forced to intervene surgically. Because we had experience with a similar case 20 years ago we thought that this patient probably had a congenital duodenal duplication in the head of the pancreas.[2](#core-r002) There was no reason to suspect trauma, the most common cause of pseudocysts in childhood.At laparotomy the abdomen contained fluid typical of that seen in a patient with pancreatitis; it was brown and murky, with a very high amylase content. Locules of fluid were present in front of and behind the left lobe of the liver, although no lesion was visible or palpable in the left hepatic lobe. The tail and body of the pancreas appeared normal except for surrounding inflammation. The porta hepatis was also free of involvement, but the head of the pancreas was stony hard, chronically inflamed, and swollen ([Fig. 2](#f002)). Since cystgastrostomy drainage had not been effective previously under these circumstances I concluded that the best course of action was to perform a Whipple operation ([Fig. 2](#f002)). This procedure might seem radical for a benign disease but was the safest and most conservative approach because it removed the diseased tissue, allowing us to join together relatively normal anatomical structures. A lesser operation would surely have left the patient with a continuing problem.In the resected specimen we found a small thickwalled cyst that contained multiple calculi. The cyst communicated with the pancreatic ductal system and probably would have filled during a pancreatographic examination if it had been safe to perform that study.The postoperative course was surprisingly uneventful, and the patient is well 20 months after the operation. A stomal ulcer develops in about 25 per cent of patients who have had a Whipple operation. I considered doing a vagotomy but decided against it because I did not want to prolong the operation in this sick child. If gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in the future we shall be prepared to do a vagotomy via a transthoracic approach.This child's clinical picture is remarkably like that of another child whom we saw 20 years ago, who presented with bloody ascites as an infant and underwent exploration. We later did a transduodenal exploration and a pancreatographic study, which showed a diverticulum-like structure connected to the pancreatic ducts. We misinterpreted the radiologic findings as due to extravasation of contrast medium into the head of the pancreas. We performed a transduodenal sphincterotomy. The child appeared improved for a time but returned eight years later with another attack of severe pancreatitis. We then performed a Whipple procedure. There was a lesion identical to that in this case \u2014 namely, a cystic lesion containing stones in the head of the pancreas. On histologic examination the cyst wall was lined by mucosa of duodenal type.In addition to these two children with intrapancreatic enteric duplications we have seen a third patient on whom Dr. Stephen E. Hedberg operated about 20 years ago. That child had a gastric duplication arising from an accessory lobe of the tail of the pancreas.[3](#core-r003) Also, Filston and his colleagues[4](#core-r004) have recently reported a case in which a pancreatographic study showed the same appearance as that in our first case. Since the pancreas originates as a bud evaginating from the duodenum it is not difficult to conceive how duodenal mucosa might be incorporated within this developing duct system.Dr. David L. Gang: The resected specimen consisted of the head of the pancreas, 7 cm of the gastric antrum, 5.5 cm of the duodenum, the gallbladder, and the distal extrahepatic bile ducts. Within the pancreatic head was a cyst, 3 cm in diameter, lined by heapedup, focally ulcerated pink-tan mucosa; the lumen contained several tiny black stones. The common bile duct and ampulla of Vater were normal. The main pancreatic duct was patent. No communication was identified between the cyst and the stomach on either gross or microscopical examination. The gallbladder and an additional piece of small bowel were normal.On microscopical examination the cyst was lined by a mixture of gastric-antral and duodenal types of mucosa with the submucosa containing Brunner's glands ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The muscularis propria was discontinuous and not present in all portions of the cyst wall. There was little inflammation in the cyst wall, but in the surrounding pancreatic head we found evidence of long-term chronic pancreatitis with intralobular and interlobular fibrosis, extensive adhesions between the cyst and the gastric wall, a plasma-cell infiltrate, and numerous hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Foci of peripancreatic fat necrosis were also observed. The inflammation was less severe in distal areas.The duodenal duplication cyst found in this case is part of a spectrum of duplications of the gastrointestinal tract that occur at all levels from the oral cavity to the anus. Duplications are spherical or tubular, are usually attached to some portion of the alimentary canal, and share various components of their wall with the adjacent bowel. They may hang free on their own mesentery and may or may not communicate with the bowel lumen. Duodenal duplications account for 4 to 12 per cent of all enteric duplications, and the duodenum is the third most common site after the ileum and the esophagus.[5,6](#core-r005) Five of 67 patients with enteric duplications in a series reported from the Children's Hospital Medical Center had duodenal lesions.[7](#core-r007) Most duodenal duplications present during infancy and childhood. Among the 54 cases reviewed by Inouye et al.[8](#core-r008) 18 patients were under the age of four months and 45 were less than 10 years of age; both sexes were equally represented. The duplications may be found along the first and second portions of the duodenum on the mesenteric side in either a submucosal or an intramuscular location. The frequent intimate association of the blood supply of the duplication and the duodenum may make surgical resection impossible. The lining of the duplication is usually duodenal in type but is gastric in 15 per cent of the cases, and peptic ulceration has been reported.[5](#core-r005) These cysts may also be lined by jejunal, ileal, or pancreatic epithelium, or the lining may be eroded with no epithelium remaining.The embryologic background of these lesions may be a failure of the bowel to recanalize during its solid epithelial stage between the eighth to 11th week of fetal development.[6](#core-r006) Another theory is that duplications result from a pinching off of duodenal tissue during the outgrowth of the pancreatic diverticulum.[2](#core-r002) Anomalies associated with duodenal duplications have included a double gallbladder, dislocation of the hip, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, ileal and gastric duplications, and mediastinal and esophageal cysts.[8](#core-r008)Dr. Hendren, do you know what was drained at the operation at the age of 30 months?Dr. Hendren: The surgeon opened the cyst in the head of the pancreas and anastomosed it to the antrum of the stomach, but that communication subsequently closed. A cyst-gastrostomy tends to close unless a very large window can be made between the two structures. That procedure was not possible in this case because the cyst was small. The patient described by Filston et al.[4](#core-r004) was treated by a Roux-en-y cyst-jejunostomy. The existence of our three proved cases of enterogenous cysts within the pancreas plus the fourth probable case of Filston et al. leads me to conclude that this disorder must be more common than we have supposed. If we look for it in young patients with recurrent pancreatitis perhaps we shall find more examples. If our colleagues who do pancreatic surgery in adults would do biopsies of nontraumatic pseudocysts some of them may prove to be enteric duplications.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Naana Afua Jumah\n(Student, Harvard Medical School): A 23-year-old woman was seen in the gynecology clinic of this hospital because of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion seen on pathological examination of a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear.\nFour weeks earlier, the patient had come to the adolescent and young adult medicine clinic of this hospital to establish care and to receive counseling regarding oral contraception, screening for sexually transmitted infections, and vaccination for the human papillomavirus (HPV).\nMenarche had occurred at the age of 13 years, and menses had been monthly and regular. She had been sexually active since the age of 21 and had had 18 male partners, most of whom had had other sexual partners, and she had no history of sexually transmitted infections or pelvic infections. She had used oral contraceptives for 3 months, when she first became sexually active, and reported consistent condom use for both contraception and protection against sexually transmitted infections, except on three occasions. Physical and gynecologic examination 20 months earlier had been normal; the Pap smear was normal, with endocervical cells present. Testing of cervical secretions for gonorrhea and chlamydia were negative. Five months later, a viral culture of a genital specimen and serologic tests for herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and type 2 IgG and IgM antibodies were reportedly negative. Three months before this evaluation, she had been seen in the emergency department of this hospital for a possible accidental overdose of acetaminophen, which she had been taking for dental pain. The blood acetaminophen level was 25.9 mg per liter (reference range, 10 to 25; toxic level, >120); the level 3 hours later was normal. She was instructed on proper dosing of the drug and discharged. She had had multiple atypical nevi, and one of two previous excisions had reportedly shown dysplastic changes. She had had an adenoidectomy at the age of 10 years. The patient worked in an office and lived with roommates. She had been without health insurance since graduating from college 1 year earlier. She drank 5 to 10 alcoholic beverages 2 to 3 days per week, including during sexual activity, and reported several episodes of blackouts while drinking; she had smoked marijuana on a few occasions in the past and did not smoke tobacco. Her mother had a history of vitiligo and alcohol abuse; her father and two sisters had irregular nevi. There was no family history of coagulopathy or gynecologic cancer. She was allergic to codeine. Her only medication was lorazepam, as needed for anxiety during airplane flights.\nOn examination, she appeared well. The vital signs were normal; the weight was 60.2 kg, the height 162 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.0. The tonsils were enlarged. There were multiple nevi on the trunk, arms, and legs (one over the right scapula was 3 mm in diameter with irregular borders, and one in the left inguinal region was 4 to 5 mm with color variation). Sexual development was Tanner stage 5 (fully mature), with normal external genitalia. The cervix was friable and tender to palpation; the uterus was midline, retroverted, and antiflexed; and the ovaries were normal. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory testing included a complete blood count; measurement of electrolyte and cholesterol levels; tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function; testing for syphilis and the human immunodeficiency virus; cervical screening for\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae\nand\nChlamydia trachomatis;\nand a liquid-based Pap smear. The patient was counseled about her level of alcohol consumption. The first dose of HPV vaccine was administered, and a prescription for oral contraceptives was written. Follow-up for the second vaccination in the series and for management of the oral contraceptives was scheduled. She was referred to the dermatology clinic.\nThe next week, review of the Pap smear revealed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. All other laboratory-test results were normal, and tests for infectious diseases were negative.\nThree weeks later, she was seen in the colposcopy clinic. The results of a pelvic examination were unchanged from the previous examination. Colposcopic examination, performed after application of 3% acetic acid, revealed the entire squamocolumnar junction with an area of aceto-white change with punctation between the 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions. A biopsy specimen of the lesion was obtained, and endocervical curettage was performed. Pathological examination revealed moderate-to-severe squamous dysplasia with koilocytosis. Review of the endocervical-curettage specimen revealed highly atypical glandular epithelium. Testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia was negative.\nFour weeks later, the patient was seen in the gynecology oncology clinic of this hospital. A diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Mark A. Goldstein:* On her first visit to our clinic, this young woman, who had had many sexual partners since becoming sexually active 2 years earlier, was found to have a high-grade intraepithelial lesion, a precursor of cervical cancer. This process is invariably associated with infection with certain types of HPV, estimated to be the most common sexually transmitted infection in 15-to-24-year-old persons in the United States. Infection is most frequent in sexually active women under the age of 25 years, like this patient.[1](#core-r001)\n### Risk Factors for HPV Infection\n\nAdolescents and young adults such as this patient are at higher risk for sexually transmitted infections, including HPV, than older persons, because of both behavioral and biologic factors. Young persons are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors, including unprotected intercourse, multiple sexual partners, and substance abuse in association with sexual acts, all of which this patient had done. In women, having sex during menses, having early coitarche, and being subject to coercive sex are also important risk factors; using alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or oral contraceptives and having a new partner, especially if he is known for less than 8 months before initiation of sexual activity, are predictive of an incident HPV infection.[2\u20135](#core-r002) This patient used oral contraceptives and acknowledged using alcohol and marijuana, including during sex. Other risk factors may include inadequate knowledge of the risks of sexually transmitted infections and lack of access to appropriate medical care; this patient had been without health insurance since leaving college.Biologic risk factors in young people include the more frequent presence of cervical ectopy and a larger transformation zone than in older women, inadequate production of cervical mucus, and increased susceptibility to trauma during intercourse. The presence of another sexually transmitted infection, such as vulvar warts or HSV infection, is an additional biologic risk factor for HPV infection in this age group.[3](#core-r003) This patient had cervical ectopy but did not have other sexually transmitted infections.Several studies have addressed the incidence of HPV infection in sexually active women in this patient's age group. The studies show cumulative incidences of HPV infection during periods of 12 to 24 months of about 40% among those who had vaginal intercourse[2,4,5](#core-r002); 50 to 80% of sexually active teenage girls and young women test positive for HPV.[6,7](#core-r006) Consistent use of condoms reduces but does not eliminate the risk of cervical and vulvovaginal HPV infection.[5](#core-r005) The risk is increased if the male partner has had multiple other partners or if his sexual history is not known.[8](#core-r008) This patient had multiple new sexual partners during a short time and reported that on at least three occasions she failed to use condoms. We can thus assume that she was at high risk for an incident HPV infection.Most HPV infections in female adolescents and young adults are transient and have little long-term clinical significance; 70% of women clear the infection within 1 year and more than 90% in 2 years.[2,3,7](#core-r002) Risk factors for persistent infection include infection with multiple strains, as well as immunocompromise.[9](#core-r009) Persistent infection is associated with abnormal cervical cytology, and more than 90% of patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions,[5](#core-r005) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, or adenocarcinoma in situ are positive for high-risk HPV.[10](#core-r010)Current guidelines recommend initiation of cervical-cancer screening within 3 years after first intercourse or by the age of 21 years, whichever occurs first. [11](#core-r011) Cervical screening may be performed earlier than stated in the guidelines if follow-up of the patient is unpredictable, the patient is immunocompromised, or there is concern that the patient may not have reported sexual abuse or sexual intercourse. This patient reported that her first vaginal sexual intercourse occurred when she was 21 years of age, and 7 months later she had her first Pap smear at her college health service. The specimen was adequate, endocervical cells were present, and it was negative for intraepithelial lesions and cancer. Her medical insurance lapsed, and she had no routine medical care after college graduation, resulting in a delay of cervical cytologic screening and of the initiation of the HPV vaccine. At the first visit to our clinic, 20 months after the initial negative cervical cytologic test, she reported multiple sexual partners and other high-risk sexual behaviors. The HPV vaccine was initiated, she was screened for sexually transmitted infections, and liquid-based cervical-cancer screening was performed in accordance with the published guidelines for adolescents and young adults ([Table 1](#t01)).[11\u201313](#core-r011)\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. David C. Wilbur:* A specimen from a liquid-based Pap test was obtained, and the slide was initially screened by a computerized scanning device, as is routine in the cytopathology laboratory at this hospital. The scanning device flagged the specimen as requiring manual review, which was performed by a cytotechnologist. Abnormal cells were identified, and the slide was then referred to the cytopathologist. The specimen contained a mixture of types of abnormal cells, ranging from those of a low-grade to those of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Koilocytes ([Figure 1A](#f01)), which are cells with the classic features of a productive viral infection, were indicative of the presence of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. These cells are representative of a transient infection with HPV. However, coexisting with the koilocytes were cells representative of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, which is a true neoplastic precursor lesion capable of progression to invasive carcinoma ([Figure 1B](#f01)). These cells are primitive in that they lack differentiation and have a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and a hyperchromatic nucleus with an irregular distribution of chromatin. The presence of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion typically correlates with the presence of severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ, known as grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 3) on biopsy specimens.\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Goldstein:* The patient's second cervical cytologic test, 2 1/4 years after her first intercourse, indicated the presence of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Although the majority of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions regress,[14](#core-r014) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions are likely to persist or progress, so that follow-up was indicated.[15](#core-r015) Tests for human immunodeficiency virus were negative, and we referred the patient for colposcopy in accordance with recent consensus guidelines.[16](#core-r016)*Dr. Annekathryn Goodman:* To determine the best treatment for this patient, an understanding of the natural history of cervical neoplasia is crucial. Persistent infection with HPV is strongly linked to the development of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, which this patient already has, as well as invasive cancer. Although the time of progression from persistent HPV infection to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions has been thought to be 5 to 15 years, on the basis of cross-sectional studies,[17](#core-r017) recent longitudinal studies of newly infected patients suggest that the interval may be much shorter, with cumulative 36-month progression rates to grade 2 or 3 CIN (CIN 2/3) from 7 to 20%, with the highest rates reported for HPV type 16 (HPV-16).[7,18\u201320](#core-r007) Thus, this patient's diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions within 2 years after becoming sexually active may not be as unusual as we might have thought.What is the likelihood that this patient's high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions will progress to invasive cancer? Invasive cervical cancer is rare in adolescents and young women aged 13 to 20 years[7,21](#core-r007); however, few data exist on the natural history of high-grade cervical lesions in adolescents. Two retrospective studies estimated a likelihood of progression from CIN 3 to invasive cancer ranging from 2 to 12%.[22,23](#core-r022) The median age of women with invasive cancer is typically 10 years higher than that of women with CIN 3.[7](#core-r007) Thus, although high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in adolescents and young women is unlikely to regress, it does not appear to progress rapidly to invasive cancer.The 2006 consensus guidelines recommend colposcopic evaluation of patients with high-grade Pap smears, along with biopsy and endocervical curettage.[16](#core-r016) Adolescents with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions are also immediately evaluated by colposcopy. Because of the low risk of invasive cancer in this population, diagnostic excisional procedures are avoided in adolescents, unless high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions persist for a total of 24 months.In this patient, I performed a colposcopic examination and applied acetic acid to distinguish normal from abnormal cervical epithelium and assess the extent of the high-grade dysplasia.[24](#core-r024) The normal, glycogenated epithelium, which has cells that have tiny nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, is not affected by this fixative, whereas dysplastic epithelial cells, which have larger nuclei and scant cytoplasm, become opaque and appear white (aceto-white) on examination. In this patient, a white area was evident, from which I took a biopsy specimen; I also performed an endocervical curettage.*Dr. Wilbur:* Colposcopic biopsy showed evidence of a high-grade squamous dysplasia, predominantly CIN 2 but with focal areas indicative of CIN 3 ([Figure 2A](#f02)). As predicted by examination of the cytologic specimen, evidence of a productive viral infection in the form of koilocytotic change was also noted ([Figure 2B](#f02)). In addition, the endocervical curettage revealed an area of atypical endocervical epithelium ([Figure 2C](#f02)). Although a number of endocervical reactive processes may have similar features, such changes raise the possibility of endocervical neoplasia and must therefore be further investigated. Adenocarcinoma in situ is also associated with HPV. It is rarer than squamous dysplasia but has increased in incidence during the past 20 years, most likely because of better detection but also perhaps in association with increasing use of hormonal contraception.*Dr. Goodman:* The consensus guidelines recommend excision or ablation of carcinoma in situ and adenocarcinoma in situ at all ages. In adolescents and young adults who have solitary CIN 3 lesions that are confined to the exocervix, observation every 6 months for up to 2 years is appropriate. A lesion that extends into the cervical canal, is multifocal, or contains adenocarcinoma in situ, as this one does, should be excised (there are no accepted nonsurgical therapies for adenocarcinoma in situ). Therefore, I performed a cervical loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) to excise the high-grade lesions involving both the exocervix and endocervix.*Dr. Wilbur:* The LEEP produced the following three specimens: portions of exocervix and endocervix and an endocervical curettage. All the disease identified was in the exocervical specimen. One CIN 3 lesion (equivalent to severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ) had an abnormality of maturation involving full or near full thickness ([Figure 3A](#f03)) and numerous mitoses in the upper levels of the epithelium. This process extended to the exocervical resection margin. In addition, multiple foci of endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ were present. In the lesion, pseudostratified epithelium abutted normal simple endocervical cells ([Figure 3B](#f03)). The initial endocervical curettage specimen did not show the pseudostratified epithelium with mitotic activity ([Figure 3C](#f03)). These changes are indicative of endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ, since no evidence of stromal invasion is noted in the specimen.In retrospect, the original cervical cytologic specimen showed very subtle changes suggestive of the presence of an endocervical lesion ([Figure 3D](#f03)). The Pap test was originally designed to detect the far more common squamous lesions, and its sensitivity for glandular lesions is generally thought to be less than 50%. Glandular lesions, which often reside high in the endocervical canal and deep in the endocervical crypts, may not produce cells for examination, and when they do, the features may be difficult to differentiate from squamous dysplasias and from reactive conditions.*Dr. Goodman:* The rate of treatment failure after LEEP ranges from 1 to 25% depending on the size of the lesion, whether it is multifocal, and whether the cervical margins are negative. The majority of recurrences occur within 2 years. In general, for a patient with an excision with negative margins, Pap smear and colposcopy are performed at 6-month intervals; after two normal Pap smears, the patient can return to routine screening. The consensus guidelines state that yearly screening after two consecutive repeat cytologic examinations are negative must be continued for 20 years.[16](#core-r016) In this patient, with positive exocervical resection margins and negative endocervical margins, I performed a repeat LEEP with endocervical curettage 3 months later; the specimen showed no evidence of dysplasia.*Dr. Marcela G. del Carmen:* This patient had received one dose of quadrivalent HPV vaccine before the diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Should she continue with the vaccination program? Two vaccines are currently available[25\u201328](#core-r025): a bivalent vaccine containing HPV-16 and HPV-18, which are associated with most cases of cervical cancer (approved in Europe and Australia and submitted to the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] for approval in the United States), and a quadrivalent vaccine containing HPV-6 and HPV-11 (associated with genital warts) and HPV-16 and HPV-18 (approved by the FDA for use in girls and women aged 9 to 26 years).[29](#core-r029) Both vaccines provided more than 90% protection against incident infection by the relevant HPV strains in clinical trials[30\u201332](#core-r030) and had more than 90% efficacy for prevention of CIN 2 or higher lesions in women who were HPV-negative at the end of the vaccination program.[33\u201336](#core-r033) The efficacy of the quadrivalent vaccine was assessed in subjects who were enrolled regardless of baseline HPV status. In the 21% of subjects who had evidence of infection with HPV-16 or HPV-18, the vaccine did not appear to alter the risk of the development of CIN.[34\u201336](#core-r034) Nonetheless, for this patient, the benefit of vaccination would include protection against the development of new HPV infection with other high-risk strains, as well as against genital warts.Although HPV vaccination will be important in the prevention of cervical cancer, it will not replace the continued need to participate in other preventive strategies, the most important of which may be continued cytologic screening for cervical cancer. In this patient, completion of vaccination with the quadrivalent vaccine would be appropriate, despite the likelihood that she is already infected with at least one of the four HPV types in the vaccine.*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): Dr. Goldstein, can you tell us what has happened to this patient?*Dr. Goldstein:* The patient completed the series of three HPV vaccinations. On repeat colposcopy 6 months after the second LEEP, there was no gross abnormality of the cervix. Pap smear and endocervical curettage disclosed atypical squamous cells; for this reason, HPV testing was performed, and it was negative for all the high-risk strains. She will follow up in 2 months in the gynecology clinic.*Dr. Goodman:* It is reassuring that, even though this patient had a clinically significant cervical lesion that was due to HPV infection, she eventually cleared the HPV infection. As long as she is sexually active, she can develop a new HPV infection that is not covered by the vaccine, so annual Pap smears are still essential. We do not know why a high-grade lesion developed in this patient, which occurs in less than 1% of all adolescent girls and young women.\n",

      "question": "A 50-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of a neurologic disorder.\nShe was well until 2 1/2 years earlier, when she sat down, heard a snapping sound and experienced the abrupt onset of low-back pain that was aggravated by walking and was excruciating when seated. Several times daily she had sharp, shooting pains that radiated down one or both legs to the toes. She stayed in bed for four weeks, with slight improvement. Six months later x-ray films and scans of the bones and lungs were reported to be normal. Fifteen months before admission she had an influenza-like episode, for which she was given an antibiotic. Diffuse weakness was present, and she began to lose weight. The shooting pains continued.\nTen months before entry a myelographic examination showed retrolisthesis of the fourth lumbar vertebra on the fifth, with indentation of the column of contrast material anteriorly. A laminectomy was performed, without benefit. She began to have a sensation of numbness and dull pain that extended from the neck into all the extremities and was relieved only when she was immobile; touching any part of this area resulted in a disagreeable, painful sensation. The shooting pains persisted from the knees to the toes and on three occasions radiated into the left side of the chest and down the left costal margin; weakness continued. Five months before admission repeated myelograms, an x-ray film of the chest and an upper gastrointestinal series were normal. She underwent psychiatric treatment and received 17 sessions of acupuncture, without improvement. Ten weeks before entry she began to have difficulty initiating micturition, with occasional dribbling incontinence and nocturia once or twice each night. There was intermittent pain in the flanks after voiding. Over the same interval her stools became soft and increased in frequency from one to three times daily. During the week before admission she was incontinent of stool on three occasions.\nFor several months she often awakened between 3 and 5 a.m., belched for several minutes and remained awake until morning. She experienced constant nausea and anorexia, with a decrease in her weight from 67 to 40 kg during the 15 months before admission. She took a multivitamin tablet daily. A hysterectomy had been performed 34 years earlier because of a carcinoma of the cervix. There was no history of chills, fever, headache, paresthesia, paralysis, inco-ordination, tremor or impairment of vision, hearing, swallowing, speech or mentation. She took no medication other than pentazocine and a multivitamin tablet and did not ingest alcohol.\nThe temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, and the respirations 16. With the patient in the supine position the pulse was 96, and the blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg; in the standing posture the pulse was 116, and the blood pressure 85/60 mm Hg.\nOn examination she was a gaunt woman with evidence of weight loss who appeared discouraged. The head and eyes, including the optic fundi, were normal. Shotty lymph nodes, 1 cm in diameter, were palpable in the cervical, axillary and left inguinal regions. The neck was supple. The lungs were clear. The heart was not enlarged; a Grade 2 systolic ejection murmur was heard along the lower left sternal border. The breasts, abdomen and extremities were normal. Rectal examination was negative; the sphincter tone was normal.\nNeurologic examination disclosed that she was alert, oriented and intelligent but slow of speech. Motor power was graded 7 on a scale of 10, but effort was judged suboptimal. Tone was diminished in all the extremities. Co-ordination was normal. The gait was slow and unsteady, with short steps on a 10-cm base; she often touched the wall for support. Sensory examination disclosed inconsistent changes, but pinprick sensation was assessed as probably normal on the face and probably impaired in the arms below the deltoid muscles and distal to the knees and to a lesser degree over the trunk. Light touch was normal. Thermal sensation was probably normal on the face, diminished from the level of the deltoid muscles to the knees and absent over the lower legs and feet. Vibratory and proprioceptive sensations were normal. Double sensory stimulation, graphesthesia, stereognosis and opticokinetic nystagmus were normal. The tendon reflexes were ++ in the upper extemities and absent in the lower extremities. The plantar responses were flexor; no Hoffman, grasp, glabellar, snout or jaw reflex was elicited. Examination of the cranial nerves was negative.\nThe urine gave a + + + + test for protein; the sediment contained 4 white cells and 5 red cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 36.3 per cent; the white-cell count was 13,200, with 77 per cent neutrophils, 18 per cent'lymphocytes and 5 per cent monocytes. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 20 mm per hour. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The urea nitrogen was 11 mg, the creatinine 0.5 mg, the fasting glucose 68 mg, the uric acid 5.2 mg, the calcium 8.9 mg, the phosphorus 4 mg, the bilirubin 0.3 mg, and the protein 6.4 g (the albumin 3.1 g, and the globulin 3.3 g) per 100 ml. The glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) was 35 U, the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 174 U, the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 15 U, the amylase 9 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 4.9 Bodansky U. Tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies were negative. An x-ray film of the chest was normal. In a 24-hour specimen of urine the creatinine was 645 mg, the protein 1.37 g, and the vanillyl-mandelic acid 1.84 mg. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless, acellular cerebrospinal fluid under an initial pressure of 85 mm; the glucose was 55 mg, and the protein 45 mg per 100 ml; the gold-sol curve was 0011100000; cytologic examination was negative for tumor cells, a serologic test for syphilis was negative, and a culture yielded no growth of micro-organisms. A culture of urine gave no bacterial growth. Serum immunoelectrophoresis disclosed a decrease in IgG and a marked, homogeneous increase in IgA; IgM was normal. Agarose-gel electrophoresis of the serum showed an M component in the beta-globulin region that was identified as the lambda type. A cystometrogram disclosed that the first sensation of bladder filling occurred at 400 ml, and the first desire to void at 500 ml; after 900 ml had been instilled the pressure rose to 19.5 cm of water; a voluntary effort at micturition at that point resulted in a pressure of 44 cm of water. An electromyographic examination demonstrated prolonged terminal latency and slow conduction velocity in the left median, tibial, peroneal and right tibial nerves, prolonged terminal latency in the right peroneal nerve, bilaterally absent sural sensory-evoked potentials, low amplitude and often prolonged sensoryevoked potentials in the hands, absent H reflexes bilaterally and prolonged late responses. The findings were interpreted as indicative of diffuse peripheral-nerve involvement and active denervation.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed on the fifth hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. James R. Lehrich\\*: This middle-aged woman's illness began acutely with low-back pain and pains radiating into both legs. The possibility of an acute herniated intervertebral disk or some other compressive lesion of the lumbar roots or cauda equinacomes to mind. However there was little improvement with bed rest, a myelographic study showed no evidence of an extradural defect, and she did not benefit from a laminectomy. We are not told what was found at that operation or whether there were any complications, such as excessive bleeding or infection, that might lead to extradural scarring or arachnoidal adhesions later. I assume that a lumbar myelographic study and lumbar laminectomy were the procedures performed. These negative data make one wonder whether the acute pain originated from bone disease, possibly a vertebral compression fracture, which might not be obvious radiographically, or from a spinal-cord lesion above the levels studied myelographically.This seems an appropriate time to review the x-ray films. I am especially interested in whether there is evidence of a spinal-cord or cauda-equina lesion, bone disease or organomegaly. Were levels higher than the lumbar region ever studied myelographically?Dr. Glenn H. Roberson: The two myelographic examinations demonstrate approximately the same findings. The films taken with contrast material in the lumbar subarachnoid space reveal no evidence of an intra-arachnoidal or extradural lesion. The highest level to which the contrast material flowed was the 12th thoracic vertebra, and the thoracic and cervical regions are not defined. There is no expansion of the conus, but the lower part of the cord is not shown. The other examinations, which were negative, include films of the chest. The axial skeleton is demineralized but no more than would be expected in a patient of this age. The films of the gastrointestinal tract are normal.Dr. Lehrich: The patient had a steadily progressive illness. Several symptoms suggest systemic disease \u2014 in particular, the diffuse weakness, weight loss, nausea and anorexia. We are informed that a carcinoma of the cervix had been removed 34 years earlier. Other symptoms suggest involvement of peripheral nerves or nerve roots or of the spinal cord. The shooting pains in the legs and in the left side of the chest and left costal margin may well have been neuropathic, although such pain could also be attributed to primary bone disease. The pain in the chest and costal margin might implicate the thoracic roots and cord. It is noteworthy in this regard that the myelographic contrast medium was not carried higher than the 12th thoracic vertebra. The numbness and dull pain extending from the neck into all the extremities, with accompanying hyperesthesia and dysesthesia, also implicate peripheral nerves, nerve roots or the spinal cord. The diffuse weakness could have developed on a neurologic basis or as a less specific manifestation of systemic disease. With the history of a back operation and previous myelographic examination one wonders about arachnoiditis, but the negative subsequent myelographic study is evidence against that diagnosis. Still other symptoms require an explanation. The difficulties with urination suggest urinary retention with overflow incontinence from a hypotonic bladder. This impression is supported by the findings on the cystometrogram. The gastrointestinal manifestations of soft stools, increased frequency of bowel movements and incontinence could have been neurogenic (caused by upper-motor-neuron, lower-motor-neuron or autonomic involvement) or could indicate an infiltrative or partially obstructive lesion of the bowel itself. The same considerations apply to the nocturnal belching, nausea and anorexia.The examination on admission showed signs of weight loss and lymphadenopathy, raising the question of a lymphoproliferative systemic illness. There was postural hypotension. The neurologic examination disclosed that the limbs were weak and hypotonic. Pain and temperature sensation was diminished, mainly distally in the arms and legs and to a lesser degree on the trunk, with normal touch, proprioception and vibration sensation. There was no definite sensory level on the trunk. The tendon reflexes were absent in the legs. The gait was unsteady, with normal co-ordination of the limbs. No signs of disordered pyramidal-tract or cranial-nerve function were found.Many of these findings are consistent with a peripheral neuropathy, affecting sensory fibers more severely than motor fibers and with principally a distal, symmetrical distribution. Pain and temperature sensory modalities, which are carried by small myelinated and unmyelinated axons, were chiefly affected. The patient's hyperesthesia and dysesthesia were of the sort often seen with small-fiber peripheral neuropathy, for reasons that are uncertain. The absence of tendon reflexes in the legs is also consistent with a peripheral neuropathy. Moreover, the results of the electromyographic and nerve-conduction studies provide firm evidence of disease of sensory and motor nerves in all the limbs. The electrophysiologic evidence of slowed conduction and active denervation suggests disease of myelin sheaths and axons. It is probable that the autonomic nervous system was also involved, accounting for the postural hypotension, the hypotonic bladder and perhaps also the bowel and gastroesophageal symptoms. We must keep in mind the possibility of primary disease of the gastrointestinal tract, such as esophageal moniliasis or amyloidosis of the bowel, however.Spinal-cord disease can mimic peripheral neuropathy and can present with distal paresthesia in the limbs and girdle pain similar to the pain in the chest and ribs described by this patient. These symptoms could have been caused by an intramedullary or compressive lesion of the cervical and upper thoracic cord. The absence of signs of corticospinal-tract involvement or of clear-cut segmental sensory loss and the normal cerebrospinal-fluid protein value argue against a compressive or intramedullary spinal-cord process but do not rule out such a lesion. The normal tone of the anal sphincter is evidence against a compressive lesion of sacral roots or conus, but higher spinal-cord disease could have been responsible for the bowel and bladder symptoms. The rapidity of onset of the bladder and bowel symptoms and the description of numbness and dull pain extending from the neck into all the extremities do suggest a spinal-cord lesion.The gait ataxia is difficult to explain. Some of the trouble with walking could have been a result of leg weakness. The proprioceptive sensation was grossly normal but might have been subtly impaired, enough to affect walking. It would be interesting in this regard to know whether a Romberg test was positive. Some aspects of the description of her gait suggest cerebellar ataxia, although patients with that disorder usually walk on a wider base. Since the limb co-ordination was normal one would have to postulate disease of the midline cerebellum, sparing the hemispheres. The gait ataxia of hydrocephalus might be considered, especially in an incontinent patient. I should also mention the Shy-Drager syndrome of idiopathic orthostatic hypotension, cerebellar gait ataxia, incontinence, signs of extrapyramidal disturbance and abnormal eye movements, in which there is pathological evidence of preganglionic disease of the autonomic nervous system. These diagnoses seem unlikely, however.In this case the clinical evidence points to disease of the peripheral nervous system, a subacute, symmetrical, sensorimotor and autonomic peripheral neuropathy affecting mainly small fibers. It is possible that a thoracic or cervical myelopathy of more recent onset was superimposed.I must now turn to the question of the cause. Clues are provided by some of the extensive laboratory data, particularly the serum immunoelectrophoretic findings of decreased IgG, a marked, homogeneous increase in IgA and normal IgM and the beta-globulin M component shown on the agarose-gel electrophoresis, which was probably IgA with lambda light chains. Thus, an IgA-lambda paraproteinemia was present.Although one would like to conclude that this woman had multiple myeloma, which is of the IgA-lambda type in about 5 per cent of the cases,[1](#core-r001) some diagnostic caution is indicated. We are not told the quantities of the immunoglobulins present, and if the IgA concentration was less than 1 g per 100 ml the patient could have had a benign monoclonal gammopathy of the sort found in a wide variety of pathologic conditions as well as in healthy old age. Moreover, she had only slight anemia and a normal sedimentation rate, which are unusual findings with multiple myeloma. However, I am encouraged in that diagnosis by the decreased IgG, the proteinuria and the mildly impaired renal function. We are not told if Bence-Jones protein was looked for or measured. With the total serum globulin level elevated, IgG decreased and IgM normal, we can assume that the IgA level was considerably elevated in this case. Furthermore, the early development of pain in the back, limbs and chest may have been a manifestation of involvement of bone by myeloma, which is responsible for the presenting complaint in most patients with this disease.[1](#core-r001) The vertebras, ribs and pelvis are usually the symptomatic bones, and the pain is often sudden in onset. Limb and girdle pain has also been described. The x-ray films may be normal in the early stages or may show only nonspecific osteoporosis, as was demonstrated in this patient.In recent years it has also been noted that so-called primary amyloidosis is associated in the majority of the cases with immunoglobulin abnormalities similar to those of the benign monoclonal gammopathies, and, of course, amyloidosis can be found with multiple myeloma. It has been reported to be present in 10 to 15 per cent of the cases of overt myeloma[2](#core-r002) and is frequently associated with lambda-light-chain and IgA myeloma.[3](#core-r003) Primary amyloidosis, with or without myeloma, is a difficult diagnosis to make on clinical grounds, but it certainly could have been present in this patient. Proteinuria is a common feature. Cardiac disease with electrocardiographic abnormalities, gastrointestinal symptoms due to direct infiltration with amyloid or to autonomic neuropathy and liver involvement, usually with normal results of liver-function tests, are also frequent findings. The sedimentation rate may be normal or elevated.Multiple myeloma itself can be accompanied by a variety of neurologic complications. Plasmacytomas may exert pressure directly on the spinal cord, nerve roots or cranial or peripheral nerves. Vertebral fractures may affect the cord or roots. There have been rare cases of myeloma in association with primary myopathy and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, but these seem only remote possibilities in this case.Two types of symmetrical peripheral neuropathy can occur with multiple myeloma, one without and the other with amyloidosis. Myeloma neuropathy without amyloidosis[4](#core-r004) is similar to the peripheral neuropathy described as a remote effect of a wide variety of neoplasms, most commonly lung carcinoma. It is a symmetrical, mixed sensorimotor neuropathy of gradual or subacute onset that affects the legs to a greater degree than the arms and is usually steadily progressive and painful. Neuropathic symptoms often precede the diagnosis, and the symptoms and signs of the systemic disease may be minimal at a time when the neuropathy is severe. Involvement of the autonomic nervous system is unusual. All the sensory modalities are generally affected with equal severity, and large nerve fibers tend to be more damaged than small fibers. The spinal-fluid protein level may be increased or normal. The results of nerve-conduction studies have been similar to the findings in this patient. The pathological examination has shown axonal degeneration with secondary segmental demyelination, sometimes with lymphocytic, but not plasma-cell, infiltration.[4](#core-r004) The patient under discussion could have had this form of myeloma neuropathy, but the bladder and bowel symptoms and orthostatic hypotension, which suggest autonomic involvement, and the selective involvement of pain and temperature sensation are atypical.The peripheral neuropathy of primary amyloidosis is much the same in sporadic cases as in cases in which it is associated with multiple myeloma.[5](#core-r005) Several forms of familial amyloid neuropathy have been described[6](#core-r006) but do not seem pertinent to this case. Sporadically occurring primary amyloid neuropathy is symmetrical, although it may be asymmetrical early in its course, affecting the distal portions of the limbs first and usually the legs before the arms. It involves sensory fibers earlier and to a greater degree than motor fibers and typically causes a selective loss of pain and temperature sensation, with preservation of proprioception and touch. Painless trophic ulcers may appear. Limb pain is often a major complaint. Symptoms and signs of autonomic neuropathy appear early and prominently, and urinary and bowel retention or incontinence, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption, abdominal distention and orthostatic hypotension, which may be the presenting symptom, are frequent manifestations. The bowel symptoms may also arise in part from direct infiltration with amyloid. The tendon reflexes may not be lost until late in the course. The spinal-fluid protein level may be normal or increased. A serum M component is usually present, whether or not multiple myeloma is present as well.[7](#core-r007) Pathological studies have shown predominant and early destruction of unmyelinated and small myelinated nerve fibers. Amyloid may be found in perineurial, endoneurial or neural blood vessels or as globular deposits or diffuse infiltrates in nerve fibers. Autonomic ganglions are also affected. The carpal-tunnel syndrome is a common feature as a result of mediannerve compression by local amyloid deposition in the wrist.Other types of peripheral neuropathy affect sensory, motor and autonomic function. Among them are those seen with diabetes mellitus, chronic alcoholism, the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and porphyria, but there is no evidence to point to any of those diagnoses in this case. A similar neuropathy can occur as a remote effect of neoplasms other than myeloma, and I cannot exclude an occult neoplasm in this patient or even a recurrence of the carcinoma of the cervix. A peripheral neuropathy has been reported in association with a monoclonal gammopathy and endocrine disturbances in Japanese patients.[8](#core-r008) There are also many patients, including some with an idiopathic autonomic neuropathy, in whom the cause of the peripheral neuropathy cannot be established despite extensive study.It seems most likely that this patient's peripheral neuropathy was a manifestation of amyloidosis, probably secondary to multiple myeloma, which also was the cause of the bone pain. However, I would not be surprised to learn that she had primary amyloidosis, with an associated plasma-cell dyscrasia but without true multiple myeloma, or multiple-myeloma neuropathy without amyloidosis. There may also have been amyloid involvement of the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract.This leaves the question of spinal-cord disease, for which the evidence is much less certain. The cord can be involved in paraneoplastic syndromes of several different types. One type affects the dorsal columns chiefly, another has prominent associated cerebellar degeneration, another is a poliomyelitis with striking anterior-horn-cell destruction and muscle weakness and atrophy, and still another is an acute, rapidly evolving necrotizing myelopathy, usually affecting the dorsal cord most severely. All these disorders seem improbable in this case. An intramedullary lesion of any sort would be expected to cause a more definite segmental sensory deficit than was observed in this patient, and there were no signs of corticospinal-tract dsyfunction, which are usually seen with either intramedullary or extramedullary cord disease. However, I cannot exclude cord compression, as by a plasmacytoma, superimposed on the patient's peripheral neuropathy and contributing to the limb weakness and numbness, the bladder and bowel symptoms and the left thoracic pain.The diagnostic procedure performed on the fifth hospital day may have been a biopsy of peripheral nerve, bone marrow or rectum or a complete myelographic examination. I suppose that either a sural-nerve or a bone-marrow biopsy was done.Dr. Edward R. Wolpow: Was an electromyographic examination done, and, if so, what did it show?Dr. Bhagwan T. Shahani: Electromyographic examination with concentric needle electrodes demonstrated evidence of widespread denervation in the muscles of both upper and lower extremities. Motor and sensory nerve conduction and late-response studies showed that the legs were more severely affected than the arms, and that the disease affected principally axons themselves rather than Schwann cells and myelin sheaths. The function of nerve fibers of large diameter in the arm was relatively well preserved, as indicated by preservation of sensory-nerve action potentials and relatively normal values for motor conduction and late-response latencies in the distribution of the ulnar and median nerves. In contrast, there was distinct slowing of motor conduction, with prolonged late-response latencies, in the small muscles of the foot, as well as absence of the H reflex and sural sensory-nerve action potentials. Conduction studies in vitro of the sural nerve removed at biopsy showed absence of A\u03b1, A\u03b4 and C potentials, suggesting that all types of nerve fibers, large and small, myelinated and unmyelinated, were severely affected in the legs.Dr. Raymond D. Adams: This patient was committed to my care, and we reasoned very much as Dr. Lehrich did, concluding that she had only a peripheral neuropathy and no sign of spinal-cord disease. We were intrigued by the autonomic aspect of the neuropathy. The autonomic neuropathies comprise a new chapter in neurologic medicine. Some occur in a relatively pure form, such as the Shy-Drager syndrome and another syndrome, which we have described, of pure preganglionic-postganglionic autonomic neuritis.[4](#core-r004) There is a second group in which the small fibers subserving pain and temperature and autonomic function are affected together. This disorder has frequently proved to be amyloid polyneuropathy of either the familial type or the type associated with myeloma. We were entirely in accord with Dr. Lehrich 's interpretations and conclusions.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Aisenberg, do you have any comment on this case?Dr. Alan C. Aisenberg: I see no alternative to the diagnosis of amyloidosis, with or without multiple myeloma. It seems probable that the M component was present in an amount usually associated with a plasma-cell neoplasm. With a normal total globulin and a decreased IgG the homogeneous IgA spike probably exceeded 1 g per 100 ml. The lymphadenopathy raises the question of lymphoma since amyloidosis is seen occasionally with Hodgkin's disease. However, one doesn't find an M component in association with Hodgkin's disease, and that diagnosis appears unlikely.Dr. Ernest H. Picard: Was the protein in the urine characterized?Dr. Adams: We looked for Bence-Jones protein but could not detect it.Dr. Scully: May we have the medical students' diagnoses?Mr. David D. Stark: We believed that a sural-nerve biopsy substantiated the diagnosis of primary amyloidosis. A bone-marrow biopsy would have been useful to rule out multiple myeloma and might have had prognostic and therapeutic importance.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The diagnostic procedure that was performed in this case was a sural-nerve biopsy, which showed very striking findings. All the sections of the nerve revealed multiple deposits of material typical of amyloid, both morphologically and tinctorially ([Fig. 1](#f001)). Many of these deposits were in the walls of small blood vessels, but small deposits could be seen in the endoneurial connective tissue as well ([Fig. 2](#f002)). There was considerable loss of fibers in the peripheral nerve, but principally of the small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers ([Fig. 3](#f003)).Dr. John C. Long: A bone-marrow aspiration done on the same day as the nerve biopsy revealed slight hypercellularity and 25 per cent plasma cells. On the basis of the serum immunoglobulin abnormalities, bone-marrow findings and nerve biopsy a diagnosis of plasma-cell myeloma with amyloidosis was made. A roentgenographic bone survey, done after the biopsies, revealed a lytic lesion in the left proximal femur. Despite therapy with prednisone and melphalan the patient died three weeks later.The post-mortem examination disclosed widespread amyloidosis. The spleen weighed 200 g and was firm and pale, and on microscopical examination the malpighian corpuscles and red pulp were replaced by amyloid deposits. A Congo-red stain was positive for amyloid, and when the tissue was examined with polarized light green birefringence was observed. Amyloid deposits were also detected within vessels in the kidneys, liver, heart ([Fig. 4](#f004)) and lymph nodes as well as within the interstitium of the lungs. There was prominent amyloid deposition in the stomach and small intestine, with intramural vascular deposits and linear involvement along the lamina propria. This lesion may have been responsible for the gastrointestinal symptoms.Sections from multiple bones obtained at autopsy revealed an infiltrate of plasma cells similar to that observed in the aspirated specimen ([Fig. 5](#f005)). Post-morterm smears of the marrow were examined by immunofluorescence for the presence of intracellular immunoglobulin by Dr. Helen Fraser, of our laboratory. Brilliant staining of the cytoplasm of the plasma cells was observed with fluorescein-conjugated antiserum to the IgA heavy chain and the lambda light chain of immunoglobulin ([Fig. 5](#f005)). No staining was observed in the presence of fluoresceinated antiserum to IgG and IgM heavy chains and kappa light chain. These post-mortem immunofluorescence studies confirmed the presence of an immunoglobulin of single heavy-chain class and light-chain type within plasma cells similar to that demonstrated by immunoelectrophoresis of the serum. There was no evidence of extramedullary involvement by myeloma at autopsy. An incidental finding was a small, peripherally located, well differentiated adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe of the lung.Dr. Wallace F. Buttrick: Were the kidneys not involved? Is that why no protein was found in the urine?Dr. Long: There was amyloidosis of the kidneys, with prominent vascular involvement, but the glomeruli were spared.Dr. Adams: In the original series of cases of multiple myeloma with polyneuropathy we searched hard for amyloid deposition but could not demonstrate it in the nerves.[4](#core-r004) That was a disappointment because we had fully expected to find it. In the cases in which amyloid has been present in nerves it isn't clear how it has altered nerve function and structure. Some observers have said that infiltration of the small vessels impairs the circulation, but deposits in the endoneurial connective tissue might exert a compressive effect.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Christopher J. Moran\n(Pediatric Gastroenterology): A 19-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent pancreatitis.\nThe patient had been well until approximately 6 months earlier, when lethargy and epigastric pain developed, associated with a dry throat, subjective fever, and frontal headache, which were relieved by acetaminophen. He went to a clinic for evaluation. He reported that 3 days earlier he had consumed six alcoholic beverages in one sitting (0.7 to 1.0 liters of vodka and two beers). On examination, the blood pressure was reportedly 140/100 mm Hg. A rapid screening test for streptococcus was positive. Penicillin and an antacid were prescribed, without improvement in the pain. Two days after the onset of pain, the patient saw his pediatrician. On examination, the blood pressure was 142/100 to 152/100 mm Hg. A monospot test was negative. The epigastric pain decreased slightly, and pain in the flanks and back developed. He returned to his pediatrician; laboratory-test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen reportedly showed fat stranding and inflammation of the pancreas, features consistent with pancreatitis, with a normal gallbladder and no evidence of dilatation or obstruction of the biliary tree. He was transferred to this hospital.\nThe patient reported constant epigastric pain, which he rated at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain intermittently increased in intensity and changed location with positioning. The patient had had constipation, difficulty sleeping because of the pain, decreased appetite, and during the previous week, weight loss of approximately 4.5 kg, without nausea, vomiting, or hematuria. His symptoms were not relieved by the administration of antacids, acetaminophen, lansoprazole, psyllium fiber supplement, polyethylene glycol, or defecation. The temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 139 to 162 mm Hg systolic and 77 to 90 mm Hg diastolic, and the pulse 96 beats per minute; the respiratory rate was normal, and the oxygen saturation was 95% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 142.2 kg, the height 188 cm, and the body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 40 (>97th percentile). The posterior oropharynx was erythematous, with moist mucous membranes; there was white plaque on the tongue. The abdomen was soft, with decreased bowel sounds, tenderness to deep palpation in the epigastrium, and slight guarding; there was no distention or rebound. There was tenderness in the midback and no tenderness at the costovertebral angle. The skin was diffusely flushed on the cheeks, extremities, and trunk. The red-cell indexes and platelet count were normal, as were tests of renal function and measurements of electrolytes, glucose, phosphorus, calcium, protein, albumin, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Urinalysis revealed 1+ ketones and bilirubin and trace urobilinogen.\nThe patient was admitted to this hospital. Intravenous fluids, narcotic analgesia, and omeprazole were administered, with improvement. Initial restriction of oral intake was followed by a gradually increasing diet. He was discharged on the fifth day on a low-fat diet and referred to the Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine for primary care, blood-pressure monitoring, a weight-loss program, and a discussion about high-risk behaviors, including binge drinking. At follow-up, results of thyroid-function tests were normal and testing for hepatitis B and C viruses was negative; other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nThe patient abstained from alcohol for 3 months and then began to drink socially again. Two weeks later, severe abdominal pain recurred, with radiation to the back and decreased appetite. On the fifth day of symptoms, he was readmitted to this hospital. On examination, the blood pressure was 142/98 mm Hg; other vital signs were normal. There were abdominal striae, decreased bowel sounds, a palpable liver edge, and mild tenderness to deep palpation in the epigastrium; the remainder of the examination was normal. The prothrombin time was 14.4 seconds (reference range, 10.3 to 13.2); other tests of coagulation and renal function were normal, as were measurements of electrolytes, glucose, protein, albumin, globulin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and aspartate aminotransferase. Other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Results of an abdominal ultrasound examination were normal. Intravenous fluids and morphine were administered, with improvement. The patient was discharged on the fourth day.\nAt follow-up visits in the Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine Division during the next 6 weeks, the patient felt well and the blood pressure was normal; test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. During the next 5 weeks, he consumed one or two alcoholic beverages approximately twice a week. Three days before this admission, abdominal pain (rated at up to 9 on a scale of 0 to 10) recurred that was associated with nausea, decreased appetite, clamminess, and light-headedness. He was readmitted to this hospital.\nThe patient had received all routine immunizations and had been well. He was a college student and lived in an apartment with other students when not living with his parents and sibling. He smoked one or two cigarettes weekly and reported no use of illicit drugs. His girlfriend had recently had infectious mononucleosis. His father had high cholesterol, his maternal grandfather had coronary artery disease, his maternal grandmother had throat cancer, and other maternal relatives had type 1 diabetes mellitus and gallstones; paternal and maternal family members reportedly had alcoholism.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 160/93 mm Hg and the weight 133.5 kg; other vital signs and the oxygen saturation were normal. There were decreased bowel sounds, pain in the upper quadrants that radiated to the back and occurred at rest and with palpation, and no distention or rebound. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis revealed clear, amber urine with 1+ bilirubin, 2+ ketones, and trace albumin and urobilinogen; it was otherwise normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mild splenomegaly (14 cm). Intravenous fluids, ranitidine, and narcotic analgesics were administered, with symptomatic improvement. On the second day, tests for heterophile antibody and antibodies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) were negative; T-lymphocyte subsets were normal.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen after the administration of gadolinium and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed a normal pancreas and pancreatic duct. The common bile duct was normal, with no calculi.\nA diagnostic test was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Uzma Shah:* When he was 19 years of age, this previously well young man began to have recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, with laboratory evidence of acute pancreatitis, that required repeated hospitalizations.\n### Causes of Recurrent Acute Pancreatitis\n\nWhen acute episodes of pancreatitis occur repeatedly, as they have in this patient, the condition is described as recurrent acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is much less common in children and adolescents than in adults, and the causes differ between the two groups.[1](#core-r001) It is important to determine the cause in this patient and treat it, since recurrent acute pancreatitis may result in injury to the pancreatic duct and progressive inflammation and scarring of the duct, leading to chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis may result in exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. In this case, I would first investigate the most common causes of acute and chronic pancreatitis ([Table 2](#t02)).[2,3](#core-r002)\n### Structural Abnormalities\n\nOne of the most common causes of acute pancreatitis is obstruction of the pancreatobiliary tree.[2\u20136](#core-r002) It is important to rule out gallstones, structural anomalies of the duct, and cysts. Although 40% of episodes of acute pancreatitis in adults are caused by gallstones, pancreatitis developed in only 4% of 382 children with gallstones in one study.[7](#core-r007) It would nonetheless be important to consider a diagnosis of gallstones in this adolescent, in view of the high BMI and family history of elevated cholesterol levels and cholelithiasis.Other, rarer structural anomalies that should be considered include pancreas divisum, choledochal cysts, annular pancreas, and dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi.[7,8](#core-r007) In this case, the first imaging study was CT, performed at another facility, rather than ultrasonography, which is preferred. On the CT scan, the gallbladder appeared normal, with no evidence of biliary-duct dilatation or obstruction. MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) would allow better examination of the biliary tree for evidence of pancreas divisum.[9](#core-r009)May we review the imaging studies?*Dr. Anuradha S. Shenoy-Bhangle:* Ultrasound examination of the abdomen was the first study performed at this hospital. In pediatric patients with pancreatitis, our initial screening tool is ultrasonography.[10,11](#core-r010) It is a noninvasive bedside procedure, involves no radiation, and is the best imaging method for seeing gallstones. Biliary obstruction and choledochal cysts are also evident. The disadvantage is poor visualization of the pancreas and pancreatic ductal anatomy, so that congenital anomalies such as pancreas divisum or annular pancreas, which are the most common causes of pediatric pancreatitis, are not shown well. In this case, ultrasonography revealed an absence of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, ascites, or loculated fluid collections in the abdomen. The pancreas was obscured by bowel gas and thus was poorly visualized. There was borderline splenomegaly and no imaging evidence of portal hypertension.After recurrent episodes of pancreatitis, secretin-enhanced MRCP and MRI of the abdomen were performed. At this hospital, we find that MRCP is the best method for assessing pancreatic ductal anatomy and congenital anomalies of the pancreaticobiliary system. It is noninvasive (in contrast to ERCP), does not involve radiation, and can reveal congenital anomalies and cysts. Secretin can be administered to distend the pancreatic duct, allowing better visualization of the ductal anatomy and quantification of pancreatic exocrine function.[12](#core-r012) A disadvantage of MRI in young children is that sedation or anesthesia may be required. We do not use CT as a primary diagnostic tool for acute pancreatitis; it is reserved for diagnostic mysteries or the evaluation of complications. In this case, MRCP revealed a single, normal-size pancreatic duct, with no evidence of pancreas divisum or annular pancreas ([Figure 1](#f01)). The duct distended normally in response to the administration of secretin and reverted back to normal size within 10 minutes after administration. The common bile duct was normal and had no calculi in it. There was no pancreatic parenchymal necrosis.*Dr. Shah:* Structural and obstructive causes of the patient's pancreatitis are ruled out by these studies.\n### Metabolic Causes\n\nThis patient had a high BMI and had been hypertensive on many occasions. Although hypertension may be a clinical manifestation of acute pancreatitis and pain, it was unclear whether the patient had had hypertension before these episodes. Because of his high BMI, a metabolic disease should be considered. His family history included hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and gallstones. Metabolic causes of chronic pancreatitis include hyperlipidemias (due to lipoprotein lipase deficiency and apolipoprotein C2 deficiency) and less common causes, such as defective transport of amino acids. Hypertriglyceridemia in particular may be a risk factor for acute pancreatitis in patients who have some genetic mutations that increase the risk of pancreatitis.[13](#core-r013) This patient's lipid profile, blood chemical profile, and thyroid screening were normal.\n### Toxins\n\nAlthough there is a long list of drugs that lead to pancreatitis, the most common are anticonvulsant agents, chemotherapy agents for the treatment of cancer, and diuretics. This patient received penicillin during the first episode of pancreatitis. This antibiotic has been associated with pancreatitis but would be unlikely to cause recurrent episodes. Drug-induced injury was unlikely to have been the cause of his symptoms.\n### Infection\n\nThe patient was febrile and had an elevated white-cell count during the episodes of pancreatitis; therefore, infectious causes should be considered. He had intermittent mild elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase levels. Although a rapid streptococcal screen was positive on his initial presentation, tests for other infectious agents associated with acute pancreatitis (e.g., EBV) and tests for infectious agents associated with recurrent inflammation (e.g., hepatitis B and C viruses and the human immunodeficiency virus) were negative. His girlfriend reportedly had had infectious mononucleosis, but repeat testing of the patient for acute EBV infection was negative. An infectious cause for his pancreatitis seemed unlikely.\n### Systemic Diseases\n\nOn ultrasound examination, mild splenomegaly was identified. Splenomegaly is occasionally seen during episodes of pancreatitis, but it may be a clinical feature of systemic autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Therefore, an evaluation for autoimmune pancreatitis was indicated, including measurement of serum IgG4, antinuclear antibody, and rheumatoid factor.[14](#core-r014) The patient's IgG4 level was normal, and there was no evidence of beading of the biliary duct on imaging, as would be seen with sclerosing cholangitis.\n### Genetic Causes\n\nAn alcohol binge preceded the first episode of acute pancreatitis in this patient. In adults, alcohol accounts for 35 to 40% of all cases of acute pancreatitis; in children, this would be unusual.[4](#core-r004) However, alcohol is a trigger for pancreatitis in children with an underlying genetic or metabolic predisposition. Genetic mutations are an important cause of recurrent and chronic pancreatitis in pediatric patients ([Table 2](#t02)), and the episodes of pancreatitis are frequently triggered by hyperlipidemia or, as in this patient, alcohol consumption.[13,15,16](#core-r013) Among children with chronic pancreatitis, 30% of cases are considered to be idiopathic, possibly because of mutations that have not yet been identified.[2](#core-r002) Identifying a genetic mutation in this patient would have important implications for his future, since mutations are associated with an increased risk of the development of pancreatic insufficiency and pancreatic cancer.[17\u201319](#core-r017)How could a genetic abnormality cause the recurrent episodes of pancreatitis in this patient? In the pancreas, there is a delicate balance between trypsinogen and its activated form, trypsin ([Figure 2](#f02)).[16](#core-r016) Uncontrolled action of trypsin causes inflammation and pancreatitis. Genetic factors can influence this balance. Cationic trypsinogen (encoded by *PRSS1*), a high calcium level, and a low pH promote activation of trypsinogen to trypsin. Calcium levels are regulated in part by the calcium-sensing receptor (encoded by *CASR*) and dysregulated by ethanol. Trypsin is removed both by degradation and by excretion via the pancreatic duct. Degradation is facilitated by chymotrypsin C (encoded by *CTRC*), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (encoded by *CFTR*) functions to eliminate trypsin by flushing the pancreatic duct. If inflammation occurs, it leads to up-regulation of expression of the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (encoded by *SPINK1*), which blocks trypsin, prevents further activation of trypsinogen, and limits further tissue injury.\n#### PRSS1\n\nGain-of-function mutations in the *PRSS1* (serine protease 1) gene are the most common cause of autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis. These mutations lead to increased trypsin in the cells, which promotes inflammation.[17\u201319](#core-r017) A diagnosis is made in adolescence in most patients. Alcohol, smoking, and dietary fat are triggers for inflammation.\n#### SPINK1\n\nMutations in *SPINK1,* also called the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor gene, confer an increased risk of pancreatitis due to an inability of the pancreatic acinar cells to inhibit intracellular trypsin. A combination of genetic and environmental factors influences the development of pancreatitis. In several series,[17\u201319](#core-r017) 16 to 23% of previously \u201cidiopathic\u201d cases of pancreatitis were due to *SPINK1* mutations. The N34S mutation, in particular, has frequently been associated with pancreatitis.[20](#core-r020)\n#### CFTR\n\nMutations in the *CFTR* gene, inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, are an important cause of chronic pancreatitis. Several studies have shown that *CFTR* mutations, including uncommon or mild mutations, may be identified in patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis, suggesting that additional genetic or environmental disease modifiers may be present.[21,22](#core-r021) Four subtypes of *CFTR* mutations have been proposed as causes of chronic pancreatitis. Type 1 is associated with two severe mutations and is the classical form of cystic fibrosis. In type 2, which has variable severity, one allele has a severe mutation and one has a mild mutation. Type 3 is characterized by *CTFR* mutations that are similar to those seen in type 2, but with an additional mutation in a susceptibility gene such as *SPINK1*; and type 4 has a heterozygous *CFTR* mutation with a strong environmental trigger factor, such as alcohol.\n#### CTRC\n\nCTRC destroys activated trypsin. *CTRC* mutations, in particular the R254W mutation, have been identified in pancreatitis.[23](#core-r023)\n### Summary\n\nThe recurrent theme in this case is alcohol exposure followed by pancreatic inflammation. I think the most probable cause of recurrent pancreatitis in this adolescent, in view of his history and the absence of structural or obstructive lesions, infectious agents, or other metabolic disease, is an underlying genetic mutation. The alcohol probably triggered these episodes of pancreatitis. I would recommend testing for mutations in *PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR,* and *CTRC*. The patient will also require aggressive management of his high-risk behavior (i.e., his alcohol and tobacco use) and will need to address his overweight status.\n\nDiagnostic Testing\n------------------\n\n*Dr. Moran:* The diagnostic test was screening for genetic mutations associated with pancreatitis. The patient was found to have two *CFTR* mutations \u2014 \u0394F508 and R31C. The \u0394F508 mutation carries the more severe phenotype. A sweat test was equivocal. Genetic testing of the patient's parents showed that both parents were carriers, a finding that was consistent with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in the patient. In addition, the patient had a *SPINK1* mutation. The *PRSS1* gene was normal. The final diagnosis was recurrent pancreatitis due to mutations in the *CFTR* and *SPINK1* genes, triggered by alcohol consumption.*Dr. Shah:* It is important to note that a patient with a *CFTR* mutation may have a normal sweat test, because the mutations that affect the pancreas affect the acinar cells, not the sweat glands. This patient has compound heterozygosity for the *CTFR* mutation, as well as a mutation in the susceptibility gene *SPINK1,* so he can be considered to have a type 3 *CFTR* mutation.\n\nManagement and Follow-up\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Moran:* The patient recovered uneventfully from this episode of acute pancreatitis and was discharged on the fourth day.The patient was counseled on his very strong genetic predisposition for pancreatitis (500 times that of the general population) and the potential for the development of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, diabetes, and pancreatic cancer. He is at particular risk for diabetes owing to pancreatic insufficiency from recurrent pancreatitis and insulin resistance due to his weight. He was counseled on weight loss and on the need to minimize all factors that could contribute to pancreatitis (e.g., alcohol consumption and smoking), which can increase his risk for pancreatic cancer.In order to rule out a contribution of dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi, we recommended obtaining an ERCP, despite the risk that performing ERCP could trigger another episode of pancreatitis. The ERCP showed no evidence of an anatomical abnormality that could contribute to the patient's recurrent pancreatitis, and there were no signs of chronic pancreatitis. Nevertheless, a sphincterotomy was performed, with stent placement; this was complicated by a brief episode of pancreatitis.The patient was referred to Dr. Mary Shannon Fracchia at the pediatric pulmonary service for evaluation for pulmonary involvement due to cystic fibrosis. He had no history of sinus or pulmonary infections or symptoms, and the results of pulmonary-function tests were normal. Dr. Fracchia recommended beginning treatment with oral pancrelipase.The patient and his family have been carefully and repeatedly counseled about the implications of recurrent pancreatitis and the need to address the triggering factors. He and his family have heard a consistent message, that alcohol intake is going to affect his long-term health. Each episode of pancreatitis carries a risk of death, and the additive effect of recurrent pancreatitis increases his risks of diabetes and pancreatic cancer.We offered a referral to the weight center, but the patient did not follow up with this referral. He has quit smoking tobacco. We continue to counsel him that the most important step toward avoiding future episodes of pancreatitis is alcohol abstinence. He has stopped binge drinking but has refused to stop drinking altogether and has declined referral to counseling. Two years after the diagnosis, he continues to be readmitted approximately every 6 months for acute pancreatitis.*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): Dr. Goldstein, you cared for this patient. Would you like to comment?*Dr. Mark A. Goldstein* (Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine): I saw this patient recently for another episode of acute pancreatitis. He reported a 2-day history of right-upper-quadrant pain that radiated to his back. He reported no intake of alcohol in the preceding 24 hours. After the pain began, he modified his diet to clear liquids only and placed himself on bed rest. On examination, his weight had increased to 150.8 kg, and the BMI had increased to 43.3. There was upper abdominal tenderness. The serum amylase level was moderately elevated, at 121 U per deciliter, and the lipase level was elevated, at 131 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60). The patient declined to be admitted to the hospital. Together with the pediatric gastroenterology service, we developed a plan to treat him as an outpatient with narcotic analgesic tablets and a clear liquid diet. Several days later at a follow-up examination, he reported no pain, and the amylase level was normal.*Dr. Harris:* What is the likelihood of the development of pancreatic insufficiency if the patient doesn't stop drinking altogether?*Dr. Shah:* In hereditary pancreatitis, pancreatic insufficiency may develop in 35 to 45% of patients.[17,24](#core-r017) The risk depends on the number of episodes of pancreatitis and is likely to be accelerated if the patient continues to drink alcohol.*A Physician:* Although there is a sense of satisfaction at having determined the cause of his pancreatitis, it is very unfortunate that we have been unable to persuade this young man to accept the only measure that might help him \u2014 cessation of alcohol consumption.\n",

      "question": "A 67-year-old right-handed man was referred to the hospital because of aphasia and memory loss.\nThe patient was well until 18 months earlier, when he began to have progressive difficulty in speaking and writing. During approximately the next nine months his communication skills gradually worsened to the point that he retired from the practice of law; he made no major professional errors, but he had made a substantial error in completing his own most recent income-tax return.\nEighteen months later the patient was first seen at this hospital. He had pursued his hobbies of golfing, bowling, photography, and watching televised sporting events; he still read magazines and wrote letters; he was fully independent in acts of daily living, and his personality was considered intact by his wife. He had been struck on the head by a golf ball 20 years earlier, with loss of consciousness for approximately one minute; there were no known sequelae. During the year or two before retirement he had consumed two or three cocktails nightly before dinner, but his wife reported that he was never intoxicated; in recent months he had reduced his intake of alcohol to one glass of wine nightly. He had used diazepam intermittently in unknown doses for palpitations of long standing but took no other medications and had no history of organic cardiac disease or chronic medical or psychiatric illness. His father died with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 77 years, 5 years after loss of memory, and a brother died with the same diagnosis at 59 years, 2 years after loss of memory; no autopsy was performed in either case. The patient's mother died at 96 years of age, without dementia; two sisters 61 and 60 years of age were well, as were six adult children.\nOn physical examination the pulse was 68 and the blood pressure 140/85 mm Hg; the weight was 83.5 kg. The patient appeared well. No carotid bruits were found. There was a moderately severe receptive and expressive aphasia; the patient could not name a belt or a belt buckle; he did name a pen correctly after perseverating on \"pencil\" for 15 seconds and accurately named a wristwatch and eyeglasses without hesitation. He perseverated in saluting when asked to wave \"goodbye\" but performed other gestures on command and in mimicry. His speech was fluent but often rambling and filled with circumlocution; there were numerous intrusion errors in which words and concepts entered inappropriately into current discussions. The content of his speech was often tangential and failed to relate to the topic under discussion. Cranial-nerve functions were intact; prominent suck and snout reflexes were present, without other abnormal reflexes. No focal abnormalities were detected on the remainder of a thorough neurologic examination.\nThe Blessed Dementia Scale score was 17.5; a score of 0 to 2 errors is normal, and the maximal score for dementia is 67. The Hachinski score was 1, indicating the absence of risk factors for stroke. The Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score indicated 20 percent impairment (a score of 0 percent denotes full independence, and 100 percent signifies complete dependence on others). A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the cranium, performed elsewhere 13 months earlier, was reported to show anterior cerebral cortical atrophy out of proportion to posterior atrophy, with the left side more severely affected than the right side. A single-photon\u2014emission computed tomographic examination (SPECT), performed three months later, was said to reveal bilateral cortical perfusion deficits in the parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes. An electroencephalographic examination six months before the visit was negative.\nAt a follow-up visit five months later the patient's wife reported that he had increasing difficulty in comprehending her speech. He continued to play golf and to participate in activities around the house; he still drove an automobile in the neighborhood, without incident. His wife believed that he was more irritable and less sensitive to the feelings of others than in the past. The Blessed Dementia Scale score was 22. Another cranial CT scan, performed without the intravenous injection of contrast material, disclosed that the lateral and third ventricles were moderately enlarged because of central atrophic changes; there was a slightly ballooned contour of the tips of the frontal horns, without evidence of white-matter angiopathy; the cerebral sulci were widened bilaterally, and the spaces between the frontal lobes and the sylvian fissures were greatly widened; considerable space due to peripheral atrophy was evident around the brain stem; there was a moderate amount of calcification in the walls of the basilar and carotid arteries.\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain (\nFig. 1\nand\n2\n) showed moderate enlargement of the ventricles and subarachnoid spaces, with prominence of the anterior interhemispheric fissure; there was a nonspecific increase in T\n2\n-weighted signal in a periventricular distribution; a small nonspecific focus of increased T\n2\nsignal was also observed in the deep white matter of the right posterior frontal region, consistent with a perivascular space; no other areas with structural or signal abnormality were detected. A lumbar puncture performed several months later yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid that contained 28 red cells and no white cells per cubic millimeter; the glucose was 3.7 mmol per liter (66 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 55 g per liter (5.5 g per 100 ml).\nThe patient's irritability worsened, with intermittent belligerence. Thioridazine was prescribed but appeared to exacerbate his symptoms. Lorazepam was substituted, with considerable improvement. At a follow-up examination 10 months after the last visit the patient was placid and friendly and exhibited no aggressive outbursts. His speech was unimproved, but he remained largely independent in activities of daily living; he continued to drive his car in his neighborhood and also from his suburban home to this hospital. His ADL score indicated 26 percent impairment. His performance on cognitive tests administered five weeks later revealed substantial deterioration in verbal and nonverbal memory, verbal fluency, ability to name common objects, drawing skills, and visuospatial perception.\nOne month later the patient returned to the hospital. His wife described further deterioration in his status, with increased difficulty in speech. He had set a fire in the yard of his home. He tended to drive through stoplights and to pass other cars in the wrong lane. He still had outbreaks of irritability of short duration; he continued to take lorazepam, which was believed to be helpful. On physical examination the pulse was 80 and the blood pressure 130/95 mm Hg; the weight was 87 kg. The patient mimicked hand gestures but performed none on verbal command and named none of the common objects that were presented to him. The Blessed Dementia Scale score was 31. Neurologic examination was unchanged in other respects; no focal abnormalities were found. The patient's wife was advised not to permit him to drive an automobile. Three months later another cranial MRI scan was unchanged.\nTwo weeks later the patient was brought in urgently by his wife because of extreme agitation, with physical and verbal abusiveness, despite increased doses of lorazepam; haloperidol had been substituted, with improvement in his demeanor. His wife reported that he generally ignored simple commands and was resistant to taking a shower or putting on clean clothes. In addition, he often arose in the middle of the night, shaved himself, and then sat up in the living room instead of returning to bed. Physical examination revealed a mild increase in muscle tone, without tremors; the patient walked with a good arm swing and no en bloc turning; he was able to hop unsupported on either foot.\nTwo and a half months later the patient was reported to be unable to comprehend most spoken commands and was totally unable to express himself. He was again having outbursts of irritability and had episodes of irrational behavior; he had attempted to jump out of a moving automobile, and he continued to resist bathing and changing his clothes. He visited a daycare center two days weekly. On physical examination the blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg; the weight was 84 kg. The patient was incapable of expressing himself and followed no verbal commands except when they were accompanied by gestures. Muscle tone was slightly increased bilaterally; no tremor or involuntary movements were seen. He walked with a full arm swing and mild en bloc turning. The snout reflex was still present.\nSix months later the patient returned to the hospital. In the interval he had been in a veterans hospital for two weeks, where the dose of haloperidol was increased from 3 to 9 mg daily, with good control of his aggressive behavior. He now submitted to being bathed and underwent a haircut without struggling, and he permitted his wife to transport him in an automobile without objection. The patient required an incontinence garment; he still attempted unsuccessfully to shave himself with an electric shaver. On physical examination the pulse was 92 and the blood pressure 155/85 mm Hg; the weight was 82 kg. The patient sat impassively, with severe immobility. A prominent snout reflex was again present, and bilateral grasp reflexes were elicited for the first time. Muscle tone was moderately increased bilaterally; occasional tremulous movements were observed. The patient required use of the hands to stand up from a chair but had no difficulty in initiating his stride. His posture was slightly stooped; his steps were 15 to 23 cm apart, with absence of arm swing and with marked en bloc turning; all movements were performed slowly.\nThe patient was admitted to a nursing home, where he died four months after his final visit to this hospital and approximately four years after the onset of symptoms.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Bryan T. Woods\\*: The primary feature of this patient's clinical presentation was a chronic, progressive familial dementia. Moreover, because two of four siblings, including the patient, and their father died of a similar disease, albeit at somewhat different ages, it is probable that the disorder was genetic, with an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance. This conclusion, if valid, markedly limits the number of diagnoses that I must consider.\\*Director, Department of Neurology and Brain Imaging Center, McLean Hospital; associate neurologist. Massachusetts General Hospital; associate professor of neurology. Harvard Medical School.The next critical item of information that helps to narrow the differential diagnosis is the age at the onset of the illness \u2014 the seventh decade in the patient, the sixth decade in his brother, and the eighth decade in their father. These data restrict the range of disorders to those that are first manifest in middle to late life.The third and most important facet of the case is the neurologic examination. Patients with progressive dementia of hereditary\u2014familial types may have several patterns of neurologic abnormalities ([Table 1](#t001)). They often have the first pattern of deficit, diffuse cognitive impairment, but there are well-documented syndromes in which the only main feature for a long time is a pattern of deficit attributable to primary involvement of one focal cortical region or function area \u2014 frontal, medial temporal, occipitoparietal, or language. Of course, to make a diagnosis of a localized deficit it is necessary not only to show a deficit in the particular function, such as language in this case, but also to demonstrate that other functions are intact.Of the degenerations in the diencephalon ([Table 1](#t001)) primary thalamic degeneration is rare, but in about half the reported cases it has been familial.[1](#core-r001) The associated dementia may include both \"frontal\" and memory deficits. Depression and hypersomnolence may be prominent, and electroencephalographic study is said to show diffuse slowing. There are no pathognomonic pathological features.Dementia and parkinsonism are frequently associated, as they were in the patient under discussion, and diseases characterized by that combination of disorders will be part of my final differential diagnosis. Pallidoluysian or subthalamic-nucleus degeneration, sometimes associated with dentatorubral degeneration, may be accompanied by dementia, as may striatonigral degeneration, but this patient did not show evidence of a hyperkinetic movement disorder. Progressive supranuclear palsy, with its characteristic voluntary-gaze abnormalities, parkinsonism, and dementia, has not been observed in a familial form, and the patient did not show evidence of ocular abnormalities or pseudobulbar signs. Similarly, the absence of ataxia, weakness, spasticity, sensory loss, areflexia, postural hypotension, and muscle wasting permits the exclusion of a large number of the familial syndromes that are grouped under the general heading of spinocerebellar degenerations, as well as the elimination of hereditary muscular dystrophies, myotonias, and myopathies from the differential diagnosis.The patient never manifested most of the abnormalities that have been observed to precede or accompany dementia in many of the inherited degenerative disorders of the nervous system. He did, however, have several discrete cortical-function abnormalities \u2014 initially aphasia and \"frontal\" signs, then a somewhat less prominent memory disturbance, and later in the course of the illness visuospatial difficulties. If that pattern of deficits had been all that was observed, the differential diagnosis would have been very restricted. The patient was also noted to have parkinsonian abnormalities, however, which appeared only after he was being treated with haloperidol, a neuroleptic medication, and became pronounced after the dose of haloperidol had been increased from 3 to 9 mg a day. Since neuroleptic medication could account for the patient's rigidity, akinesia, and tremor, I cannot say whether intrinsic late parkinsonism was a clinical feature of the primary disease or whether that part of the picture was iatrogenic. At this stage the possibility that the parkinsonism was part of the disease must remain open.The other major categories of clinical and laboratory observations relevant to the diagnosis are listed in [Table 2](#t002). The time course of the patient's illness and that of his brother was two to four years. None of the affected family members ever had either myoclonic or generalized seizures, an important negative historical finding. Both the electroencephalographic study and the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid were negative except for a borderline elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein level. We are not given results of any special chemical studies, and no biopsy specimens were obtained. Metabolic imaging showed a diffuse decrease in posterior and anterior blood flow rather than any focal abnormality, either of the left-hemisphere speech area or of the frontal lobes. That observation will also be important in the differential diagnosis.The two MRI scans were done 16 months apart. Dr. Chin, will you describe the findings?Dr. John K. Chin: A T1-weighted image from the MRI study ([Fig. 1](#f001)) performed around the time of the initial follow-up visit demonstrates generalized enlargement of the ventricular system and the subarachnoid spaces. A T1-weighted image obtained higher up in the cranium reveals slight-to-moderate enlargement of the lateral ventricles as well as the enlarged subarachnoid spaces, especially involving the anterior interhemispheric fissure and the sulci in the anterior cerebral cortex. An image from the T2-weighted sequence ([Fig. 2](#f002)) demonstrates nonspecific T2 hyperintensity in a periventricular distribution. On the MRI scan obtained 16 months later we again see the sulcal enlargement, with prominence of the sylvian fissures as well as the ventricular system. Although in general the findings on this study are essentially unchanged, a little more enlargement of the lateral ventricles is shown on the second study. Again we see the enlargement of the anterior interhemispheric fissure as well as the small gyri in the anterior cerebral cortex. The nonspecific periventricular T2 hyperintensity remained. We again see the generalized distribution of the cerebral atrophic changes but with specific involvement of the anterior cerebral cortex.Dr. Woods: Two points can be made about the MRI scans. The first is that there is some evidence of progression of the enlargement of the lateral ventricles. The second finding of importance in the differential diagnosis is the degree of predominance of the anterior cortical atrophy, both frontal and anterotemporal, as opposed to a more diffuse distribution. One other point of consideration regarding the scans is that on some of the sections one can see a decreased T2 signal in the basal ganglia. Such a decrease, which is due to iron deposition, can be a marker for degenerative disorders,[2](#core-r002)but increased iron deposition is also associated with normal aging. In this case it was apparently consistent with the patient's age of 69 years and the degree of degeneration that the brain had undergone.At this point a great number of known causes of familial dementia have been eliminated from consideration. The remaining possibilities are listed in [Table 3](#t003). Although no diagnosis on this list can be excluded without pathological data, they are not all equally likely. I shall leave the first diagnosis on my list, Gerstmann\u2014Str\u00e4ussler\u2014Scheinker disease, for last, however, and look briefly at the others.Familial Alzheimer's disease was regarded as rare until recently, but it has now been observed that the likelihood that a person with Alzheimer's disease will have two or more first-degree relatives with dementia is 40 times greater than that of an age-matched, non-demented control.[2](#core-r002) On the basis of these and other epidemiologic data[3](#core-r003) it has been suggested that familial Alzheimer's disease is the rule rather than the exception. Alzheimer's disease can, of course, present with aphasia and can be associated with parkinsonism. The diffuse abnormalities seen in this patient on a SPECT examination are also consistent with that diagnosis. On the other hand, the usual duration of illness before death reported in well-documented cases of Alzheimer's disease is 7 to 10 years, not 2 to 4 years.The patient's aphasia and \"frontal\" signs plus the initial CT scan reports, by suggesting predominant involvement of the frontal and anterotemporal regions, strongly suggested Pick's disease, although the later MRI scans were reported as showing less discrete changes. Once again, however, as with familial Alzheimer's disease, the duration of Pick's disease is usually longer \u2014 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 years in one study.[4](#core-r004) In addition, the failure of the SPECT data to indicate an anterior prominence of the blood-flow deficits is against the diagnosis of Pick's disease, since it has been stated that the observed pattern of reduction in anterior flow is diagnostic of that disorder.[5](#core-r005)Creutzfeldt\u2014Jakob disease can present with aphasia[6](#core-r006) rather than with initial visuospatial deficits. In up to 15 percent of the cases this disease is reported to be familial,[7](#core-r007) but the findings in this case are atypical for that disorder in other respects. Ataxia and myoclonus were not seen, and the electroencephalographic study did not demonstrate the typical periodic sharp-wave abnormalities. Furthermore, the patient's illness was too long rather than too short, since patients with Creutzfeldt\u2014Jakob disease usually die within a year after the onset of symptoms. Nonetheless, awareness of the variability and range of human slow-virus or \"prion\" disorders[8](#core-r008) is rapidly expanding, and a variant of Creutzfeldt\u2014Jakob disease, although unlikely, cannot be excluded with complete confidence.The likelihood of the next three disorders in [Table 3](#t003) (familial dementia\u2014parkinsonism, late-onset Hallervorden\u2014Spatz disease, and familial diffuse Lewy-body disease), all of which are associated with parkinsonism, is very small unless the patient's parkinsonism was not medication-induced. A case of familial parkinsonism\u2014dementia with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been reported,[9](#core-r009) but one would have to postulate that this patient's disorder was a variant without the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Late-onset familial Hallervorden\u2014Spatz disease[10](#core-r010) is an interesting possibility, but the authors of a recent report described unique MRI-scan changes in this disease restricted to the globus pallidus, with a finding called the \"tiger's eye\" sign.[11](#core-r011) Moreover, in view of the absence of a history of parkinsonism in the affected brother and father, in contrast to its prominence in reported cases of familial Hallervorden\u2014Spatz disease, that diagnosis seems highly unlikely. The argument for a diagnosis of diffuse Lewy-body disease[12](#core-r012) is even weaker, since parkinsonism should be prominent in all the affected persons, and to date no familial cases have been reported. The last diagnosis in [Table 3](#t003), unclassified familial dementia syndrome, is perhaps statistically the most likely but intellectually the least satisfying. Nonetheless, a number of authors have reported just such familial dementia syndromes that cannot be fitted into any well-established pathological category.[13,14](#core-r013) In particular, there are familial cases in which examination of either one brain region, such as the frontal lobe or thalamus, or the whole cerebrum showed neuronal loss and gliosis but not the specific changes that would permit assignment to a known diagnostic category. This patient may have had such an as yet unclassifiable entity.I come finally to my first diagnostic choice, which is Gerstmann\u2014Str\u00e4ussler\u2014Scheinker disease. This remarkable slow-virus disorder,[8](#core-r008) which is transmissible to primates and in which a specific genetic defect leading to an abnormal allele of the so-called prion protein has been documented,[15](#core-r015) requires a brain biopsy or postmortem examination for a definitive diagnosis.[8](#core-r008) Nevertheless, it is familial, with a pattern of occurrence similar to that of an autosomal-dominant disorder in the great majority of the cases.[8](#core-r008) The disease has an average duration of about five years from the onset of symptoms to death.[8](#core-r008) It has presented in one large kindred as a primary dementia with minimal symptoms of parkinsonism and absence of ataxia and myoclonus.[16](#core-r016) This \"telencephalic\" form appears to be the result of an allelic variant in which valine is substituted for alanine at a single codon of the prion protein.[17](#core-r017) The electroencephalogram is usually normal in this form, as in the ataxic form.[16](#core-r016) The disease differs clinically from Creutzfeldt\u2014Jakob disease (which along with kuru constitutes the other established human slow-virus or prion disease) in its longer course, absence of seizures, and a normal electroencephalographic pattern, but the definitive distinction is pathological. If examination of the patient's cortex and basal ganglia shows large numbers of congophilic multicentric amyloid plaques that react with antibodies to the prion protein,[8](#core-r008) the diagnosis is confirmed.Dr. E. Tessa Hedley-Whyte: Dr. Growdon, you were the patient's physician. Will you comment?Dr. John H. Growdon: We did not consider Gerstmann\u2014Str\u00e4ussler\u2014Scheinker disease, largely because of the absence of motor symptoms and signs when the patient was first seen. Our differential diagnosis was between Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease. Because the neuroimaging examinations did not reveal lobar atrophy, we concluded that Alzheimer's disease was the probable diagnosis.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Ann C. McKee: The autopsy was restricted to the brain, which weighed 1320 g. Inspection of the superior surface showed atrophy of the frontal lobes, with the left hemisphere more severely involved than the right. The atrophy spared the precentral and post-central gyri. The left superior parietal lobule was markedly involved, and the right was only minimally affected. The occipital lobes appeared normal. Examination of the inferior surface of the brain revealed bilateral temporal-lobe atrophy, most prominent in the temporal poles and the inferior and medial temporal gyri; the parahippocampal gyri were less severely involved. Transverse sectioning through the brain stem revealed slight pallor of the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. Coronal sectioning of the cerebral hemispheres demonstrated enlargement of the ventricular system, most marked in the temporal horns. The ventricular volume was 26 ml of water, more than double the normal value. The central and subcortical white matter was slightly reduced in volume. Slight atrophy of the head of the caudate nucleus was evident, although the remainder of the basal ganglia and the thalamus appeared normal. There was moderate shrinkage of the hippocampus and amygdala bilaterally.Histologic examination of the cerebral cortex disclosed more widespread damage than was evident on gross examination. In the most severely affected areas there was a marked reduction in the width of the cortex, with extensive neuronal loss and astrocytic proliferation. In these areas the changes were most severe in the superficial cortical layers, and there was often a striking vacuolization of layer 2. There was no spongiform change in the deeper neuropil, however, to suggest either Creutzfeldt\u2014Jakob disease or Gerstmann\u2014Str\u00e4ussler disease. Examination of the deeper cortical layers showed occasional abnormal neurons with swollen, rounded cell bodies and generally round, pale, eccentric nuclei, which contained prominent nucleoli. Luxol-fast bluehematoxylinand-eosin (the) staining identified finely granular, occasionally vacuolated eosinophilic cytoplasm ([Fig. 3](#f003)A). Cells stained with cresyl violet contained small amounts of Nissl substance, usually displaced to the periphery ([Fig. 3](#f003)B). The Palmgren silver stain demonstrated diffuse golden-brown cytoplasmic staining of swollen neurons ([Fig. 3](#f003)C). In general, abnormal neurons were more prominent in minimally affected areas with less severe gliosis. No intranuclear or intracytoplasmic inclusions were identified with the and silver stains except for rare neurofibrillary tangles restricted to the entorhinal cortex. Pick, Lewy, or Lafora bodies were not present. Both silver stains and specific antibody stains demonstrated widespread deposition of \u03b2-amyloid protein in the neocortex.The regional pattern of cortical atrophy was paralleled by regional changes in the underlying white matter. The white matter of the frontal and temporal lobes was gliotic, with loss of myelinated fibers and occasional accumulations of fat-laden macrophages; the optic radiations and subcortical fibers were relatively spared. Small blood vessels within the white matter had thickened walls and widened perivascular spaces, but the changes were not sufficiently severe or widespread to suggest Binswanger's leukoencephalopathy. Congophilic amyloid deposits were not seen in either meningeal or intracortical blood vessels.The basal ganglia and subcortical nuclei were also affected. Examination of the claustrum and amygdala revealed diffuse gliosis, neuronal loss, and ballooned neurons. The striatum was similarly affected, and the pallidum, thalamus, subthalamic nuclei, and red nuclei were affected to a lesser degree. Neuronal loss, gliosis, and pigment phagocytosis were observed in the substantia nigra. Lewy bodies were not present. In the cerebral peduncles the frontopontine tract showed evidence of wallerian degeneration. Swollen neurons were present in the locus ceruleus and raphe nuclei. There were no microscopic changes in the cerebellum, medulla, or cervical portion of the spinal cord.The abnormally swollen neurons present in this case have typically been associated with a variety of neuropathologic disorders. Proximal axotomy, such as that produced by subcortical infarction, may induce a stereotyped series of perikaryal changes, with the Nissl substance displaced to the periphery of the cell as the perikaryon swells; the nucleus becomes eccentrically placed, and the nucleolus becomes prominent. No such infarction or axonal interruptions were found, however. Similar neuronal changes occur in pellagra, although motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord are primarily affected in that disorder. Corticodentatonigral degeneration with neuronal achromasia, an entity originally described by Rebeiz and his coworkers,[18](#core-r018) characteristically affects the posterior frontal and parietal cortexes. In that disorder, circumscribed atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes is not found.The constellation of neuropathological features in the case under discussion is characteristic of Pick's lobar atrophy, first recognized by Pick[19,20](#core-r019) during the years 1892 to 1904 and defined microscopically by Alzheimer[21](#core-r021) in 1911. Alzheimer described the characteristic neuronal swellings, occasionally referred to as Pick cells, and the argyrophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Pick bodies now associated with this disorder. Pick's disease is characterized by circumscribed atrophy, which may be restricted to the frontal or temporal lobes, either singly or in combination. Less commonly, the process diffuses to involve the parietal lobes, as seen in the case under discussion, and only rarely affects the occipital lobes. The brain weight is characteristically reduced, and the ventricles are correspondingly enlarged. There are three patterns of histologic abnormality. In all the cases, cortical and subcortical gliosis with neuronal loss and white-matter degeneration is found. In addition, 20 percent of the patients have ballooned neurons and Pick bodies, 40 percent of them have swollen neurons without Pick bodies, as in this case, and 40 percent have neither neuronal alteration.[22](#core-r022)In this case there is a high degree of concordance between the clinical presentation of the patient and the distribution of atrophy. The prominent symptoms, including profound aphasia, personality change, perseveration, and memory disturbance, indicated widespread dysfunction of the frontal and temporal lobes, corresponding well with the distribution of the pathologic changes, which were more severe in the dominant hemisphere. The primary motor, sensory, and visual cortexes were spared, a finding consistent with the preservation of the function of those areas. All the major language areas were markedly affected by the disease, including Broca's area, the area concerned with motor aspects of speech, Wernicke's area, subserving perception of spoken language, the angular convolution thought to be involved in the perception of written language, and the supramarginal gyrus, which together with the angular gyrus make up the central language zone.Immunocytochemical analysis of neurons predisposed to degeneration in Pick's disease may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of the disorder. Previous studies[23\u201327](#core-r023) with use of a variety of defined types of antiserum have disclosed that Pick bodies contain antigenic determinants identical to those found in Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles despite their ultrastructural dissimilarities. Further analysis of the chromatolytic neurons in Pick's disease[28,29](#core-r028) has demonstrated the presence of phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes normally restricted to the axonal compartment.In collaboration with Dr. Bradley T. Hyman I performed immunocytochemical studies on several cortical and subcortical regions from the patient under discussion. Chromatolytic pyramidal-projection neurons that normally contain only nonphosphorylated neurofilament in their perikarya accumulated phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes ([Fig. 3](#f003)C and [3](#f003)D). In addition, a number of nonpyramidal local-circuit cortical neurons enriched in calbindin D28k and parvalbumin were swollen and achromasic ([Fig. 3](#f003)E and [3](#f003)F). Thus, several morphologically and biochemically distinct classes of neurons are affected in Pick's disease.Two additional immunocytochemical observations were striking. We found widespread extracellular deposition of \u03b2-amyloid protein, a 40\u2014amino acid protein fragment derived from a transmembrane precursor protein and a primary constituent of senile-plaque amyloid.[30](#core-r030) Widespread \u03b2-amyloid protein deposition occurs in a large proportion of elderly patients without dementia[31,32](#core-r031) as well as in most patients with diffuse Lewy-body disease[33](#core-r033) and in all patients with Alzheimer's disease.[32](#core-r032) The presence of \u03b2 protein in the brain alone cannot differentiate patients with dementia from control subjects without dementia. Clinical dementia in diffuse Lewy-body disease and Alzheimer's disease is associated with the accumulation of abnormal proteins within neurons, in the form of Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary degeneration, respectively. Diffuse \u03b2-amyloid protein deposition is commonly found in Lewy-body disease.[33](#core-r033) It may also occur in Pick's disease, since widespread senile plaques have been found in a number of cases.[14](#core-r014) It is not known if the character or distribution of \u03b2-amyloid protein differs among these three dementing disorders or whether \u03b2-amyloid protein has a direct role in the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration. There is recent evidence, however, that solubilized \u03b2 protein may be neurotoxic in cell culture and in vivo.[34\u201336](#core-r034)The monoclonal antibody Alz 50, which recognizes a phosphorylated form of the microtubule protein, tau, diffusely stains neurons at a stage of degeneration before the development of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease.[37](#core-r037) Pick bodies have been reported previously to be immunoreactive to Alz 50,[27](#core-r027) but diffuse neuronal staining by Alz 50 has not been reported previously in Pick's disease. We found diffusely stained Alz-50\u2014immunoreactive neurons in affected regions of the cortex and subcortical nuclei in a pattern corresponding to the distribution of gliosis and achromasia that I described earlier ([Fig. 4](#f004)). Alz 50 labeled both achromasic neurons and normal-appearing neurons in a striking laminar pattern throughout affected regions of the cortex despite the absence of neurofibrillary tangles. The pattern of Alz-50 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus of the case under discussion was strikingly different from that in Alzheimer's disease, with prominent involvement of dentate granule cells and diffuse involvement of hippocampal pyramids. Specific subsets of Alz-50\u2014positive neurons, which were often achromasic, were seen in the striatum, globus pallidus, thalamus, and other subcortical structures. The great majority of Alz-50\u2014positive neurons appeared morphologically normal.Our findings suggest that the Alz-50 antibody may identify early stages of neuronal degeneration in both Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease. If specific and consistent patterns of Alz-50 immunoreactivity are found in a larger series of cases of Pick's disease, it may be possible to make that diagnosis with greater precision in cases of less severe or atypical disease, such as those not involving achromasic neurons or Pick bodies. The relation among Pick's disease, corticobasal or corticodentatonigral degeneration with neuronal achromasia, progressive subcortical gliosis, and other neurodegenerative disorders may also be elucidated by this approach.Dr. Woods: In 1984 Morris et al.[14](#core-r014) discussed a familial syndrome that fell between Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease and pointed out that there was a continuum rather than a sharp distinction between the two disorders. This case accords well with the sense of that paper. Also, the differential diagnosis brings out some of the dramatic new developments in molecular biology that are allowing these disorders to be distinguished at a basic level.\n",

      "question": "A 55-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of anemia.\nShe was well until three months earlier, when she experienced the insidious onset of weakness, malaise and exertional dyspnea. One month later she began to hear roaring in the ears on recumbency. One month before admission a physician found that she was anemic. A single injection of vitamin B\n12\nwas given, without response, and she was referred to this hospital.\nTwelve years previously one of several enlarged supraclavicular lymph nodes was removed for biopsy; microscopical examination was reported to show hyperplasia. The other enlarged lymph nodes persisted without change thereafter. Two and a half years before admission hypertension was found, and a combination of reserpine, hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide was prescribed. She did not smoke and consumed little alcohol. Sixteen months before entry an x-ray film of the chest disclosed soft-tissue fullness in the left superior mediastinum that was considered to be a vascular shadow; the lungs and heart were normal. During the two months before admission she lost 2.7 kg in weight.\nThere was no history of fever, chills, night sweats, pruritus, hematemesis, melena, thoracic or abdominal pain, rash or arthralgia. There was no family history of an autoimmune disorder.\nThe temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 105, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 150/65 mm Hg.\nExamination revealed an obese, pale woman with scleral icterus. No rash was noted. Shotty, soft supraclavicular lymph nodes were palpated bilaterally. The lungs were clear. The heart was enlarged, and a Grade 3 systolic ejection murmur was heard at the pulmonic area. Abdominal examination revealed that the spleen descended 4 cm below the left costal margin; the liver was not felt.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 18.5 per cent, and the hemoglobin 6 g per 100 ml. The white-cell count was 8400, with 64 per cent neutrophils, 3 per cent band forms, 19 per cent lymphocytes, 6 per cent monocytes, 1 per cent eosinophils, 2 per cent basophils, 2 per cent myelocytes and 3 per cent meta-myelocytes; 1 nucleated red cell was seen per 100 white cells; numerous spherocytes and intense polychromasia were observed. The platelet count was 128,000, and the reticulocyte count 33.6 per cent. The prothrombin time was 10.4 seconds, with a control of 11.3 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 22 seconds. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 127 mm per hour. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The urea nitrogen was 12 mg, the glucose 106 mg, the calcium 9 mg, the conjugated bilirubin 0.7 mg, the total bilirubin 5.1 mg, and the protein 7.3 g (the albumin 4.6 g, and the globulin 2.7 g) per 100 ml. The glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) was 25 U, the amylase 12 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 3.5 Bodansky U. An electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal rhythm at a rate of 95, with minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. X-ray films of the chest (\nFig. 1\n) revealed a slightly lobulated, noncalcified left anterior mediastinal mass; the lungs were clear; the heart was enlarged, with a cardiothoracic ratio of 13:23. Tomographic examination of the mediastinum disclosed a homogeneous anterior mediastinal mass that extended more to the left than to the right of the midline; no calcification was observed within it, and the trachea did not appear deviated or invaded. The vitamin B\n12\nlevel was 175 pg per milliliter. A direct Coombs test was positive; the gamma Coombs test was + +, and the non-gamma Coombs test \u00b1. Tests for cold agglutinins, rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibodies were negative. Serum immunoelectrophoresis and agarose-gel electrophoresis were normal. A needle aspiration and biopsy of the bone marrow revealed erythroid hyperplasia; there was no evidence of a malignant tumor or granulomas.\nPrednisone, 100 mg, and folic acid, 2 mg, were administered daily. On the 11th hospital day the hematocrit was 20.4 per cent, and the hemoglobin 6.8 g per 100 ml; the white-cell count was 11,000, with 81 per cent neutrophils. The platelet count was 154,000, and the reticulocyte count 13.2 per cent. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, and the hematocrit rose to 31 per cent.\nOn the 15th hospital day an operation was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDR. David S. Rosenthal\\*: In summary, this 55-year-old obese woman entered the hospital because of gradually progressive anemia. On physical examination, in addition to the long standing supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, she was found to have splenomegaly and a large anterior mediastinal mass, which probably had been present for a number of months. The laboratory studies disclosed marked reticulocytosis with spherocytes and polychromatophilia, hyperbilirubinemia, a positive direct Coombs test and erythroid hyperplasia of the bone marrow diagnostic of an immunohemolytic anemia. Dr. Greene, may we see the x-ray films now?DR. Reginald E. Greene: A film taken 16 months before admission shows a smoothly outlined, homogeneous, noncalcified soft-tissue density above the aortic arch with an outward convexity toward the lung. The tracheal air column has a normal course. The lungs are clear, and the heart is at the upper limit of normal in size. The films obtained on admission to this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) demonstrate the outline of a soft-tissue mass lying over and above the aortic arch. It is larger than on the previous examination and has a lobulated double-convex contour projecting to the left. The trachea and hilar structures are normal. The lungs are clear except for slight irregularity at the apex consistent with scarring. The heart is at the upper limit of normal in size. Tomograms, with oblique and lateral views, demonstrate the mass anterior and superior to the aortic arch. There is no evidence of displacement of the trachea or abnormality of its lumen.DR. Rosenthal: The three major topics for discussion in this case are the acquired immunohemolytic anemia, the anterior mediastinal mass, which may have been the primary disorder resulting in the anemia, and the long standing lymphadenopathy.Immunohemolytic anemia has been divided into primary and secondary forms. The term \"secondary\" or \"symptomatic\" hemolytic anemia has been applied since 1939, initially by Watson[1](#core-r001) and later by Singer and Dameshek,[2](#core-r002) to differentiate it from the idiopathic variety. In an extensive review of 250 carefully investigated cases of immunohemolytic anemia Dacie[3](#core-r003) found that in 86 it was secondary. The underlying or associated disease was neoplastic in about 40 per cent of the cases and suspected to be an infection, such as viral pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, tuberculosis and subacute bacterial endocarditis, in a comparable number. The remainder of the patients had an autoimmune disorder related to systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis. In a more recent review of cases of immunohemolytic anemia Pirofsky[4](#core-r004) reported that in more than 80 per cent it was the secondary type. The higher proportion of such cases in his series can be attributed to longer follow-up investigation, a greater number of diagnostic procedures and the identification of other causes of immunohemolytic anemia \u2014 for example, reaction to medications such as methyldopa. We recentlysaw a patient who presented with an autoimmune hemolytic anemia of a non-gamma Coombspositive type. The initial history, physical examination, laboratory investigations and routine diagnostic radiologic studies revealed no cause, but a subsequent laparotomy with biopsy of a mesenteric lymph node and the liver disclosed diffuse histiocytic lymphoma. Of 190 patients with secondary immunohemolytic anemia in the series of Pirofsky[4](#core-r004) 114, or 60 per cent, had a neoplasm of the reticuloendothelial system. Sixty-eight per cent of the tumors were leukemia, mostly of the chronic lymphocytic type, 22 per cent were lymphomas, 8 per cent were plasma-cell myelomas, and 2 per cent were thymomas. Additional causes of secondary immunohemolytic anemia included carcinoma and other malignant tumors, as well as benign cysts, collagen vascular disorders, thyroid disease, infection and gastrointestinal-tract disease. Interestingly enough, drugs were implicated in only 3 per cent of the cases. This patient received three cardiac medications, two of which have been associated with blood dyscrasias or immune disorders but not specifically with immunohemolytic anemia. A syndrome resembling systemic lupus erythematosus can develop in patients on hydralazine.[5](#core-r005) Hydrochlorothiazide can cause an immune neutropenia or thrombocytopenia,[6](#core-r006) and reserpine has rarely been associated with thrombocytopenic purpura.The immunohemolytic anemias may be characterized as warm or cold or as gamma or non-gamma Coombs-positive, according to the type of antibody attracted to the red cell. The patient under discussion apparently had a secondary autoimmune hemolytic anemia of a gamma Coombs-positive type with minimal non-gamma activity. Most gamma Coombs-positive hemolytic anemias are of the warm antibody type, and tests for cold agglutinins are usually negative, as in this case. Immunohemolytic anemia may antedate by months or years the appearance of an underlying disease, such as malignant lymphoma.[3,7,8](#core-r003) Usually, however, in patients with Hodgkin's disease and carcinoma the anemia is associated with advanced disease. The prognosis generally depends on the nature of the primary disease, although some investigators believe that the prognosis for nongamma Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia is better than that for the gamma Coombs-positive type. In one series 85 patients with the warm type of Coombspositive hemolytic anemia had a 46 per cent mortality rate, with death usually within the first two years, whereas more than half of those with the cold type of antibody survived for more than five years.[9](#core-r009) In general, however, the prognosis corresponds to that of the underlying primary disease.The presence of a mediastinal mass in this patient certainly suggests a lymphoreticular neoplasm, although other possibilities, such as a thymoma, have to be considered. Thymomas have more frequently been associated with an aregenerative anemia with erythroid hypoplasia in the marrow. In Pirofsky's series, however, there were three patients with Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia who presented with or later proved to have a thymoma.[4](#core-r004) The clinical findings in the case under discussion would certainly be unusual for a thymoma. Teratomas may occur in the anterior mediastinum but are only rarely associated with immunohemolytic anemia, and no calcification of the mediastinal mass was seen on the tomograms. A substernal thyroid gland may present as a mediastinal mass but can often be shown to move with swallowing on fluoroscopic examination. The first manifestation of sarcoidosis may be a mediastinal mass, but this disorder is rarely associated with immunohemolytic anemia. The serum calcium level was not elevated, and there were no symptoms of uveitis or arthritis to suggest this diagnosis.By far the most common cause of a mediastinal mass, such as that demonstrated on the x-ray films in this case, is a lymphoreticular neoplasm. The initial presentation of Hodgkin's disease is often the radiologic demonstration of a mediastinal mass in an asymptomatic person. The occurrence of an immunohemolytic anemia has been reported in association with Hodgkin's disease, with a frequency that has varied from 2.7 to 8 per cent of the cases.[8,10](#core-r008) In the series of 31 cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with a malignant reticulosis reported by Dacie[3](#core-r003) there were only two cases of Hodgkin's disease. Of the 219 patients with Hodgkin's disease studied at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1954 to 1960 only six, or 2.7 per cent, were found to have a positive Coombs test.[10](#core-r010) In one case the autoimmune hemolytic anemia preceded the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease, and in another the diagnoses were made simultaneously. In all the cases but one the immunohemolytic anemia was associated with advanced Hodgkin's disease, usually Stage III. In one report immunohemolytic anemia and a Pel-Ebstein type of fever heralded the onset of Hodgkin's disease.[3](#core-r003) Thus, clinically apparent immunohemolytic anemia only rarely precedes the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease. In two cases of Hodgkin's disease reported by Dacie the autoantibody proved to be of the warm or gamma Coombs-positive type, and in one of the two cases a cold agglutinin was also present in a low titer. In some of the early reports of Hodgkin's disease and hemolytic anemia reference is made to patients with splenomegaly in whom a diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease was made by splenectomy. Removal of the spleen may be indicated in such patients and sometimes has resulted in moderate or even dramatic improvement in the hemolytic anemia. In the case under discussion the radiologic picture is typical of Hodgkin's disease. The sedimentation rate was elevated but doesn't serve as a differential point among the various types of malignant lymphoma. As mentioned previously, a number of patients with the early stage of Hodgkin's disease have no symptoms whatsoever. Hodgkin's disease certainly deserves a leading place in the differential diagnosis in this case.Immunohemolytic anemia is better known, however, as a complication of non-Hodgkin lymphoma than of any other reticuloendothelial neoplasm except chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, the anemia may antedate the appearance of the malignant lymphoma by months or years and may be the first sign of it. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been described in association with what was referred to in the past as reticulum-cell sarcoma, lymphosarcoma or giant follicular lymphoma (Brill-Simmers disease).[3,11](#core-r003) With the more recent classifications of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas autoimmune hemolytic anemia is more often associated with lymphomas of B-cell origin than T-cell origin. Newer entities, such as angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy[11,12](#core-r011) and immunoblastic sarcoma,[13,14](#core-r013) have a high association with a positive Coombs test. Angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy, although uncommon,[12](#core-r012) is noteworthy in that more than half the patients with that disorder have had a positive Coombs test. However, most of the patients present with generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, skin rash and fever. The onset is acute, and the findings do not fit with the course in the case under discussion. In a review of 515 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma followed from 1960 to 1971 Jones[15](#core-r015) found that 11 of them, a little less than 2 per cent, also had immunohemolytic anemia; of the patients whose autoantibody was characterized three had the gamma Coombs-positive type, and two had the non-gamma Coombs-positive type.The pathogenesis of immunohemolytic anemia in cases of reticuloendothelial neoplasia is of interest but remains unclear. The development of lymphoma in association with an autoimmune disorder has been studied in animal models. In the New Zealand black mouse there is a very high frequency of the spontaneous occurrence of immunohemolytic anemia, and various forms of treatment have resulted in the development of lymphoma in almost 75 per cent of the animals.[16](#core-r016) In cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma an autoimmune condition may precede, follow or coexist with the lymphoproliferative disorder. It is probable that the reported association is not accidental.The age of this patient and the concurrence of the immunohemolytic anemia with a mediastinal mass favor the diagnosis of a non-Hodgkin lymphoma rather than Hodgkin's disease. Another interesting aspect of this case is the history of long standing supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. We have all faced the problem of patients with enlarged lymph nodes that waxed and waned, finally increasing sufficiently in size to require a biopsy, which revealed Hodgkin's disease. In addition, we have often seen patients who presented with a newly enlarged lymph node that proved to be involved by malignant lymphoma, whereupon the patient has disclosed that an enlarged lymph node had been present in another area for many years with no change in size, and a biopsy of it has also disclosed malignant lymphoma.In conclusion, my diagnosis is malignant lymphoma associated with an autoimmune hemolytic anemia. On the basis of the absence of symptoms and the presence of a uniform mediastinal mass I believe that it was Hodgkin's disease, but certainly non-Hodgkin lymphoma is an alternative possibility. The diagnostic procedure was probably a mediastinoscopic examination and lymph-node biopsy. A splenectomy without a mediastinoscopic examination might have been of therapeutic value for the hemolytic anemia but might not have been diagnostic, since a patient may have malignant lymphoma and hemolytic anemia without splenic involvement.DR. John C. Long: Dr. Schoolnik, what was the conclusion of the medical students who discussed this case?DR. Gary K. Schoolnik: They believed that the anemia resulted from immune hemolysis associated with the enlarging anterior mediastinal mass. This association strongly suggested a lymphoreticular malignant tumor. They considered the clinical features most consistent with a non-Hodgkin lymphoma and thought that a mediastinoscopic examination was the next logical step in the evaluation of the patient.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDR. Leonard Ellman: It was decided that the patient should undergo a laparotomy, with the hope that the diagnosis would be made by splenectomy. Unfortunately, a diagnosis could not be made at the time of abdominal exploration, and the surgeon then performed a mediastinoscopic examination and lymph-node biopsy. Part of the decision to proceed in this manner was that the patient had a very severe hemolytic anemia that was apparently refractory to prednisone. We thought that a laparotomy offered the potential of control of the hemolytic anemia and might give us the diagnosis at the same time.DR. Long: At laparotomy dense fibrous adhesions were found between the tail of the pancreas and the splenic hilus. Microscopical examination of the 1850-g spleen disclosed several acute and organized infarcts, and numerous recent thrombi were adherent to branches of the splenic artery. The congested splenic red pulp had dilated sinusoids that contained foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis, and the malpighian follicles were atrophic. There was no evidence of malignant lymphoma in the specimen. Examination of a right paratracheal lymph node removed at the mediastinoscopic examination revealed an ill defined nodular lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered epithelioid cells disposed singly and in small clusters ([Fig. 2](#f002)). The cellular infiltrate was composed predominantly of small lymphocytes with round nuclei and scanty cytoplasm admixed with benign-appearing histiocytes with oval, vesicular nuclei, finely dispersed chromatin and acidophilic cytoplasm. Randomly distributed among the lymphocytes were numerous large cells with clear cytoplasm, twisted or hyperlobulated nuclei, stippled nuclear chromatin and small nucleoli. Examination of multiple sections was required to identify diagnostic Reed\u2013Sternberg cells with large, bilobed nuclei and huge inclusion-like nucleoli ([Fig. 3](#f003)). No fibrous bands were present, and neither plasma cells nor eosinophils were identified. On the basis of the presence of a vaguely nodular infiltrate of uniform small lymphocytes with numerous hyperlobulated large lymphoid cells with small nucleoli and a paucity of diagnostic Reed\u2013Sternberg cells we interpreted the lesion as Hodgkin's disease, lymphocyte-predominance type.DR. Greene: Although it is often mentioned that cervical mediastinoscopic examination is a method of obtaining tissue from masses in the anterior mediastinum in fact it is very difficult to approach the anterior mediastinum through the pretracheal planes. In this case it is noteworthy that the biopsy was of a paratracheal lymph node and not the anterior superior mediastinal mass itself.DR. Long: Dr. Ellman, will you discuss the management since the biopsy?DR. Ellman: The hemolytic anemia has been cured as a result of the splenectomy. Steroids were tapered rapidly in amount, and the hematocrit is normal. Unfortunately, she has been plagued with several surgical complications, including multiple pulmonary emboli and most recently a subphrenic abscess. During the drainage procedure for the subphrenic abscess interruption of the vena cava was performed because of the previous pulmonary emboli. When she is fully recovered she will receive upper-mantle radiation therapy.DR. James T. Heyl: Will you interpret the findings in the splenectomy specimen, Dr. Long?DR. Long: The splenomegaly was due, in part, to sinusoidal dilatation and congestion attributable to the autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The recent splenic infarcts were probably a result of thrombotic occlusion of small branches of the splenic artery. It is possible that some of the areas of fibrosis in the spleen represented healed foci of Hodgkin's disease that had undergone necrosis. However, we examined multiple sections and found no evidence of tumor. In addition to the unusual splenic lesions there was considerable perisplenic fibrosis with dense scarring in the region of the hilus, necessitating removal in continuity of a portion of the adherent distal pancreas. Microscopically, there was no evidence of pancreatitis.DR. Ellman: In our review of the literature we could find only two cases in which an autoimmune hemolytic anemia occurred at the time of the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease or preceded it.[17](#core-r017) In one of the cases the anemia preceded the Hodgkin's disease by several years, and it is possible that the association was merely a coincidence. It is very rare for immune hemolytic anemia to be the initial manifestation of Hodgkin's disease.\n",

      "question": "A 22-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of increasing swelling of the face.\nThe patient had been well until 20 months earlier, when a swelling developed on the inner aspect of the right upper lip, with firm, slightly tender nodules. The lesions enlarged gradually, and the patient soon detected a second, similarly affected area along the buccal mucosa beside the right lower jaw.\nTen months before admission a biopsy of the lesions was performed elsewhere. Microscopical examination of the specimen was reported to show a dense inflammatory infiltrate that included lymphocytes and histiocytes, with foci of necrosis. The findings were believed to be consistent with marked chronic inflammation. Review of the specimen at another institution revealed fragments of fibromuscular tissue; there were dense infiltrates of large, atypical-appearing lymphocytes and histiocyte-like cells with rare mitotic figures and extensive areas of necrosis and hemorrhage; the findings were considered suggestive of a malignant tumor. A complete blood count with a differential count was normal. Several weeks later microscopical examination of another biopsy specimen at a third institution disclosed a similar infiltration of striated muscle and fibrous tissue; immunoperoxidase stains showed a predominance of mature T lymphocytes, which were interpreted as chronic inflammatory cells. A DNA hybridization study showed no evidence of clonal B-cell or T-cell rearrangements.\nEight months before admission a physical examination revealed firm, enlarged tissue along the buccal mucosa behind the right upper incisor teeth and the right lower lip, with slight distortion of the lip; no leukoplakia or discharge was found, and no lymphadenopathy was detected; the physical examination was negative otherwise.\nOne month later an otolaryngologist found no abnormality except for the buccal process. An antibiotic was prescribed, and observation was advised. Four and a half months before entry laboratory studies included a normal hematocrit, hemoglobin, white-cell count, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, conjugated and total bilirubin, protein, albumin, globulin, serum aspartate aminotransferase, serum alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase, and radiographic study of the chest was reported to be negative. Two weeks later the otolaryngologist noted that the patient was having difficulty in smiling or whistling properly because of progressive swelling. Physical examination showed more extensive submucosal induration in the right lower lip, without loss of mucosal integrity; there was weakness of the lower third of the right side of the face with numbness of the lower two thirds of the face, including the right upper teeth. Additional imaging studies were advised but were not performed. A test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies was negative. Microscopical examination of another biopsy specimen revealed only squamous epithelial hyperplasia.\nTwo months before entry an oncology consultant found tenderness and nodularity in the right cheek, without definite mucosal or cutaneous lesions; no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly was found, and the lungs and heart were normal. Imaging studies were again suggested but were not performed. An empirical trial of acyclovir for one week followed by ketoconazole for one week was without effect; prednisone treatment (20 mg daily for one week) resulted in transitory minor shrinkage with a decrease in local discomfort. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nThe patient was a busboy in a restaurant. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily until a few weeks earlier and ingested little alcohol. There was no history of fever, chills, sweats, weight loss, anorexia, rash, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, change in bladder or bowel function, bleeding or bruising, animal bites, risk factors for HIV infection, use of chewing tobacco or snuff, or foreign travel.\nPhysical examination revealed normal vital signs. The physical findings were unchanged, except that the chin was indurated and the lips were more swollen.\nA urinalysis and the hematocrit, hemoglobin, white-cell count, and platelet count were normal; the differential count showed 56 percent neutrophils, 36 percent lymphocytes, and 8 percent monocytes. The prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and bleeding time were normal. The cholesterol was 214 mg per deciliter (5.5 mmol per liter). The urea nitrogen, glucose, bilirubin, calcium, protein, albumin, globulin, electrolytes, and alkaline phosphatase were normal.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Thomas G. Cropley[\\*](#FN1): In summary, this 22-year-old man had a 20-month history of slowly progressive, nodular submucosal swelling of the right upper and lower lips and right cheek, with eventual involvement of the chin. He remained well otherwise, and the results of laboratory evaluation were consistently normal.Three biopsies failed to yield a diagnosis. Infiltrates of lymphoid cells and histiocytes were observed, but no clonal lymphocytic proliferation could be identified by DNA hybridization. Empirical treatment with an antibiotic, with ketoconazole, and with acyclovir was unsuccessful. Systemic administration of corticosteroid seemed to help somewhat.Aside from the facial swelling, the only pertinent physical finding in this case was the subsequent development of numbness of the lower two thirds of the face and right upper teeth, which in view of the localized nature of the anesthesia probably was referable to the maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve, with weakness of the lower third of the face. Weakness of facial muscles, unaccompanied by evidence of weakness of more distant muscles, is seldom due to a lesion in the motor cortex or cortical fibers. Furthermore, there is no history of diplopia to suggest abducens palsy, a typical finding in patients with brain-stem lesions that cause damage to the nucleus of the facial nerve. Thus, lacking additional information from the case history I must conclude that this weakness was due either to destruction of facial muscle by the pathologic process or to facial-nerve palsy. I favor the latter for two reasons. First, the case history suggests that the entire lower third of the right side of the face was weak, although only a portion of that region was swollen, suggesting that facial muscles somewhat distant from the edematous area were involved. Second, there is clear evidence of involvement of the fifth cranial nerve, supporting the contention that the muscle findings may also have been due to a cranial neuropathy. The lower third of the face corresponds to the region subserved by the buccal and mandibular branches of the facial nerve.Thus, the initial differential diagnosis in this case is that of disorders that produce persistent solid facial swelling with associated cranial-nerve signs. The causes of solid facial edema are many ([Table 1](#t01))[1](#core-r001). How are we to sort through this list to arrive at a unifying diagnosis?The persistent nature of this patient's problem allows me to rule out transient phenomena such as urticaria and angioedema from the outset. This process was obviously not congenital, and we have no history of acne or rosacea. I shall not consider South American blastomycosis further, since there is no history of foreign travel. The absence of scarring, epidermal atrophy, or other evidence of superficial cutaneous involvement rules out two rare but important diseases that otherwise would merit consideration -- necrobiotic xanthogranuloma and the form of cutaneous tuberculosis known as lupus vulgaris.I must assume that the neurologic findings and the facial swelling were related, in view of their temporal and anatomical associations. Nevertheless, I shall ignore for the moment the existence of the cranial-nerve signs and exclude several disorders that produce progressive facial swelling reminiscent of this case.Recurrent facial erysipelas may result in persistent lymphedematous swelling of the affected part. Typically, the patients report repeated bouts of swelling with prominent pain, fever, and erythema[2](#core-r002). There is no such history in this case; the facial induration was progressive and virtually asymptomatic, without signs of acute infection. Facial edema and eosinophilia, a rare disorder first described in 1985,[3](#core-r003) is characterized by diffuse, nonpitting edema of the face associated with marked peripheral-blood eosinophilia. The edema is episodic initially but eventually becomes persistent. One of the cases described in the initial report was that of a woman who also had firm swelling of the buccal mucosa and tongue. The skin-biopsy findings consist of perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes admixed with small numbers of eosinophils. I shall exclude that diagnosis on the basis of the absence of tissue or peripheral eosinophilia in this case. Cheilitis glandularis apostematosa[4](#core-r004) is characterized by inflammation and hypertrophy of the minor salivary glands in the lower lip. Mildly tender, chronic lip swelling results, but involvement of the upper lip and buccal mucosa does not occur. Ascher's syndrome[5](#core-r005) is analogous to cheilitis glandularis apostematosa but affects the upper lip, producing nodular submucosal swelling, as in the case under discussion. However, the diagnosis of Ascher's syndrome requires the finding of blepharochalasis, which is not mentioned in the case record. Furthermore, inflammation of the accessory lacrimal glands and thyromegaly are frequently encountered in that disease and were likewise absent in this case. Finally, Crohn's disease involving the oral mucosa may result in progressive rubbery swelling of the buccal surfaces or the lips, or both. On histologic examination noncaseating granulomas are seen in the submucosa. Isolated nodular lip enlargement in Crohn's disease is referred to as \u201cgranulomatous cheilitis.\u201d Granulomatous cheilitis is infrequently the presenting manifestation of Crohn's disease, but in one reported case it preceded the diagnosis of perianal and colonic disease by seven years[6](#core-r006). The histologic findings of granulomatous cheilitis associated with Crohn's disease are essentially identical to those of idiopathic granulomatous cheilitis known as Miescher's cheilitis and the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, which I shall discuss later. However, orolabial Crohn's disease does not cause facial weakness or anesthesia, and I do not believe that this patient had Crohn's disease.I shall consider now the causes of solid facial swelling that may also result in cranial-nerve injury.Around the world, the most common disorder that might present with these findings is leprosy. Lepromatous leprosy and borderline leprosy are two forms of the disease that produce nodular thickening of the skin. Another form, diffuse lepromatous leprosy, results in diffuse facial swelling that resembles myxedema[7](#core-r007). Lepromatous leprosy is unlikely in this case, however, in view of the asymmetric and localized nature of the facial swelling. Borderline leprosy, on the other hand, produces solitary or regional skin lesions. Leprosy could result in this man's cranial-nerve signs. It often damages the facial nerve, most frequently its temporal and zygomatic branches. Involvement of the buccal and mandibular branches, which would have to be implicated in the case under discussion, however, is much less common[7](#core-r007). Trigeminal-nerve injury resulting from leprosy causes facial anesthesia, as in this case. It is important to note, though, that the nodular lesions of the lips and cheek should be anesthetic because of the granulomatous destruction of sensory-nerve branches within the nodules. Therefore, the slight tenderness of the nodules on two occasions in this patient militates strongly against the diagnosis of leprosy. We are told that the patient had not traveled outside the United States. Leprosy is endemic in one region of the United States, but unless I learn subsequently that he had lived in southwestern Louisiana I shall discard leprosy as a diagnostic possibility.Sarcoidosis deserves careful consideration in this case, principally because it may cause asymmetric subacute or chronic cranial-nerve involvement. Either a single cranial nerve, usually the facial nerve, or multiple nerves may be affected. Sarcoidosis frequently involves the skin as well. I doubt that this diagnosis could explain the findings in this patient, because the induration in this case involved the subcutaneous and submucosal tissue, not the skin or mucosa. Subcutaneous sarcoidosis is uncommon[8](#core-r008) and typically presents as nodules in the extremities. I would expect sarcoidal granulomas in the relatively thin tissue of the cheek and lips, in particular, to involve the overlying skin, producing characteristic shiny, purple-red nodules. No such skin lesions are described in this case, and three biopsies failed to reveal sarcoidal granulomas in the superficial subcutaneous or submucosal connective tissue. Heerfordt's syndrome, or uveoparotid fever, is a presentation of sarcoidosis associated with facial swelling and facial-nerve palsy, but the swelling is preauricular, occurring along with parotid enlargement, uveitis, and fever. At no point in this patient's history is there mention of fever, ocular symptoms, or parotid enlargement, and he clearly did not have Heerfordt's syndrome. The normal x-ray films of the chest also suggest that sarcoidosis is not the correct diagnosis.Finally, I shall discuss four disorders that come closest to explaining the features of this case -- lymphomatoid granulomatosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, lymphomas, including so-called centrofacial malignant granuloma, and the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Each may produce facial swelling or nodular subcutaneous lesions, and each may damage cranial nerves.Lymphomatoid granulomatosis[9](#core-r009) is a lymphoma-like multisystem disease that may result in chronic, progressive nodular swelling of the skin and rarely cranial neuropathy. Biopsy of involved skin or subcutaneous tissue reveals an infiltrate of large, atypical-appearing lymphocytes. The absence of constitutional symptoms or signs in this patient virtually eliminates this disorder as a diagnostic possibility, however. Persons with this disease are typically very ill, with weight loss, fever, malaise, myalgias, arthralgias, and respiratory symptoms dominating the clinical picture. X-ray films of the chest usually reveal bilateral pulmonary nodules, whereas a radiologic study of the chest was negative in this case.Wegener's granulomatosis also may present with unilateral cranial neuropathy and occasionally produces subcutaneous nodules. Could this patient have had a limited form of Wegener's granulomatosis? Even in a limited form of Wegener's granulomatosis,[10,11](#core-r010) however, some evidence of a systemic illness, such as a history of upper respiratory tract symptoms, evidence of pulmonary or renal involvement, a normochromic, normocytic anemia, or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, should be present. Furthermore, the extensive induration of subcutaneous tissue, as seen in this case, would almost invariably eventuate in infarction and ulceration of the overlying skin if it was caused by Wegener's granulomatosis.Localized lymphoma arising in the face is not unusual, with as many as 2 to 10 percent of all lymphomas presenting in the oral cavity[12](#core-r012). Orofacial lymphomas present most often as progressive infiltration of the tongue, lips, palate, or nasal structures, frequently with eventual ulceration. Sensory disturbances due to nerve destruction may occur, but damage to the facial nerve is rare. Facial swelling and cranial-nerve destruction also occur in some patients with centrofacial malignant granuloma, sometimes called \u201cdestructive midline granuloma\u201d[13](#core-r013). Recent lymphocyte immunophenotyping studies and analysis of T-cell-receptor gene rearrangements have suggested that this disorder is probably a T-cell lymphoma[13,14](#core-r013). Biopsy of affected tissue shows necrosis and large, atypical lymphocytes, as in the first biopsy specimen in this case. The principal arguments against either typical lymphoma or centrofacial malignant granuloma in the case under discussion are the negative lymphocyte immunophenotyping studies and the indolent nature of the disease, with no history of ulceration, bone destruction, pain, or systemic illness.The association of idiopathic solid facial swelling and facial-nerve palsy as a unique disorder was first described by Melkersson[15](#core-r015). Rosenthal[16](#core-r016) later reported the additional association of that condition with lingua plicata, or fissured tongue, thus creating the triad now known as the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The complete syndrome of progressive facial swelling, facial paralysis, and lingua plicata is seen in only 25 percent of the patients,[17](#core-r017) principally because a fissured tongue occurs in only 20 to 50 percent of them[17,18](#core-r017). Orofacial swelling is the sine qua non of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome; it precedes the other features of the syndrome in approximately 40 percent of the cases[17](#core-r017). The syndrome has no racial or sexual predilection[19](#core-r019). The mean age at onset in one series of 36 cases from the Mayo Clinic[17](#core-r017) was 33.2 years, with a range of 11 to 64 years. The syndrome is generally thought to be more common in Europe than in North America and indeed is considered rare on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. A paucity of case reports from other parts of the world suggests that the syndrome may be even more unusual elsewhere.The characteristic facial swelling most commonly affects the upper lip, with lower-lip and buccal swelling occurring almost as frequently. More extensive facial swelling, usually unilaterally involving the cheek or infraorbital tissue, is sometimes encountered, as is nodular swelling of the gingivae, palate, or tongue[17](#core-r017). Bouts of swelling that resolve after days or weeks initially characterize the disease in about 60 percent of the patients, but the episodes gradually give way to fixed facial edema in most cases[20](#core-r020). Facial paralysis indistinguishable from idiopathic Bell's palsy occurs in 50 to 90 percent of the cases[17,20](#core-r017). Like the swelling, paralysis may be episodic initially, sometimes involving first one side of the face and then the other. Simultaneous bilateral facial paralysis is apparently rare, however. Defects of taste sensation in the anterior two thirds of the tongue, referable to involvement of the lingual nerve, are frequently reported by the patients[17](#core-r017). Noteworthy in consideration of the case under discussion is the occasional involvement of other cranial nerves, particularly the trigeminal nerve, in the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. A spectrum of sensory disturbances of the face, including trigeminal neuralgia, paresthesias, and anesthesia, has been described[21](#core-r021). Dysfunction of the second and third cranial nerves as well as autonomic disturbances has also been reported. The prognosis for neurologic abnormalities in the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is exceedingly variable. The facial paralysis usually resolves without sequelae, but the neuropathy may persist or recur for years. Lingua plicata, or fissured tongue, is the least constant and least important component of the triad that constitutes this syndrome[17](#core-r017). The deep grooves on the dorsal surface of the tongue radiate from a longitudinal fissure in the midline. I should point out that a fissured tongue occurs in 5 percent of the population[22](#core-r022) and is thus considered a normal variant in the majority of the cases. With the exception of a mild lymphocytosis or minimal elevation of the sedimentation rate, both of which are found in only a minority of the patients,[17](#core-r017) the laboratory evaluation is typically negative.I believe that the case under discussion is an example of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The clinical presentation, including the absence of an associated systemic illness, is typical of this disorder, and the patient's age, although a bit younger than the mean age at onset, is certainly well within the general age range for this syndrome. That no mention was made of lingua plicata in the case history means little, since the fissured tongue is encountered in only a minority of the patients. The findings in the three biopsy specimens are consistent with the diagnosis in the sense that the microscopical findings in an early phase of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome are nonspecific. Initially, lymphohistiocytic infiltration about vessels and within the submucosal and subcutaneous tissue may be the only abnormality encountered. As the orofacial induration progresses, however, small, noncaseating granulomas form, frequently within the lumens of lymphatics[17,23,24](#core-r017). Lymphocytic atypia is not a feature of the syndrome, nor are necrosis and hemorrhage, as described in the first specimen. These findings might favor another diagnosis, such as lymphomatoid granulomatosis, lymphoma, or Wegener's granulomatosis, but the overall clinical picture does not fit those disorders well. Moreover the subsequent biopsies failed to confirm the presence of lymphoma cells or tissue necrosis, suggesting that these findings were a red herring. I believe that the diagnostic procedure was another biopsy of submucosal or subcutaneous tissue and suspect that well-formed granulomas were found, confirming the diagnosis of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.Dr. Nancy L. Harris: Dr. Fabian, will you comment on your impressions before the diagnostic procedure?Dr. Richard L. Fabian: I saw the patient relatively late in the course of his disease but did watch its progression. My initial diagnostic impression was lymphoma, because this clinical picture was similar to that I had observed in other patients with lymphoma in this region. Since previous biopsies had not been rewarding, I performed a more aggressive incisional biopsy when maximal induration of the lip and cheek was present.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Judith A. Ferry: The diagnostic procedure was a biopsy of the chin. Microscopical examination revealed a dense, diffuse cellular infiltrate, predominantly involving the reticular dermis ([Figure 1](#f01)) but extending into the subcutaneous fat, where only a few residual adipocytes could be recognized. High-power examination revealed a mixture of small and large atypical lymphoid cells with markedly irregular nuclei ([Figure 2](#f02)). Focally, the atypical cells involved adnexal structures, including sebaceous glands ([Figure 3](#f03)). Histiocytes with bland nuclear features surrounded degenerating fat cells, but no granulomas were identified. On the basis of routine histologic examination the lesion would be classified as malignant lymphoma, diffuse mixed small-cell and large-cell type, in the Working Formulation[25](#core-r025). We also performed immunoperoxidase staining of frozen sections to ascertain the lineage of the lymphoma. Staining was negative for B-cell-associated antigens. The tumor cells were CD3 (pan T-cell)-positive. They were also positive for CD7, a marker found on most T cells but usually not expressed by the neoplastic cells of mycosis fungoides. Staining was negative for another T-cell antigen, CD5. The loss of a pan-T-cell antigen indicates that the cells have an abnormal immunophenotype and supports the diagnosis of lymphoma. Most of the cells were of the cytotoxic-suppressor type (CD8), and there was background staining with an antibody for T helper (CD4) cells. Thus, our diagnosis was malignant lymphoma, diffuse mixed small-cell and large-cell type, of T-cell cytotoxic-suppressor type.A review of the first biopsy specimen showed a similar infiltrate. In addition, this specimen contained areas of necrosis and infiltration of several blood vessels by atypical lymphoid cells ([Figure 4](#f04)), which in our opinion warrants a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Perhaps the results of the DNA studies, which did not support a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, reflected a sampling artifact, as the histologically negative biopsy specimens may have, as well.T-cell lymphomas of a variety of types, including mycosis fungoides, adult T-cell lymphoma associated with type I human T-cell lymphotropic virus, angiocentric lymphoma, and other types of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, are characterized by frequent or even exclusive involvement of the skin and subcutis[26\u201331](#core-r026). The same is true of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (Ki-1-positive malignant lymphoma), although this tumor is not always of T-cell lineage[32](#core-r032). The lymphoma in this case was a non-mycosis fungoides type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, with features suggestive of angiocentric lymphoma in the first biopsy specimen.The lymphoma appeared to be localized to the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the face. In some series of cases of cutaneous lymphoma, excluding mycosis fungoides, the head-and-neck region is the site most commonly involved[33,34](#core-r033). The lymphoma had an abnormal T-cell immunophenotype in that there was loss of CD5 expression; aberrant immunophenotypes are very common among cutaneous T-cell lymphomas of both angiocentric and non-angiocentric types[26,27,35,36](#core-r026). In contrast to the majority of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, which are of T-helper type,[27,35,36](#core-r027) the lymphoma in this case was CD8-positive.In one series of cases of subcutaneous T-cell lymphomas, most of which were, as in this case, composed of a mixture of small and large atypical cells, the majority of the cases encountered through consultation were submitted with a benign diagnosis, as in this case, indicating the difficulties that may arise in the interpretation of cutaneous lymphomas involving the skin or subcutis[36](#core-r036).The prognosis of cutaneous lymphomas depends on the histologic type and stage of the disease. In general, patients with lymphoma confined to the skin, as in the patient under discussion, have a better prognosis than those who also have extracutaneous disease[31,33,37](#core-r031). An interesting exception is the series reported by Gonzalez et al.,[36](#core-r036) in which five of the eight patients with T-cell lymphoma that remained localized to the subcutaneous fat died of a hemophagocytic syndrome. Until the time of the diagnostic procedure this patient's illness had a relatively chronic course.Indolent, localized lymphomas like this one can be extraordinarily difficult to diagnose, and biopsies of them, especially of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, can be especially perplexing, not only because the cells themselves can be difficult to evaluate but also because there is usually an inflammatory response, and a superficial biopsy, as may have been performed initially in this case, often reveals only the inflammatory-cell infiltrate.Dr. Harris: Do you have a follow-up report, Dr. Amrein?Dr. Philip C. Amrein: We treated the patient with a commonly used combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. Since his response was not very brisk, we moved to another popular multiagent chemotherapy regimen (ProMACE-CytaBOM: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, and prednisone alternating with cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, and methotrexate). After this therapy had been administered for four months there were no visible or palpable lesions on the face, although right facial weakness remained and the patient could still feel a tiny nodule in the nasolabial fold. He will continue to receive the treatment for one more month before undergoing radiation therapy.Dr. Harris: I assume that staging studies were negative.Dr. Amrein: The bone marrow biopsy and computed tomographic scanning of the abdomen were negative. Scanning of the chest showed small lymph nodes, less than 1 cm in diameter, which were considered normal.\n",

      "question": "A 36-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of a pelvic mass.\nSeven years earlier a total abdominal hysterectomy was performed elsewhere because of pelvic pain of five days' duration and the finding of an enlarged uterus; pathological examination showed uterine leiomyomas. The pain persisted, and four years before entry bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed at the same hospital, with relief of pain; endometriosis was found in both ovaries. Treatment with conjugated estrogens was begun. Eleven months before entry the patient began to have almost constant dull pain in the left lower abdominal quadrant, together with low back pain, left sciatica, and deep dyspareunia. An ultrasonographic examination of the pelvis, performed elsewhere, revealed a complex mass, 3 cm, in the left side of the pelvis that involved the vaginal apex and the pelvic sidewall. Mefenamic acid was prescribed; the pain improved but continued.\nEight months before admission the patient came to this hospital, where examination disclosed that the abdomen was normal. There was fullness, with a suggestion of a cystic mass, to the left of the vaginal apex and in the region of the pelvic sidewall; the mucosa appeared normal, and no abnormality was found in the right side of the pelvis. Cytologic examination of a vaginal smear was negative for malignant-tumor cells; candida organisms were present. The administration of conjugated estrogens was discontinued, but the pain did not improve; it was noted that no hot flashes developed. At follow-up examination six weeks later examination of the abdomen remained negative. Pelvic examination showed a diffuse indurated, tender mass along the left pelvic sidewall, just above the vaginal apex. Danazol was prescribed, again without improvement, and was discontinued because of the development of headaches. Four months before entry the patient returned to the hospital. She continued to have back pain and deep dyspareunia. Vaginal examination again revealed a tender area above the vaginal vault, without other abnormalities. The estradiol was 63 pg per milliliter (230 pmol per liter). One month later the patient continued to have left-sided pain that was partially relieved by ibuprofen. She remained free of hot flashes, vaginal discharge, or frictional dyspareunia; deep dyspareunia persisted on the left side. Pelvic examination was unchanged. Two months before admission the patient stated that she had persistent pain, which was aggravated on deep penetration, and experienced burning dysesthesia after coitus. She denied vaginal bleeding or discharge and reported occasional minor hot flashes at night. Abdominal examination remained negative, and no inguinal lymphadenopathy was found. On vaginal examination the vault was unremarkable, but marked tenderness and a sensation of a mass were noted on the left side, with fullness of the pelvic sidewall. A pelvic ultrasonographic examination (\nFig. 1\n) showed that the uterus was absent and the vaginal cuff appeared normal; an oval structure in the left adnexal region, 4 by 5 by 2 cm, contained multiple cystic areas approximately 1 cm in diameter; no right ovary was seen; the right adnexal area was normal, and no free fluid was seen in the cul-de-sac. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nThe patient's menarche occurred at 16 years; her menses had been regular at intervals of 30 days and lasted for 7 days. Repeated vaginal cytologic examinations had shown no evidence of a malignant tumor. She had never been pregnant. There was no history of bowel dysfunction or obstruction, dysuria, or urgency of urination.\nThe temperature was 37\u00b0C, the pulse was 100, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared well. The head and neck were normal; no lymphadenopathy was found. The lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. Abdominal examination revealed that the bowel sounds were normal, and no organs or masses were palpated; there was mild tenderness in the left side of the abdomen, without rebound tenderness. The extremities were normal, and neurologic examination was negative.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 48.2 percent; the white-cell count was 8800, with 53 percent neutrophils, 40 percent lymphocytes, and 7 percent monocytes. The platelet count was 189,000. The prothrombin time was 10.5 seconds, with a control of 10.9 seconds. The urea nitrogen was 15 mg per 100 ml (5.4 mmol per liter), the glucose 85 mg per 100 ml (4.7 mmol per liter), and the bilirubin 0.4 mg per 100 ml (7 \u03bcmol per liter). An electrocardiogram revealed a normal rhythm at a rate of 75 and was within normal limits. An x-ray film of the chest was normal.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Jerome M. Federschneider\\*: Dr. Simeone, will you show us the ultrasound study?Dr. Joseph F. Simeone: Sagittal and transverse views through the pelvis ([Fig. 1](#f001)) reveal a left-sided complex structure, 4 by 4 by 2 cm. The lesion is predominantly solid but contains two discrete cystic areas. The location of this mass is in the left adnexal region or in the left side of the cul-de-sac. There is no uterus or right ovary.Dr. Federschneider: This patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy at the age of 29 years because of pelvic pain. The pathological examination revealed uterine leiomyomas. There was no mention of endometriosis or adhesions by the surgeon or the pathologist. I assume that the ovaries were inspected and found to be normal. She had persistent pelvic pain, and a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed at the age of 32 years. There was no mention of adhesions or difficulty of the surgical procedure. Endometriosis was found in both ovaries, and her pelvic pain was relieved. She was started on treatment with conjugated estrogens postoperatively.Endometriosis is diagnosed on pathological examination by the finding of endometrial glands andstroma outside the uterine cavity. The most popular theories of the histogenesis of endometriosis are retrograde tubal transport and coelomic metaplasia. Since the glands and stroma of endometriosis are usually functioning, steroid hormones are important in the pathogenesis of the disorder. The symptoms of endometriosis depend on the location of the lesion. Endometriosis has been associated with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, cyclic bowel disturbances, and bladder irritability and hematuria, but there may be no symptoms at all. Endometriosis may involve nerves and cause symptoms such as sciatica. The mass developed in this patient while she was on unopposed estrogens. In normal endometrium unopposed estrogen stimulates hyperplasia in a dose-and-time\u2013dependent fashion. Endometriotic lesions may have a similar pattern of hormone responsiveness, which would account for the development of the patient's mass while she was receiving unopposed estrogen. In the consideration of hormonal therapy of endometriosis the goal is the creation of an acyclic hypoestrogenic environment to produce atrophy of the endometriotic lesions.Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy usually results in regression of endometriotic lesions. However, the administration of estrogen may negate this effect. This patient was treated with unopposed conjugated estrogens of unknown dose immediately after the surgical procedure and before hot flashes could develop. She remained on this therapy for approximately three years. The estrogen therapy was discontinued when deep dyspareunia, low-back pain, left sciatica, and a left-sided pelvic mass developed.She had no hot flashes when the conjugated estrogen treatment was discontinued. The serum estradiol level was 63 pg per milliliter four months after the cessation of therapy. This value is elevated for a woman who has presumably undergone surgical menopause; I would have expected a value of less than 30 pg per milliliter. Since the patient's weight is not mentioned we have no idea if there was an excessive contribution to estrogen by peripheral aromatization of androgen. The elevated estrogen level raises the high probability of a functioning ovarian remnant in situ. The follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level was not measured, and that measurement is the best way to diagnose the menopause. Aksel et al.[1](#core-r001) showed that in 16 young cycling women who had undergone bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy the FSH level started to rise on the third postoperative day and reached menopausal levels within seven days. The estradiol values dropped precipitously on the first postoperative day and reached menopausal levels within two days. They also demonstrated that only 37.5 percent of the women had vasomotor symptoms during the hospital stay.One assumes that the entire left ovary and not just an endometrioma with a small portion of adjacent ovary was removed, leaving most of the ovary in situ. If a patient has severe endometriosis or adhesions involving the ovary it is advisable to wait three weeks before initiating estrogen therapy. If there is no residual ovarian tissue the patient will experience hot flashes and the serum FSH will be in the menopausal range.In 1970 Shemwell and Weed[2](#core-r002) performed bilateral oophorectomy and implanted cortical ovarian tissue on the lateral peritoneal surface of cats. At subsequent laparotomy they found that the ovarian cortex was cystic, with follicular activity. They also followed 10 patients with the ovarian-remnant syndrome in whom portions of ovarian cortex left behind after surgical removal of the ovaries functioned and sometimes became cystic. Five of the patients had endometriosis, and in one patient adenocarcinoma developed in a focus of endometriosis.The development of mesenteric cysts of ovarian-tissue origin due to incidental implantation and growth of minute portions of ovarian tissue in the pelvis or lower abdomen have been referred to as the mesenteric-cyst ovarian-implant syndrome.[3](#core-r003) The ovarian-remnant syndrome has been implicated in extrinsic compression of the ureter[4](#core-r004) and the large bowel.[3](#core-r003) Symmonds and Pettit[5](#core-r005) described the retroperitoneal surgical approach when one is dealing with ovaries that are adherent because of pelvic inflammation or endometriosis. Both the peritoneum and the adherent ovary should be excised.Two months before admission this patient experienced burning dysesthesia after coitus and occasional hot flashes at night. That was two months after a serum estradiol level of 63 pg per milliliter was found. No serum FSH level or estradiol level was measured at that time.In this case the data strongly suggest the presence of an ovarian remnant. The patient also had pathologically documented endometriosis. Since the mass developed while she was on estrogen therapy, I assume that it was not a functioning cyst. However, we do not know if the dose of the estrogen was enough to suppress ovulation. When evaluating the differential diagnosis one must consider an ovarian remnant as one would consider an entire ovary. The ultrasonographic findings are consistent with a retained ovary or remnant, a hemorrhagic cyst, an endometrioma, or a malignant tumor of the ovary. The possibility of an ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, another type of epithelial ovarian carcinoma, or a sarcoma arising in endometriosis or an ovarian remnant must be considered, but that occurrence would be uncommon in a 36-year-old woman.[6](#core-r006) One might have determined the CA-125 level, which may be minimally elevated in association with endometriosis[7](#core-r007); however, markedly elevated levels increase the suspicion of an epithelial ovarian cancer.[8](#core-r008)The patient had no symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings that would suggest an inflammatory process such as diverticulitis or some other bowel disorder. That possibility must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of a left-sided pelvic mass and pelvic pain.The issue of estrogen-replacement therapy in the care of women after total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with endometriosis is controversial. The stage of the endometriosis may govern the treatment. The optimal situation would be to withhold estrogen replacement for three to six months after the operation and then to start with 0.3 to 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen daily on a cyclic basis.[9](#core-r009) One would hope that the hypoestrogenic state for three to six months would cause regression of all the endometriotic lesions. Although that approach would theoretically be the best one, it is difficult to withhold estrogen therapy for this time span in premenopausal women with surgically induced menopause, who usually experience severe hot flashes. The addition of a progestogen for 10 to 14 days with the estrogen possibly will decrease the risk of the development of hyperplasia in an area of endometriosis. Clearly, the initiation of estrogen-replacement therapy in this setting must be decided on an individual basis. Medroxyprogesterone acetate has been used successfully to treat menopausal symptoms and may be tried initially in this setting without estrogen.[10](#core-r010) Furthermore, before the availability of danazol high-dose progestin therapy was the mainstay in the treatment of endometriosis to induce regression of endometriotic implants by producing an acyclic hypoestrogenic state.[11](#core-r011)This patient should have undergone an exploratory laparotomy for a definitive diagnosis and treatment. Saline washings should have been obtained upon entry into the peritoneal cavity in the event that the mass proved to be malignant. Careful upper abdominal exploration should have been carried out with particular attention to the diaphragm, omentum, and paraaortic lymph nodes. The mass should have been approached by a retroperitoneal dissection to identify the ureter and pelvic vessels and thereby avoid injury to those structures. The mass and involved peritoneum should have been removed intact if possible to reduce the risk of recurrence. The dissection on the left side may have been more complicated if the mass involved the sigmoid mesentery. Intraoperative pathological evaluation by frozen-section examination should have been performed to rule out the need for an additional operation.In summary, the differential diagnosis in this case includes an ovarian remnant with endometriosis or an ovarian neoplasm. Because of the low probability of a malignant tumor in this patient my diagnosis is the ovarian-remnant syndrome with endometriosis.Dr. Robert E. Scully: May we have the medical students' diagnosis, Dr. Kamitsuka?Dr. Paul F. Kamitsuka: The medical students considered several possibilities, including neoplasms, non-neoplastic cysts, and an abscess. They thought that the clinical picture of a tender, estrogen-secreting polycystic pelvic mass occurring after transabdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was most consistent with the ovarian-remnant syndrome, associated with multiple corpus luteum cysts. The possibility of a granulosa-cell tumor could not be excluded. They believed that an exploratory laparotomy was the diagnostic procedure performed.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Arlan F. Fuller, Jr.: The patient was referred to this hospital with the clinical information that she had persistent pelvic pain that had recurred after two surgical procedures. From the initial examination it was clear that there was a tender area high up above the vagina on the left side, which did not regress after the cessation of estrogen therapy and even after the administration of danazol. We thought that she probably had an ovarian remnant with persistent endometriosis as the source of her pain.We performed an exploration after an examination under anesthesia had confirmed the presence of a mass, approximately 8 by 4 by 4 cm, above the left vaginal vault on the pelvic sidewall. At the time of the laparotomy, examination of the upper abdomen was negative. There were dense adhesions involving the small bowel and large bowel within the pelvis, both in the central pelvis and at the left and right pelvic sidewalls. Several brown and black implants suggestive of endometriosis were present on the serosa of the large and small intestines. We carried out the exploration, as Dr. Federschneider indicated, with a retroperitoneal approach beginning on the left side and mobilizing the large bowel from the medial aspect of the mass, which appeared to be confluent with the pelvic sidewall and extended from the pelvic brim down to the base of the urinary bladder. By entering the retroperitoneum we were able to identify the ureter and protect it from injury, and then, since the mass was confluent with the pelvic sidewall, to excise all the pelvic peritoneum anterior to the ureter and superior to the bladder. We submitted the excised tissue, including a multicystic mass and a tubular structure, for frozen-section examination, which confirmed that it did not contain a malignant tumor. Because of concern that there might be tissue of similar nature on the contralateral side we performed the same procedure on the right side of the pelvis and found a smaller multicystic mass, which we also excised along with the adherent pelvic peritoneum.The postoperative course was benign. The patient stated that she had been free of pain on follow-up examination one year after the operation.Dr. Joanne K. Rutgers: The first specimen was a piece of tissue, 5 by 5 by 2 cm, that was recognizable as ovary, containing several brown and yellow cysts up to 2 cm in diameter. A segment of fallopian tube, 4 cm in length, was attached to the ovarian tissue. Microscopical examination revealed ovarian tissue containing follicle cysts, a corpus luteum cyst, and corpora albicantia ([Fig. 2](#f002) and [3](#f003)). Dense fibrous adhesions were present on the surface of the ovarian remnant. The fibrous tissue was extensively involved by endometriosis characterized by glands and stroma of the endometrial type ([Fig. 4](#f004)). There was focal mildly atypical hyperplasia with glandular crowding and budding ([Fig. 5](#f005)). The tissue from the right pelvic sidewall was 1 by 0.5 cm and red\u2013brown. Microscopical examination revealed an epithelium-lined cyst, evidence of old hemorrhage, and fibrosis, consistent with endometriosis.The case is an example of the ovarian-remnant syndrome, in which symptoms are ascribable to the presence of residual ovarian tissue after an assumed bilateral oophorectomy. In many cases the oophorectomy was technically difficult because of the presence of adhesions caused by endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or a previous abdominal operation. In this case the surgeons had noted dense adhesions at the prior operations; at the time of the salpingo-oophorectomy four years previously the ovaries were adherent to the bowel, and sharp dissection was necessary to remove them.Symptoms ascribable to an ovarian remnant generally occur within weeks to up to five years postoperatively. Pelvic pain that is sometimes cyclical is the most frequent symptom. Obstruction of the ureter[12,13](#core-r012) or small intestine[14](#core-r014) has also been reported. A mass is palpable in half the cases. Microscopical examination reveals ovarian tissue that usually contains a corpus luteum cyst and is surrounded by fibrous tissue. Hemorrhage into corpus luteum cysts probably accounts for the symptoms in these patients.[15](#core-r015) Endometriosis and neoplasms such as a cystadenofibroma[5](#core-r005) have also been found. The mildly atypical hyperplasia of the endometriosis in the patient under discussion was presumably secondary to the estrogen therapy. We agree with Dr. Federschneider that one has to be very careful about unopposed estrogen replacement in patients with a history of endometriosis, since we have seen several examples of malignant tumors, both adenocarcinomas and sarcomas, that arose in patients with endometriosis who had been on unopposed estrogen medication for several years.Dr. William J. Dowling: Was the postoperative estradiol level measured?Dr. Fuller: It was not measured. However, the patient had severe hot flashes, which indicated that all the ovarian tissue had been removed.I should also like to state that these operations can sometimes be exceedingly difficult because of adhesions of the ovary to the pelvic sidewall. It is necessary to mobilize the ureter and to resect all the associated peritoneum on the involved pelvic sidewall. If an individual surgeon is not familiar with the procedure and has difficulty with complete resection of the ovary, it is preferable to risk the chance of incomplete resection of the ovarian tissue than to risk the possibility of injury to either vascular or urologic structures on the pelvic sidewall.Dr. Scully: Dr. Fuller, what is your opinion about replacement therapy in a patient of this type? How are you treating this patient for the hot flashes? Dr. Fuller: One important question that arises in regard to estrogen-replacement therapy in patients of this type is whether the endometriotic tissue has been excised completely. If endometrial tissue remains, there is a small but real risk of the development of a malignant tumor within it if estrogen alone is administered. For that reason we have considered it appropriate to give estrogen and progesterone in a cyclic fashion to patients with residual endometrial tissue or endometriotic foci.Another difficult question in this type of case is whether estrogen-replacement therapy should begin immediately after the surgical procedure in patients who have evidence of residual endometriosis. This patient had multiple implants on the small and large bowel, which were only 1 to 2 mm in diameter but were easily recognizable because of their discoloration. For this reason we elected not to administer estrogen replacement therapy for the first three months, and in view of her past history she was willing to accept the hot flashes in exchange for relief of pain. When she returned for the three-month follow-up visit, I then initiated estrogen and progesterone therapy. The clinical criterion that I find most useful in deciding whether to treat such a patient is the presence or absence of residual pelvic tenderness, which might indicate active endometriosis. Since the examination was negative for tenderness, it was reasonable to begin the replacement therapy. However, as Dr. Federschneider indicated, it is important to assess each patient individually and evaluate the risks and benefits of estrogen-replacement therapy. We are aware of the problem of osteoporosis after the removal of the ovaries and the limitations of calcium intake in preventing its development as well as the increased risk of cardiovascular disease after bilateral oophorectomy in the premenopausal patient. These two complications are sufficiently serious to indicate the necessity for hormone-replacement therapy after oophorectomy in a young woman.A Physician: Dr. Fuller, will you comment on the use of total abdominal hysterectomy as treatment for pelvic pain of short duration in a patient?Dr. Fuller: There are many reasons for pelvic pain, and it is important to analyze them very carefully and discuss them with the patient before one resorts to removal of the uterus and adnexa. Diagnostic laparoscopic examination may identify the source of the pain and allow one to discuss the alternatives of medical and surgical therapy with the patient before one undertakes a major operation. Perhaps Dr. Federschneider has some comments in that regard as well.Dr. Federschneider: I agree with Dr. Fuller. It is very difficult to answer the question whether this patient, who was 29 years of age and had pelvic pain and uterine leiomyomas, required a hysterectomy and a subsequent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without knowing more about her symptoms at the time of those operations. Leiomyomas by themselves are not associated with pelvic pain unless they compress another structure, undergo degeneration, or obstruct the outflow of menstrual blood, causing dysmenorrhea. We usually perform a diagnostic procedure, such as a laparoscopic examination, in patients with pelvic pain and then proceed on the basis of the findings. If the diagnosis of endometriosis is made, therapy such as danazol should be tried to suppress the endometriosis and relieve the pelvic pain before surgical therapy is considered.\n",

      "question": "A sixty-year-old machine-shop foreman entered the hospital because of hematemesis.\nSince early childhood he had had attacks of bronchial asthma that were treated with epinephrine, aminophylline and a compound of theophylline, ephedrine and phenobarbital (Tedral). Six years before admission epigastric pain and vomiting developed, and a gastrointestinal series revealed a small sliding hiatus hernia and an ulcer crater within the apex of the duodenal cap (\nFig. 1\n). With an ulcer diet and antacid and ph\u00e9nobarbital therapy the symptoms remained quiescent until four months before admission, when pain in the epigastrium recurred, with intermittent vomiting and a sensation of epigastric fullness. The use of an antacid caused transient relief. During the month before entry vomiting occurred frequently after a large evening meal. On the day of admission he experienced severe, burning epigastric pain and vomited large quantities of coffee-grounds liquid. He had lost 14 pounds in weight in the past two months.\nPhysical examination revealed a wheezing, acutely ill man. No lymph nodes were palpable. The anteroposterior diameter of the chest was increased, with diminished diaphragmatic excursion, and diffuse expiratory wheezes were audible bilaterally. The heart was normal. The abdomen was relaxed, and no organs or masses were felt; there was localized epigastric tenderness. Rectal examination disclosed that the prostate gland was twice the normal size.\nThe temperature was 99.2\u00b0F., the pulse 100, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 120 systolic, 80 diastolic.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 50 per cent, and the white-cell count 13,000. The bleeding time was three minutes, the clotting time six minutes, and the clot retraction normal. A stool specimen gave a + guaiac test. The urea nitrogen was 34 mg., the calcium 8.8 mg., and the phosphorus 3.0 mg. per 100 ml. The sodium was 150 milliequiv., the potassium 2.0 milliequiv., the chloride 82 milliequiv., and the carbon dioxide 49 milliequiv. per liter. The prothrombin content was 82 per cent. Culture of the sputum yielded a normal throat flora. An x-ray him of the chest disclosed marked hyperaeration of the lungs, without atelectasis or infiltrations; the heart and mediastinum were normal. A gastrointestinal series showed a small axial hernia that was readily reducible. The stomach appeared normal except for a radiolucent filling defect, 2 cm. in diameter, that was observed by the fluoroscopist to slide back and forth between the distal portion of the gastric antrum and the duodenal cap, passing through a markedly widened pyloric canal (\nFig. 2\n).\nFluids were given parenterally, with supplemental potassium; ph\u00e9nobarbital and subcutaneously administered epinephrine were begun, and gastric suction was instituted. On the fourth hospital day the gastric tube was removed, and frequent feedings of milk were started. The gastric residual ranged between 30 and 200 ml. daily. The potassium rose to 3.4 milliequiv. per liter on the fifth hospital day. On the ninth hospital day endoscopic examination with a flexible fiber-optic gastroscope revealed a suggestion of a rounded mass that presented intermittently at the greater curvature aspect of the pyloric canal; no lesion was seen within the stomach. Later in the day, after the patient had received 2 small feedings, the gastric residual was 1700 ml. On the following day a second gastrointestinal series again disclosed a radiolucent filling defect that moved readily between the gastric antrum and duodenal cap and appeared to change in outline and size. Because of persistence of the asthmatic symptoms, on the eleventh hospital day prednisolone was begun in a dosage of 40 mg. daily, administered intramuscularly. During the next nine days the bronchospasm diminished to a stable but irreducible minimum.\nAn operation was performed on the twenty-first hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Stanley P. Bohrer\\*: This sixty-year-old man had a history of severe asthma, a peptic ulcer successfully treated six years previously and recent symptoms indicative of pyloric obstruction, with an acute episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding on the day of admission. On physical examination the abdomen was relaxed, with localized tenderness in the epigastrium. The laboratory findings were compatible with dehydration and metabolic hypokalemic, hypochloremic alkalosis as a result of the prolonged period of vomiting. Incidentally, the fact that a metabolic alkalosis developed provides the information that there was probably free acid in the stomach.The film of the chest reveals hyperinflation of both lungs consistent with asthma but is otherwise normal. The films from the gastrointestinal series performed six years before admission show a small hiatus hernia, scarring in the region of the apex of the duodenal cap and probably an ulcer crater. A radiolucent filling defect is suggested at the base of the cap, but it is probably just the basal fornix distended with air ([Fig. 1](#f001) *A*). The pylorus appears normal ([Fig. 1](#f001)B). The gastrointestinal series performed on admission reveals the elusive pyloric mass that was described by the endoscopist. The ill defined filling defect created by the mass in the region in the pylorus is seen in the base of the duodenal cap on some films ([Fig. 2](#f002) *A*) and in the pyloric antrum on others ([Fig. 2](#f002) *B*). On one film the process appears to be lying in the pyloric canal and extending into both the pyloric antrum and the base of the cap. It is not definitely seen on the films taken when the antrum was distended with gas. The hiatus hernia is unchanged. It is noteworthy that the pylorus, which appears normal on the films taken six years ago, is abnormally wide, over 2 cm. in diameter, on all the recent films. Widening of the pyloric canal can be produced by several mechanisms. An infiltrating lesion can be responsible for this appearance. However, if we study this area carefully on the films we find that the shape of the antrum seems to vary, being distended sometimes and contracted sometimes, whereas an infiltrating lesion does not change in contour. Although the antral mucosa is not well demonstrated on these films, we can see a few normal mucosal folds, which is another point against an infiltrating lesion in this region. A prolapsing tumor can also widen the pyloric canal. In addition, an abnormally wide pyloric canal may be seen in a patient with an ulcer of the duodenal cap or the pyloric regionthat causes contraction of the longitudinal muscles. That may well be the explanation in this case.Is there any more information about the endoscopic examination? I'm particularly interested in a description of the mucosa and the nature of the intermittent presentation of the mass as seen by the endoscopist. Did it present in a pulsatile fashion or with respiration or peristalsis, and did it then disappear into the wall of the stomach or into the duodenum? Any information along that line would be helpful.Dr. Robert H. Schapiro: When we performed the endoscopic examination we were surprised and somewhat chagrined to see no lesion in the stomach. An excellent view of the pylorus was obtained, and the mucosa in that region seemed completely normal. There was no sign of a stalk disappearing through the pyloric canal. I assumed that the process causing the filling defect described by the radiologist had slipped into the duodenum, and for that reason applied pressure to the abdomen in an attempt to induce it back into the stomach. The suggestion of a mass along the greater curvature of the pylorus was attributed to inward bulging of the gastric wall in response to that pressure.Dr. Bohrer: Was a differential white-cell count done? Specifically, was eosinophilia observed?Dr. Warren Point: The differential count on admission showed 85 per cent neutrophils. The eosinophil count was not striking at that time.Dr. Francis C. Lowell: One week after admission a count showed 976 eosinophils per cubic millimeter, which is a very high level.Dr. Bohrer: The radiographic differential diagnosis boils down to the cause of a filling defect moving between the pyloric antrum and the duodenal cap. A great number of lesions can produce this effect, probably as many or more than can produce miliary nodules in the lungs. I shall first try to eliminate several broad categories. From the fact that a discrete mass was not definitely seen with a gastroscope I think that an intraluminal abnormality such as a foreign body can be eliminated. The observation by the fluoroscopist that the lesion moved between the stomach and the duodenal cap helps to exclude a process completely extrinsic to the stomach, such as a lesion of the biliary tract, pancreas or gallbladder or an aneurysm of an adjacent artery.I am left with the large category of mucosal and extramucosal intramural lesions. A pedunculated adenomatous polyp is the most common lesion that prolapses between the pylorus and the duodenum. However, in view of the metabolic alkalosis and the symptomatic relief with an antacid I suspect that gastric acidity was present, whereas 85 per cent of the patients with prolapse of a polyp have achlorhydria. The negative endoscopic examination of the stomach also helps to rule out a polypoid lesion of this sort as well as a polypoid carcinoma. The possibility of carcinoid should also be considered, but that tumor is usually smaller and asymptomatic. Another mucosal lesion that probably can be eliminated on the basis of the gastroscopic findings is polypoid mucosal hypertrophy with prolapse. Although that entity can indeed produce the radiographic picture of a mass protruding into the duodenal region, the prolapsing mucosa does not usually extend to the apex of the cap, as is shown on these films, but stays at the base. Furthermore, some deformity can frequently be detected in the antral region when the mass is prolapsed into the duodenum,[1](#core-r001) and we don't see that change in this case.In my opinion, the radiographic and endoscopic findings are most consistent with an extra mucosal intramural lesion. In almost any extramucosal lesion in this area a pedicle may develop secondary to the peristaltic motion in the antral region. We don't see a pedicle on these x-ray films, and the question arises whether this degree of mobility of a mass between the antrum and the duodenal cap is possible without a pedicle. There are case reports[2](#core-r002) of extramucosal lesions with significant motility within the stomach. This patient had an unusually wide pylorus, possibly secondary to the previously demonstrated ulcer, and I think that a mobile extramucosal lesion could have slid between the antrum and the duodenal cap since the mucosa between the two is continuous, with the antral mucosa extending into the cap. So it is possible to explain the mobile lesion without postulating a stalk.Two salient clinical features in this case, the bleeding and the pyloric obstruction, do not help in differentiating the various types of extramucosal intramural lesion. Most of them can bleed by eroding the mucosa above them, and most of them can cause pyloric obstruction just by virtue of their size and position. I am impressed, however, by the apparent change in shape of the lesion. On some of the films it appears to be lying on a longitudinal axis, and on others it is on a more transverse axis. Also, on some films it appears lobulated and irregular, whereas on others the margins are relatively smooth. Therefore, I shall eliminate the extramucosal cystic lesions such as intestinal duplications, dermoid cysts and hydatid cysts. I would not expect a malignant tumor such as a primary adenocarcinoma, lymphoma or metastatic nodule to change shape, and, as I mentioned, the films show no evidence of infiltration. There is no good indication of a hematoma in the bowel wall or of mastocytosis. Could the process have been aberrant tissue such as a Brunnergland adenoma or aberrant pancreatic tissue? Aberrant pancreatic tissue is indeed most commonly found in the submucosa in the pyloric region and has an increased incidence in association with peptic ulcers. However, it is generally smaller and asymptomatic and should not change in shape.The next broad category to be considered is that of mesenchymal tumors, all of which can bleed, obstruct, be mobile or prolapse. Their incidence increases after the age of forty years, and 75 per cent of them arise in the pylorus.[3](#core-r003) It becomes somewhat of a guessing game from this point. The leiomyomas, neurogenic tumors, fibrogenic tumors and even osteomas and osteochondromas can probably be discarded because it is unlikely that their shape would change. There are two types of mesenchymal tumor to which I shall give serious consideration. Both types can be round, sessile, mobile, soft and irregular. One group comprises the blood vascular tumors, including angiomas, hemangiomas, endotheliomas and lymphangiomas. In the reported cases in which the tumor has been diagnosed preoperatively it has usually been recognized gastroscopically by the altered color of the mucosa overlying the tumor.[4](#core-r004) Such a tumor is a possibility in this case, but in the face of the negative gastroscopic findings I shall not put it at the top of the list. At this point I shall merely mention hemangiopericytoma, which can produce granulomatous proliferation, and shall return to it later. The other group of mesenchymal tumors to be discussed comprises the lipogenic tumors, primarily lipoma but also associated tumors such as fibrolipoma, myxoma and angiolipoma. Lipomas rarely occur in the stomach; less than 2 per cent of the benign gastric tumors are lipomas, and there are under 200 such cases in the literature.[4,5](#core-r004) Most of them have been single lesions in the antral submucosa, and in 50 to 60 per cent of the cases the tumor has ulcerated. These tumors are soft and can change their shape. This diagnosis would fit all the radiologic findings in this case. At this hospital between 1900 and 1949 there were 6 gastric lipomas, all of which were asymptomatic,[6](#core-r006) and in another series of 22 cases only 5 patients experienced symptoms.[7](#core-r007) Therefore, although a lipoma commonly bleeds and remains a diagnostic possibility, I am not convinced that it is the best choice in this case.One final category of extramucosal intramural lesions to be discussed is that of granulomatous processes, including tuberculosis, tertiary syphilis, mycoses and sarcoidosis. Most of these processes would not be expected to change shape. One entity in this category that has been reported to change in shape, exhibit mobility and prolapse into the duodenum is eosinophilic granuloma of the stomach,[7\u20139](#core-r007) also called gastric submucosal granuloma with eosinophilic infiltration and inflammatory fibroid polyp. This lesion, which was first described in 1949,[10](#core-r010) is submucosal or mucosal and occurs in the pylorus or the antrum. Mobility and prolapse have been observed, although those that have prolapsed have had a pedicle. It is poorly circumscribed and soft. Moreover, this granuloma is more common in patients with an ulcer[8](#core-r008) and in those with a history of allergy. Because of the latter association it has at times been called Loeffler's syndrome of the stomach and has been associated with eosinophilia. This patient did have eosinophilia, perhaps in relation to the asthma alone or perhaps because of this condition. In contrast to the eosinophilic granulomas seen in other parts of the body, which are made up of histiocytes or reticulum cells, this lesion is composed primarily of fibroblasts, with collagen tissue and a lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltrate, and contains cavities filled with lakes of eosinophilic fluid and apparently lined with endothelial cells. At first it was thought to be an endothelioma, but then it was realized that the lining cells actually were not endothelial cells but were pericytes outside the reticulum-staining membrane, and therefore this variant was called a hemangiopericytoma.[11,12](#core-r011) It is a soft-tissue tumor without a capsule and is malignant in 20 per cent of the cases in which it has occurred outside the stomach. There are no case reports of a malignant hemangiopericytoma in the stomach, and it is my understanding that when this process does occur in the stomach it is an allergic or inflammatory response rather than a neoplastic tumor, although the exact nature of the stimulus is unknown.In summary, this patient had a hiatus hernia, a scarred duodenal cap from a previous ulcer and a widened pyloric canal, probably related to the latter condition. I believe that he was bleeding from an extramucosal intramural mass. A number of diagnoses fit the clinical and radiographic features. I am most intrigued by the possibility of an eosinophilic granuloma of the stomach. Other extramucosal tumors such as a lipoma cannot be excluded, of course, but in view of the eosinophilia I shall place them on a lower echelon.Dr. Benjamin Castleman: Dr. Schatzki, what are your impressions?Dr. Richard Schatzki: As far as the evaluation of the change in shape is concerned, one has to be a little careful. The radiologic appearance of an object may be changed simply by different positioning of the object, with a consequent different radiologic projection. I am impressed by the fact that we do not see any deformity of the wall of the stomach on the spot films taken when the lesion was in the duodenum. When a gastric tumor protrudes into the duodenum it usually pulls the stomach wall with it. It seems probable that the process originated very close to the pylorus or perhaps in the pylorus and just bent a little, one W3V nr thp ntvirrDr. Point: I'd like to ask Dr. Bohrer to look again at the mass on the x-ray films to see if it reminds him of anything else.Dr. Bohrer: It does remind me of a case I saw only a few months ago in Ibadan, Nigeria. The films showed a filling defect that moved from the pylorus to the duodenum, as in this case. It was observed on successive examinations over a three-month period. That patient had swallowed a kola nut, which was producing intermittent obstruction. Considering the radiographic findings alone, I don't think that I can exclude an intraluminal lesion such as a nut, and, indeed, I had thought seriously about the diagnosis but found it hard to accept because the endoscopic findings seem to exclude an intraluminal mass.Dr. Schapiro: I think that we should place the endoscopic observations in the proper perspective, for the examination really provided only negative information. We visualized a normal antrum and pylorus and therefore assumed that the lesion was then in the duodenum, and it apparently was not attached to the gastric mucosa.Dr. Schatzki: I am intrigued by the change in shape. As I mentioned, a disk-like object has a completely different appearance if one looks at it edge on or face on. A prune stone is a characteristic example of that phenomenon. I remember a patient with a duodenal ulcer and 3 prune pits in the antrum, which could not pass because of the scarring in the cap.Dr. Bohrer: We do see narrowing at the apex of the duodenal cap on the radiographic examinations.Dr. Schatzki: There is definite narrowing. A prune stone or a similar object is never retained by a normal stomach, but the duodenal ulcer may well have prevented this patient from getting rid of such a foreign body.Dr. Castleman: What conclusion did the students reach?Dr. Hugh H. Kopald: They were perplexed. Most of them thought that this patient had a gastric polyp. Several made a diagnosis of a duodenal polyp, and 1 student suggested a gastric leiomyoma. Mrs. Fletcher discussed the case.Mrs. Suzanne W. Fletcher: My diagnosis was a benign adenomatous polyp arising in the pylorus and causing obstruction.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Castleman: Dr. Bartlett, will you tell us what you found at operation?Dr. Marshall K. Bartlett: The significant findings at laparotomy were narrowing of the duodenum, consistent with old ulcer disease, and a mass in the stomach. The mass, which was approximately 3 cm. in greatest diameter, was freely movable and hard and seemed to have fairly sharp edges. We decided that the proper treatment for the ulcer disease in this man, who was a fairly poor risk, was to perform a pyloroplasty and vagotomy. We used part of the pyloroplasty incision into the stomach as a gastrotomy to identify the mass in the stomach. The mass proved to be a foreign body, and after removing it we completed the pyloroplasty and vagotomy.Dr. Castleman: The object that Dr. Bartlett removed from the patient's stomach was indeed a prune stone, measuring 2.3 cm. in its widest diameter ([Fig. 3](#f003)).Dr. Schapiro: After the operation the patient remembered having swallowed the prune stone about six months previously.\n",

      "question": "First admission.\nA forty-four-year-old woman entered the hospital because of difficulty with speech.\nThree weeks earlier she awoke with slurred speech that persisted for several minutes. She was well thereafter until five days before admission, when slurring of the speech recurred and persisted, and the right hand became unsteady. During the next four days she used inappropriate names for common objects and attempted to use a hair curler as a lipstick.\nThere was no history of headache, head injury, seizure or disturbance of gait. She smoked 2 packages of cigarettes daily. The menses were normal.\nPhysical examination revealed a well developed woman who did not appear ill. The head and neck were normal. The lungs were clear; the heart was not enlarged, the rhythm was regular, and there were no murmurs. The abdomen was normal. Neurologic examination revealed disorientation in time and perseveration in speech and in action. She obeyed simple one-step commands but failed to execute all two-step commands. No abnormality of the cranial nerves was demonstrated. The tendon reflexes were symmetric, and the plantar responses were flexor; both carotid pulses were diminished.\nThe temperature was 100\u00b0F., the pulse 84, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 160 systolic, 90 diastolic.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 40 per cent, the white-cell count was normal, and the platelet count was 328,000. The glucose was 72 mg., and the urea nitrogen 14 mg. per 100 ml. The prothrombin content was 100 per cent. X-ray films of the chest and skull were normal. On the fourth hospital day a left carotid arteriographic study (\nFig. 1\n) disclosed complete occlusion of the middle cerebral artery at its origin, with small collateral vessels draining into it from the anterior cerebral group; the internal carotid and anterior cerebral arteries were normal. On the next day she was unable to speak, and a dense right hemiplegia was observed; the reflexes in the right arm and leg were absent, and a Babinski reflex was elicited on the right side. The blood pressure was 140 systolic, 80 diastolic. Impaired sensation of the right arm and leg and a diminished response to visual threat from the right side were demonstrated. Heparin and bishydroxycoumarin (Dicumarol) were administered.\nDuring the next three weeks the patient remained hemiplegic and was unable to express herself or understand verbal commands. The anticoagulant therapy was discontinued. On the twenty-eighth hospital day the temperature rose to 103\u00b0F., and x-ray films of the chest disclosed a small amount of fluid at the base of the right lung. After the administration of penicillin the temperature returned to normal. In the fifth week in the hospital right iliofemoral thrombophlebitis developed, and the anticoagulant therapy was resumed. During the next two weeks a large right pleural effusion appeared. An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 70; the T waves were flat in Lead 3 and upright but of low amplitude in Leads aVL, aVF and V\n1\nthrough V\n6\n; there was slight elevation of the ST segments in Leads V\n2\nand V\n3\n. A thoracentesis on the right side yielded 600 ml. of clear, straw-colored fluid with a protein content of 3.7 gm. per 100 ml.; microscopical examination showed no evidence of tumor cells, and a culture yielded no growth of bacteria. An x-ray film of the chest taken in the ninth hospital week showed a considerable decrease in the volume of fluid in the right pleural space. One week later a left carotid arteriographic study (\nFig. 2\n) disclosed marked narrowing of the internal carotid artery, with a diameter of 2 mm. up to the level of the carotid siphon and complete occlusion of the distal branches of the vessel.\nDuring the thirteenth week in the hospital a left frontal craniotomy was performed. The left anterior and middle cerebral arteries were pale, firm and pulseless. A longitudinal incision in the internal carotid artery just proximal to the bifurcation yielded yellowish material that could not be separated from the vessel wall. A probe passed through the anterior cerebral artery almost to the anterior communicating artery without producing a flow of blood; the probe was unable to pass a firm plaque at the origin of the middle cerebral artery. During the eighteenth week in the hospital the right iliofemoral thrombophlebitis recurred, and the anticoagulant therapy was resumed. In the twenty-fifth week the anticoagulant therapy was omitted, and the patient was discharged a week later.\nSecond admission\n(eight months later). In the interval she remained at home, receiving physical therapy to the hemiplegic extremities and taking no medication. Ten days before admission the right hand and forearm and the medial aspect of the distal half of the right upper arm suddenly became cyanotic. The cyanosis subsided within a few hours but recurred twice during the succeeding week.\nPhysical examination revealed an obese woman in no distress. The lungs, heart and abdomen were normal, and there was no peripheral edema. A pulsation was not palpable in the right brachial and radial arteries; examination of the left brachial and radial arteries and both carotid arteries showed a + pulse. The left posterior tibial pulse was absent; both femoral pulses were + +, and the right posterior tibial, both dorsalis pedis and both popliteal pulses were +. Neurologic examination demonstrated aphasia, right facial weakness and right hemiplegia.\nThe temperature was 98\u00b0F., the pulse 80, and the respirations 16. The blood pressure was 140 systolic, 80 diastolic.\nThe urine gave a trace test for protein, and the sediment contained 25 white cells per high-power field. The hemoglobin was 13.7 gm. per 100 ml.; the white-cell count was normal. The glucose was 78 mg., the urea nitrogen 7 mg., the cholesterol 282 mg., and the triglycerides 185 mg. per 100 ml. Lipoprotein electrophoresis revealed a slight decrease in the alpha\n1\nfraction, a moderate increase in the beta fraction and a marked increase in the pre-beta fraction. X-ray films of the chest disclosed slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and a streaky area of atelectasis at the base of the right lung; the lungs were otherwise clear, and the heart was not enlarged. An electrocardiogram showed no significant change from the previous tracing.\nWith anticoagulant therapy the cyanosis disappeared, but the pulses in the right upper extremity did not return. The patient was discharged on the thirteenth hospital day with instructions to continue the anticoagulant therapy at home.\nFinal admission\n(thirteen months later). Two months before entry persistent vaginal bleeding began. Two weeks before admission the anticoagulant therapy was omitted, but the bleeding persisted.\nPhysical examination revealed an obese woman who did not appear acutely ill. The lungs, heart and abdomen were normal. Pelvic and rectal examinations were unsatisfactory because of the obesity. The neurologic findings were unchanged. No pedal or popliteal pulse was palpable on either side; the brachial and radial pulses were absent on the right side but still present on the left.\nThe temperature was 98.6\u00b0F., the pulse 108, and the respirations 24. The blood pressure was 140 systolic, 80 diastolic.\nThe specimen of urine was contaminated with blood. The hemoglobin was 13.1 gm. per 100 ml.; the white-cell count was 9400, with a normal differential count. The glucose was 83 mg., and the urea nitrogen 10 mg. per 100 ml. X-ray films of the chest were normal.\nOn the second hospital day dilatation and curettage were performed; microscopical examination of the currettings revealed a late menstrual endometrium. Two days later she was transferred to the Rehabilitation Unit for physical therapy and speech training. On the twenty-fifth hospital day a generalized convulsive seizure occurred, and she became comatose and unresponsive to painful stimuli. The eyes were deviated to the right, the extremities were extended, and there was a bilateral Babinski sign. A lumbar puncture disclosed clear, colorless spinal fluid under a pressure of 280 mm.; the fluid contained no white cells and 2 red cells per cubic millimeter, and the protein content was 58 mg. per 100 ml. A tracheostomy was performed. The patient did not recover consciousness and died on the fortieth hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. David G. Freiman\\*: The neurologic symptoms that developed approximately two years before this woman's death are strongly suggestive of cerebral infarction involving the left motor area and its associated tracts. Transient episodes of slurred speech, such as the one that anticipated the persistent episode by several weeks, are very common in such cases and may be due to partial or temporary vascular occlusion antedating a more extensive and serious one. That there eventually was complete occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in this case was demonstrated by the carotid angiographic study performed on the fourth hospital day. The availability of the small collateral vessels from the anterior cerebral group probably explains why the infarction was not at first more extensive. On the next day, perhaps related in some way to the angiographic study, additional neurologic changes appeared, indicating extension of the infarction to involve further the sensory and motor cortex, the speech centers and the visual-motor associative tracts.Although the episode on the twenty-eighth hospital day might be ascribed to the onset of pneumonia in a hemiplegic patient, we cannot exclude the possibility that pulmonary infarction had occurred but was not obvious to the roentgenologist because of the presence of fluid. The fairly high protein content of the fluid, which suggests an exudate, is consistent with infarction, as is the absence of bacteria, although we must keep in mind the fact that the patient had been treated with penicillin. The development of overt thrombosis of the right iliofemoral venous system during the next few days makes pulmonary infarction even more likely.The extension of the occlusive process into the internalcarotid artery, which was demonstrated on the left carotid angiograms taken during the tenth week, was probably the basis of the neurologic changes that occurred immediately after the previous arteriographic study. The left frontal craniotomy, which presumably was performed in an attempt to restore patency to the occluded vessel, revealed that the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries were pale, firm and pulseless. The yellowish substance that was disclosed upon incision of the internal carotid artery may have been atheromatous but was probably thrombotic material that had by then undergone considerable organization and was adherent to the inner wall of the vessel. This observation does not, however, eliminate the possibility that atherosclerosis was associated with the thrombotic process.The episodes of cyanosis in the right upper extremity eight months after discharge from the hospital clearly indicate periodic interference with the circulation, and their transient character suggests that the collateral flow compensated for a single vascular occlusion or, more probably, multiple occlusions. The right brachial and radial pulses were not palpable at that time, but there is no way of determining when these arteries became occluded; it would be helpful to know whether the pulses had been felt before the transient episodes were recorded. Although these changes may have been due to multiple thromboses *in situ*, it is equally possible that a more proximal thrombus was discharging emboli that blocked the distal vessels momentarily but subsequently became dissolved or broken up, with re-establishment of the circulation. The diminution of the pulses in the other extremities as well as in the carotid arteries also suggests a more widespread phenomenon and perhaps a more central source of embolism in the heart or the aorta. The moderate elevation of the triglycerides in association with an increase in the beta and pre-beta fractions of the lipoproteins may be significant in this regard since a marked increase in the pre-beta fraction has been correlated by one investigator, at least,[1](#core-r001) with the presence of myocardial infarction. I am not sure that it is necessary to think in these terms, however, since the elevated beta lipoprotein and the slight increase in the plasma cholesterol are better correlated with atherosclerosis in general than with myocardial infarction specifically. In any event, the disappearance of the cyanosis when anticoagulant therapy was given, although possibly fortuitous, may have resulted from the inhibition of further thrombosis and subsequent embolization. The streaky area of atelectasis at the base of the right lung that was demonstrated at that time could very well represent a healed infarct.The prolonged vaginal bleeding that preceded the last admission may have been related to the anticoagulant therapy, even though it persisted for at least two weeks after that therapy had been discontinued. It is well known, however, that anticoagulants may bring to light potential sources of bleeding that do not otherwise become apparent. This patient may well have had a small uterine polyp or leiomyoma despite the negative curettage, or the bleeding may have been functional, perhaps related to the approaching menopause. The involvement of the peripheral vessels was more extensive at this time. The final episode on the twenty-fifth hospital day suggests an extension of the cerebral infarction, possibly to involve the other hemisphere and perhaps associated with cerebral edema and herniation.May we look at the x-ray films now?Dr. Alfred L. Weber: The initial films of the chest taken during the first admission are normal. The examination on the twenty-eighth hospital day reveals slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, with a diffuse, ill defined haziness at its medial and superior margins consistent with a small amount of fluid at the right-lung base. There is an abnormal density in the adjacent lung, and later films show considerable increase in this density, which obliterates the lower and lateral portions of the chest cavity.Dr. Freiman: Could the density be due to an infarct?Dr. Weber: It could be. The right lung is not well defined. The left lung is clear, and the left hilar shadow is normal.The film taken during the ninth hospital week shows a decrease in this density, and subsequent films from the first admission reveal further clearing. There is slight tenting of the right hemidiaphragm, probably as a result of adhesions, and the costophrenic sulcus is still partially obscured. The films of the chest taken during the second admission disclose a linear density in the right-lower-lung field, accompanied by obliteration of the right costophrenic sulcus. This density is consistent with an area of atelectasis or possibly fibrosis following infarction. The films of the chest taken on the final admission are normal.The first carotid arteriogram ([Fig. 1](#f001)) delineates clearly the origin of the internal carotid artery and its cervical portion with the siphon as well as the anterior cerebral artery and its branches, but there is complete occlusion at the origin of the middle cerebral artery. Some small vessels, probably of the Sylvian group, are visible. On a later film obtained during the same study there is more filling of the middle-cerebral-artery branches in the Sylvian group, probably because of collateral circulation from the anterior cerebral artery. The second carotid arteriographic study ([Fig. 2](#f002)) discloses diffuse narrowing of the internal carotid artery as far as the distal portion of the siphon. There is no filling of the intracranial branches. The visualized portion of the external carotid artery appears normal.Dr. Freiman: We are faced, then, with the problem of widespread obliterative vascular disease involving the cerebral and peripheral circulations in a relatively young woman. In such a case primary consideration must be given to atherosclerosis as a possible underlying cause. Certainly, severe atherosclerosis can occur in people who are even much younger, but it is important to keep in mind that atherosclerosis alone, in the sense of mural-plaque formation, is not usually the whole story in cases of occlusive vascular disease. It has, in fact, been stated that arteriosclerosis would not be a serious clinical disease were it not for the presence of the thrombosis that so frequently accompanies it. One may not necessarily agree that mural thrombi are the cause of more than a small proportion of atheromatous lesions, but there is abundant evidence to suggest that thrombosis is frequently responsible for the extension and enlargement of pre-existing plaques. Thrombi that are formed on the surfaces of such plaques or in direct association with them may, after becoming organized, result in significant luminal narrowing, which predisposes to further thrombosis. The latter may be precipitated by hemorrhage into the plaque, with disruption of the endothelium. or by stasis, particularly if the collateral circulation is inadequate. If one thinks of thrombosis in dynamic terms, with tendencies toward thrombosis being balanced by tendencies toward thrombolysis. one can conceive of many abnormalities of this homeostatic mechanism that might result in the changes observed in the present case. For example, an increased tendency to thrombosis associated with diminished lysis due to inadequacy of the lytic mechanisms, isolation of the thrombus from the circulation or other unknown factors could be expected to result in extensive organization of thrombi, producing the type of radiologic pattern that was demonstrated in the cerebral vessels. The reasons for the increased thrombotic tendency in this patient are not apparent, although its existence is well documented by the episodes of thrombosis of the iliofemoral veins as well as by the arterial occlusions. This case may well be an example of the so-called temporary thrombotic state, in which the activation of procoagulant factors in combination with stasis intermittently sets off thrombotic and often embolic episodes.[2](#core-r002)The second cause for the clinical picture in this case to which serious consideration must be given is embolism. The most likely origin of emboli capable of reaching both the cerebral and the peripheral circulations is mural thrombosis of the aorta or the heart. There is little evidence to implicate the heart or the coronary circulation in this patient. The electrocardiographic changes are nonspecific, but there can be extensive involvement of the coronary arteries or myocardial infarction in the absence of diagnostic changes in the electrocardiograms. We also know from post-mortem examinations that severe atherosclerosis of the coronary circulation, as well as myocardial infarction with mural thrombosis, may exist without obvious clinical manifestations. This was dramatically illustrated in the 3 cases of thromboangiitis obliterans in which an autopsy was performed in the original study by Buerger[3](#core-r003); 2 of the patients had mural thrombi in the heart, and the third had extensive thrombosis in the lower aorta. At the Beth Israel Hospital[4](#core-r004) postmortem examination of 4 patients with so-called thromboangiitis obliterans, ranging in age from thirty-four to forty-nine years at the time of death, demonstrated in 2 cases previously unsuspected mural thrombi in the heart, with evidence of extensive old myocardial infarction, and in the other 2 cases the presence of old infarcts in the spleen or kidneys, or both, attested to the occurrence of embolism.Emboli from an intravascular thrombus may consist of fragments of recent or of older unorganized or partially organized thrombi that have broken free, but it is also important to keep in mind the fact that areas of mural thrombosis or atherosclerosis constitute foreign surfaces within the vascular system and as such are predisposed to secondary surface thrombosis. In regions of rapid flow, as in the aorta and its larger branches, this surface material may consist predominantly of platelets together with some fibrin and leukocytes, and fragments of this accretion may, as Gunning and his co-workers[5](#core-r005) maintain, break off and reach the smaller vessels in the systemic circulation. Such platelet thrombi may temporarily occlude a larger branch before breaking up and moving into smaller twigs. When the cerebral vessels are involved the abnormality of cerebral activity may be restored to normal, at least transiently, as occurred in the case under discussion.This is certainly a case that would at one time have been considered in the category of cerebral Buerger's disease. Pale, firm vessels like those observed at the time of operation were described in the German literature thirty years ago as typical of this condition, but, as Dr. Fisher pointed out in his recent extensive review of the subject,[6](#core-r006) these vessels are filled with organized thrombi, perhaps as a result of stasis secondary to occlusions in the more proximal portions of the circulation. It is true that this was a relatively young patient, albeit a woman, that she was a heavy smoker, and that peripheral vascular disease was also present. It seems to me, however, that this is exactly the type of case that has resulted in considerable confusion in the literature on Buerger's disease or, as I prefer to think of it, Buerger's syndrome since it does not represent a single specific pathological entity in my opinion.However thromboangiitis obliterans may be classified, the possibility that some form of angiitis was the cause of the widespread thrombosis in this case must certainly be considered. Most types of angiitis, such as temporal arteritis, which is often generalized and doesn't always involve the temporal arteries, do not merit serious consideration. Mention should be made, however, of pulseless, or Takayasu's, disease, which tends to involve the aorta in the region of the arch and is associated with mural thrombosis. This disease is usually accompanied by many symptoms, sometimes suggestive of lupus erythematosus, as well as by fever and an elevated sedimentation rate, and the roentgenologist can generally demonstrate dilatation of the aorta and its branches. All these findings are absent in the present case, but it might be pointed out that at least one form of pulseless disease is probably a manifestation of atherosclerosis or thrombosis, or both.I believe that we are dealing with a case of widespread thrombotic occlusion of vessels, with some of the thrombi, at least, extensively organized. Although these occlusions may have been due to atherosclerosis, systemic embolism from a central source such as the aorta or the heart, perhaps followed by superimposed thrombosis, is a more likely possibility. In addition, there was peripheral venous thrombosis in the iliofemoral system and perhaps also in the axillary system, and pulmonary embolism and infarction probably occurred as well. Although it may be very difficult to recognize an old, healed pulmonary infarct at autopsy, the residua of old embolic episodes in the pulmonary arteries should be apparent. A recent study at the Beth Israel Hospital,[7](#core-r007) for example, revealed evidence of old or recent embolization in over 60 per cent of all adult post-mortem examinations; the findings included organized bands, strings and webs, which were observed in about a quarter of the cases. The incidence of infarction in these cases was, of course, very much less, about 15 per cent, because of the effective compensatory mechanisms in the lung. I suspect, therefore, that there were embolic traces within the pulmonary arteries in this case, regardless of whether old or recent pulmonary infarcts were demonstrable. Old infarcts may have been present in the kidneys and the spleen and certainly were found in the cerebral cortex.Dr. Jacob Lerman: Dr. Freiman, in the consideration of embolization as the cause of the picture, one might go a little further by postulating that a thrombus from a peripheral vein could go through a patent foramen ovale and give rise to diffuse systemic embolism.Dr. Freiman: That is certainly possible and does occasionally occur. Most pathologists would agree, however, that paradoxical embolization is very uncommon and tends to be overstressed as a potential cause of widespread systemic embolism.Dr. William F. McNeely: Have you ever seen evidence to suggest that pulmonary infarction may be followed by propagation of a thrombus within the contiguous pulmonary veins, setting up a source of embolization to the peripheral circulation?Dr. Freiman: We have looked for it on a number of occasions, but it is difficult to establish. There are a few reports[8](#core-r008) of cases in which the pulmonary veins were considered the source of emboli to the peripheral circulation, but they are rare.Mr. Jonathan E. Rhoads: The majority of the students today agreed with Dr. Freiman. I was impressed by the extent and severity of the arterial disease in this relatively young woman in the absence of diabetes mellitus and with very little hypertension, if any, and only slight elevation of the cholesterol level. Furthermore, the disease seemed to involve the arteries arising from the aortic arch. Therefore, I made the diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. C Miller Fisher: With the exception of the brain all the organs were unremarkable. The heart weighed 350 gm. but contained considerable epicardial fat. There were no mural thrombi, and the foramen ovale was probe-closed. The valves were not abnormal, and the coronary arteries were free of atherosclerosis. We found no evidence of pulmonary embolism or infarction, recent or old.The aorta ([Fig. 3](#f003)) was mildly atherosclerotic, with only scattered lipid streaks, but two reddish-gray thrombi, each 0.5 cm. in thickness and 1 cm. in diameter, were attached to its anterior wall, without obvious underlying ulcerated plaques; one lay in the lower thoracic portion, and the other distal to the renal arterial orifices. The renal arteries were free of atherosclerosis, and the iliac and femoral arteries were only minimally diseased. The right femoral vein was occluded by a red and white thrombus. The aortic arch was normal. However, the lumen of the innominate artery at its point of origin was narrowed by approximately 30 per cent by a yellow-orange plaque, 1 cm. in diameter, and the lumen of the right common carotid artery was also compromised, but to a lesser degree. The right subclavian artery was normal. The right axillary artery was occluded by a red thrombus, and the right brachial artery was occluded at the elbow by firm, white material. We found no atherosclerosis in these vessels. The left common carotid, subclavian and axillary arteries were normal, but a very recent thrombus lay loose in the left brachial artery. Examination of the right internal carotid artery revealed minimal atherosclerosis in the region of the sinus. The right middle cerebral artery was occluded by a recent, reddish-white, unorganized thrombus with an appearance consistent with an embolus. The left internal carotid artery was patent and almost free of atherosclerosis in the region of the sinus, but at the level of the petrous bone it was occluded by firm, white tissue that extended distally to fill the intracranial portion of the vessel as well as the middle cerebral and anterior cerebral branches. The latter were buried in dense scar tissue at the site of the craniotomy.Microscopical examination disclosed that the more distal aortic mural thrombus ([Fig. 4](#f004)) was composed superficially of fibrin, red cells, white cells and platelets, without an endothelial covering. The deeper layers stained like fibrin, but the fibers were thicker. At the junction of the thrombus with the underlying intima ([Fig. 5](#f005)) layers of hyaline tissue with the staining properties of collagen were intertwined with strands of fibrin. We found no striking evidence of organization as the process is usually understood, and there was no inkling of the process by which the transmutation of fibrin to collagen took place. A moderate amount of fat was present in the collagen at the fibrin-collagen interface and just beneath the collagen layer. There were no discrete atheromas. The aortic intima immediately beneath the thrombus was slightly thicker than elsewhere, and the media was not vascularized.The plaque in the innominate artery ([Fig. 6](#f006)) was similar to the aortic mural thrombus in that it was characterized by a thick layer of mural thrombus composed of fibrin, red cells and white cells, but in this vessel it overlay a plaque of intima greatly thickened by collagenlike tissue rich in lipid. The thrombotic deposit was undergoing organization peripherally. Deep in the thickened intima beneath the thrombus there was an island of material that stained like fibrin. Duguid[9](#core-r009) has suggested that such material represents the remnant of an incompletely organized mural thrombus. The occluding tissue in the right axillary artery consisted of a relatively recent thrombus with early organization. The wall of this artery, especially the outer media and the adventitia, was diffusely infiltrated by lymphocytes and plasma cells, with occasional polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The right brachial artery ([Fig. 7](#f007)) was occluded by an organized thrombus consisting of delicate fibrous tissue and several small endothelialized channels. There was no atherosclerosis or inflammatory infiltrate.The left internal carotid artery was occluded intracranially by an old organized thrombus. The right middle cerebral artery contained an unorganized thrombus made up of fibrin, platelets, red cells and white cells ([Fig. 8](#f008)). The vessel wall was normal. Examination of the brain ([Fig. 9](#f009)) revealed an extensive, old infarct. chiefly in the territory of the left anterior cerebral artery but also involving the deep middle cerebral territory and the lateral occipital lobe. There was a recent large, slightly hemorrhagic infarct in the region supplied by the right middle cerebral artery.An attempt at clinicopathological correlation in this case leaves many uncertainties. Various forms of arteritis such as the syphilitic, giant-cell or Takayasu types have been excluded. There was no obvious source of embolism in the heart, and the closed foramen ovale excludes crossed embolism. The first stroke developed in a stuttering fashion, suggesting thrombosis. However, an embolus to the left middle cerebral artery might have occurred, with the major intracranial circulation precariously maintained by collateral flow via the left anterior cerebral artery and the subarachnoid interarterial anastomoses that were demonstrated in the arteriograms. No source for it was found. The failure of the thrombus to lyse and disintegrate as most cerebral emboli do might be considered a point against embolism.The second and final stroke must have been the result of embolism to the right middle cerebral artery unless we conclude that a thrombotic occlusion occurred in a relatively normal vessel. The latter occurrence is usually regarded as unlikely, but in view of the deposition of mural thrombi on the relatively normal aortic intima in this case that possibility may stand further examination. The most likely source of an embolus is the mural thrombus on the innominate-artery plaque. Fragmentation of material from this site would explain not only the second stroke but also the occlusion of the right brachial artery, which can be attributed to embolism since there was no atherosclerosis of the axillary and brachial arteries on that side. The phenomenon of embolism from an atheromatous plaque in the carotid and the vertebral arteries has been described, and when the cerebral circulation has been involved it has been termed \"local embolism.\"[10](#core-r010) In this case there was no evidence of embolism in the spleen or kidneys, and the presence of pulses in the lower limbs at the time of the last admission rules out major persistent occlusion in those vessels.The problem is where in the whole realm of vascular disease the present findings belong. Are we dealing with a very special, rare or unique facet of vascular disease or only with a somewhat unusual manifestation of atherosclerosis? If for the purposes of argument it is assumed that atherosclerosis produces stenosis and ischemic damage by means of recurrent thrombotic deposits on the arterial lining that gradually become incorporated into the wall in the form of thickening, then in this case the thrombotic process far outstripped the incorporating process, leading to mural thrombotic excrescences that either occluded vessels directly or served as sources of embolism. On this basis the case finds a niche at one end of the spectrum of atherosclerotic vascular disease. A corollary to this thesis would be the postulation that a local or generalized disorder of coagulability underlay the changes. The term thrombophilia might be appropriate. Yet the patient was obese and smoked heavily, and although it was not stated in the case record she had a family history of myocardial infarction in the forties \u2014 all characteristic features of cases of atherosclerosis. A strong claim for a link between coagulability and atherosclerosis could thus be deduced. The failure of the emboli to undergo lysis might well reflect a disorder of one aspect of the in vivo coagulability mechanism. Dr. Edwin W. Salzman has told me that warfarin (Coumadin) therapy would probably not be effective in attenuating mural thrombosis of this type. We have seen a number of puzzling strokes in women in their forties who might well have had a condition similar to the one described in this case. Unfortunately, the pathological data are scanty. We shall scrutinize more closely other cases of premature atherosclerosis or, indeed, atherosclerosis at all ages in the hope that they will cast further light on this problem.\n",

      "question": "A 71-year-old, right-handed man was admitted to the hospital because of progressive muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing.\nThe patient had been well until one year earlier, when he had several bouts of pulmonary and paranasal-sinus infections that were treated with amoxicillin. Nine months before admission, his voice was becoming progressively softer and hyponasal. Two months later, muscle weakness developed in the arms and legs, especially on the right side, and subsequently worsened, with loss of muscle bulk. Five months before admission, the patient began to have falls because of a right footdrop, and he had occasional leg cramps. Painless dysphagia and difficulty in chewing subsequently developed.\nRadiography of the chest and a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study performed elsewhere showed normal findings. Routine blood chemical tests were normal except for an elevated IgM level. A radiographic study suggested an abnormal oral phase of deglutition. Electromyographic examination showed active denervation and chronic reinnervation changes in three limbs. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic at this hospital.\nThe patient was retired from a sedentary profession. He had been bitten by a tick five years earlier but had had no symptoms of Lyme disease. He had taken riluzole in the past. He had lost 7 kg in weight during recent months. He had had no exposure to toxic substances, sensory abnormalities, trauma, or visual problems. His father had had Alzheimer's disease, and his mother had died of breast cancer. One brother was healthy, and there was no family history of neuromuscular disease.\nTwo months before admission, examination at this hospital showed slightly slow, hyponasal speech. The patient could not remember dates or names of cities. There was mild bilateral facial weakness. The tongue was slightly atrophic, with fasciculations and slowed movements. The functions of the remaining cranial nerves, including extraocular movements, were intact. The arms and legs were weak, especially on the right side, with a marked footdrop. Weakness was greater in the deltoid and biceps muscles than in the triceps and distal muscles of the arms; both iliopsoas muscles were slightly weak. Muscle atrophy was evident in the right thumb. Muscle tone was normal, and no upper-motor-neuron signs were detected. The deep-tendon reflexes were + in the arms, ++ at the knees, and absent at the ankles; the plantar responses were flexor. Vibratory sensation was decreased in the feet; other sensory modalities were preserved. No ataxia was detected.\nA lumbar puncture was performed (\nTable 1\n). The results of hematologic and other laboratory tests are presented in\nTable 2\n. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a low-concentration band in the fast gamma region, identified as an IgM\u03ba M component; a very-low-concentration band in the fast gamma region, identified as an IgM\u03ba M component; and a very-low-concentration band in the slow gamma region, which was not identified. No Bence Jones protein was detected in a concentrated specimen of urine (by a factor of 50). A motor-neuropathy profile was obtained (\nTable 3\n). A blood test for antibodies to\nBorrelia burgdorferi\nwas negative.\nDuring the next two months, immune globulin was infused intravenously on two occasions, without a response. The patient's gait became worse, and his difficulty in swallowing food and liquids increased. Booster doses of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine were administered. The patient could not lift his head from the bed or move from a supine to a sitting position. If he tipped to either side, he could not recover his balance, and he fell several times. He could walk only after being positioned correctly. One day before admission, he fell down nine steps at home; evaluation at another hospital revealed no injuries. He was admitted to this hospital.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse was 72, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 110/65 mm Hg.\nOn neurologic examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and fluent, with a soft, hyponasal voice. He remembered two of three objects at five minutes. There was bilateral facial weakness, with wasting of the masseter muscles. The gag reflex was weak bilaterally. He could not protrude his tongue, which was atrophic, with fasciculations. The remaining cranial-nerve functions were preserved. There was marked wasting of the trunk and limb muscles. Muscle tone was normal; fasciculations (+) were present in the arms and legs. Muscle strength was 2/5 in the right hip flexors, 3/5 in the right hip extensors, 1/5 in the right anterior tibial muscle, and 3/5 in both triceps muscles; most other muscles, including the intrinsic hand muscles, were 4/5 bilaterally. Vibratory sensation was impaired in both legs; other sensory modalities were intact. Coordination was normal. The deep-tendon reflexes were ++ and equal, except that the ankle jerks were absent. The plantar responses were flexor. No frontal-release signs were detected.\nThe urine was normal. Laboratory tests were performed (\nTable 2\n). An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 80, with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Radiographs of the chest and abdomen showed normal findings. Pulmonary-function studies showed a mild, predominantly obstructive ventilatory defect. Motor-nerve studies revealed diffuse low amplitude of compound muscle action potentials and slow velocity; sensory-nerve action potentials could not be detected in the legs. The findings were consistent with the presence of a sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. David A. Chad[\\*](#FN1): At the time of his admission, this 71-year-old man had marked weakness and wasting of his muscles. The electromyogram confirmed the presence of a diffuse denervating disease by revealing active denervation and chronic reinnervation changes in three limbs. Although vibratory sensation was impaired in both legs and nerve-conduction studies revealed a sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy, the fact that the tendon reflexes were mostly spared and the predominance of distal and proximal limb and bulbar lower-motor-neuron findings indicate that the patient's disorder is a form of motor neuron disease with an associated polyneuropathy that contributed relatively little to his weakness.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the most common form of motor neuron disease of undetermined cause in adults, affects not only the anterior horn cells but also the corticospinal tracts, resulting in focal and multifocal weakness, atrophy, cramps, and fasciculations (lower-motor-neuron signs) and in spasticity with enhanced and pathologic reflexes (upper-motor-neuron signs).[1](#core-r001) Because upper-motor-neuron signs were absent in this patient, his disease does not meet the diagnostic criteria for classic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but the extensive lower-motor-neuron signs in the bulbar, cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral regions indicate a strong possibility that upper-motor-neuron signs might emerge over time. In fact, at a workshop in El Escorial, Spain, members of the World Federation of Neurology designated \u201csuspected amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\u201d as a diagnostic category that includes disorders characterized by \u201clower motor neuron signs in two or more regions.\u201d[2](#core-r002)As the disease progresses, patients with suspected amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may have signs of corticobulbar or corticospinal tract involvement, or the pathological manifestations of an upper-motor-neuron disorder may be observed at autopsy. For the purposes of this discussion, however, I shall refer to the patient's condition as a lower-motor-neuron syndrome or motor neuronopathy, acknowledging that the clinical features do not permit one to assign the primary abnormality to the motor-neuron cell body or to the peripheral motor nerve.[3](#core-r003) Indeed, in evaluating a patient with neuronopathy, it is critical to search for a diverse set of causes that may be contributing to the disorder rather than to conclude a priori that the diagnosis is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which progresses inexorably and for which current treatments can slow the pace of motor-neuron loss to only a minor degree.[1](#core-r001) Although this patient had been taking riluzole, the extensive diagnostic evaluation he underwent indicates that his physicians searched diligently for a potentially treatable condition.When the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is being considered, the evaluation consists of a stepwise process comprising three categories of investigation: electromyography, neuroimaging, and clinical laboratory testing ([Table 4](#t04)). I shall organize my discussion according to the conditions that might have simulated or caused this patient's motor neuronopathy ([Table 5](#t05)), basing the differential diagnosis on an anatomical classification of the levels of the motor unit. I will then consider disorders or laboratory abnormalities that disturb structure or function, or both, at each level. I have included an additional level \u2014 the lower motor neuron \u2014 which is more conceptual than anatomical and relates to disorders whose precise cellular target is not always ascertainable and might be motor neuron or motor fiber, or both.The history and findings on neurologic examination in this case rule out disorders of the neuromuscular junction. Muscle disease, especially inflammatory myopathy, may cause dysphagia and weakness of the proximal and distal limb muscles. The weakness may be asymmetric, particularly in patients with inclusion-body myositis,[4](#core-r004) and may include features of denervation and reinnervation on needle-electrode examination, but muscle disease does not cause weakness with atrophy and fasciculations.The nerve-root disorders of clinical importance are those due to metastatic tumor, infections, or diabetes. In metastatic disease, involvement of the cranial nerves and spinal nerve roots by neoplastic cells may cause a diffuse lower-motor-neuron type of weakness with increased levels of protein and IgM monoclonal proteins due to malignant cells in the cerebrospinal fluid.[5](#core-r005) In this case, however, the absence of confusion, headache, and limb pain; the negative findings on cytologic examination; and the normal findings on the cranial MRI scan make this diagnosis unlikely. I shall return to the relevance of cerebrospinal fluid M proteins.Infectious polyradiculopathy is seen in patients with syphilis, Lyme disease, herpes zoster, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. In the case under discussion, polyradiculopathy caused by Lyme disease merits serious consideration, especially since the patient had been bitten by a tick five years before the development of the neurologic disorder. Although he did not have overt cutaneous, articular, or cardiac manifestations of Lyme disease, a neurologic disorder could have evolved. Polyradiculopathy associated with Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete *B. burgdorferi*. Nerve-root abnormalities occur in both early and late stages of the disease. In the acute form of the disorder, severe radicular pain is followed by weakness, sensory loss, and hyporeflexia in the area of the involved roots, with an elevated protein concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid and mononuclear pleocytosis.[6](#core-r006) There is no indication, however, that this patient ever had such a syndrome. The chronic form of the disorder is best described as a Lyme disease\u2013associated polyradiculoneuropathy with mainly sensory manifestations resembling those of a toxic\u2013metabolic polyneuropathy. Although this patient had a polyneuropathy and the role of Lyme infection in its development cannot be ignored, late polyradiculoneuropathy associated with Lyme disease does not explain the patient's bulbar and spinal lower-motor-neuron type of weakness, especially in view of a negative test for antibodies to *B. burgdorferi*.Diabetic polyradiculopathy usually develops abruptly, with painful, asymmetric weakness of muscles served by the upper-lumbar nerve roots. In rare cases, the polyradiculopathy ultimately affects other muscle groups, even those innervated by cervical roots; it may become so extensive that profound generalized weakness develops, a condition termed diabetic cachexia.[7](#core-r007) An electromyogram may show widespread neurogenic changes, and a peripheral neuropathy is generally found, but diabetic polyradiculopathy is ruled out in this case by the apparent absence of diabetes and the presence of marked bulbar involvement.Bulbospinal neuronopathy is an X-linked disorder of the anterior horn cell that results in slowly progressive, symmetric weakness of the proximal muscle with cramps and atrophy but without upper-motor-neuron features.[8](#core-r008) Weakness involves the limb, facial, and bulbar muscles, and fasciculations are prominent in the perioral facial muscles and the tongue. The serum creatine kinase level tends to be elevated, and the electromyogram reveals a combination of fibrillation and fasciculation potentials as well as a sensory neuropathy.[9](#core-r009) The genetic basis is an unstable, increased number of trinucleotide repeats (CAG) in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene.[10](#core-r010) Although the clinical and neurophysiologic features of bulbospinal neuronopathy resemble the findings in this patient, his weakness developed more rapidly than that caused by bulbospinal neuronopathy.Both poliomyelitis and post-poliomyelitis progressive muscular atrophy cause diffuse lower-motor-neuron weakness. The former is now rare in the United States because of immunization programs, but it may be acquired by exposure to infants immunized with the live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine.[11](#core-r011) Poliomyelitis is a febrile illness with acute, asymmetric weakness, muscle pain and tenderness, pleocytosis, and an elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein level. Muscular atrophy occurs many years after acute poliomyelitis, with weakness developing insidiously.[12](#core-r012) In patients with post-poliomyelitis progressive muscular atrophy, the decline in muscle strength occurs at a rate of approximately 1 percent per year and is thought to result from the loss of axon terminals from reinnervated motor units. Neither disorder is consistent with the course of this patient's illness.Porphyric neuropathy and toxic neuropathy are motor-nerve disorders that may be considered in the differential diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Porphyria causes an acute motor neuropathy that affects the arms more than the legs, with associated encephalopathy and autonomic dysfunction.[13](#core-r013) The muscle weakness and atrophy caused by toxic motor neuropathies are associated with anemia and basophilic stippling in cases of lead poisoning[14](#core-r014) or with psychosis and ataxia in cases of mercury poisoning.[15](#core-r015)Of more relevance to this case is multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block. This disorder primarily affects men under the age of 45 years and is usually manifested as slowly progressive, painless, remarkably focal weakness and atrophy of the small muscles of the hand.[16](#core-r016) The weakness typically begins in one hand, progresses for a number of years, and then develops in the other hand. Clinical deficits correspond to the individual peripheral nerves that are affected and for years remain very restricted in their anatomical distribution. An acute presentation, however, has been described after *Campylobacter jejuni* enteritis,[17](#core-r017) and in one case, the disease progressed to quadriplegia within 12 months after its onset.[18](#core-r018) Humeral and shoulder-girdle muscles are involved less frequently, leg weakness is infrequent, and cranial-nerve involvement is very rare.[19](#core-r019) There is remarkable sparing of sensation even in areas of marked atrophy. The hallmark of this neuropathy is conduction block along short or focal segments of peripheral nerves that are not usually subject to compression or entrapment. Conduction block is defined as a decrease in motor amplitude and area by more than 50 percent across a standard segment, with the duration of motor amplitude increased by less than 30 percent.[20](#core-r020) The pathological correlate of persistent conduction block is probably focal demyelination, sometimes with the formation of \u201conion bulbs\u201d (histologic structures consisting of several layers of basal lamina, connective tissue, and Schwann cells surrounding a thinly myelinated axon, which indicate repeated bouts of demyelination and remyelination).[21](#core-r021) Other features, such as temporal dispersion, segmentally reduced motor-nerve conduction velocity, prolonged distal latencies, and prolonged F waves, have also been described.[22](#core-r022) An interesting finding is the presence of high titers of IgM antibodies of GM1 ganglioside (greater than 1:6400) in 60 to 80 percent of patients who have multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block.[23](#core-r023) Elevated titers of IgM antibodies to asialo-GM1 ganglioside have also been reported in such patients.[24](#core-r024) Gangliosides are acidic glycolipids composed of a lipid component, a carbohydrate moiety, and sialic acid ([Figure 1](#f01)).[25](#core-r025) According to the number and location of sialic acid residues, the gangliosides are designated GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GA1, but because GA1 lacks a sialic acid component, it is designated asialo-GM1.[25](#core-r025) The gangliosides reside in the outer layer of the neuronal plasma membrane, and GM1 is one of the most abundant. The observation that GM1 is expressed on paranodal myelin at the nodes of Ranvier is relevant to multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block.[26](#core-r026)The role of antiganglioside antibodies in the pathogenesis of multifocal motor neuropathy has been questioned, since about half the patients with this disorder have normal or almost normal antibody levels.[27](#core-r027) The antibodies, however, have been shown to bind to nodal and paranodal regions of peripheral nerve,[28](#core-r028) and in the presence of complement they may form antigen\u2013antibody complexes and thereby block sodium channels.[29](#core-r029)Multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, unlike motor neuron disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which it may resemble, is treatable, regardless of its exact pathogenesis. Most patients have a response to intravenously administered immune globulin[24,30](#core-r024) or cyclophosphamide.[16,31](#core-r016) Multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block was probably considered seriously in this case because of the extensive lower-motor-neuron signs with elevated titers of antiganglioside antibodies. In fact, the patient received two courses of intravenous immune globulin without any benefit. Although the lack of response to treatment does not rule out this disorder, the sine qua non of its diagnosis \u2014 conduction block \u2014 was not detected during the nerve conduction studies performed on admission. Moreover, the prominent atrophy and weakness of the bulbar muscles, marked involvement of the leg muscles, and rather rapid course of the disorder are not characteristic of multifocal motor neuropathy.The last group of disorders listed in [Table 5](#t05) targets one or more regions of the lower motor neuron \u2014 the perikaryon, the motor fiber, or both \u2014 and causes the clinical syndrome of neuronopathy. Although in some cases clinical findings and electrodiagnostic studies distinguish between parts of the lower motor neuron, in other cases localization remains indeterminate. These conditions may be associated with one or more of the following findings: paraproteinemia, antibodies to GM1 or asialo-GM1 ganglioside, and lymphoproliferative disorders.[32](#core-r032)A paraproteinemia-related motor neuronopathy has been reported in a patient with IgM\u03ba M protein who had the characteristic symptoms and signs of anterior-horn-cell disease, with weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations, in the presence of normal sensation.[33](#core-r033) Slowed nerve conduction velocities and a high cerebrospinal fluid protein level, however, suggested a peripheral neuropathy. At autopsy, the issue was resolved because there was no loss of anterior horn cells but instead a proximal, demyelinating radiculoneuropathy with central chromatolysis. This study led to investigations into the frequency of paraproteinemia in lower-motor-neuron syndromes and classic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and, most important, into whether the paraprotein has a pathogenic role in these neurologic disorders. It is now well established that paraproteinemia, detected by immunofixation electrophoresis, is present in 9 percent of patients with motor neuronopathy, including those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[34](#core-r034) However, the role of the immunoglobin in disease pathogenesis remains unclear.In some cases of monoclonal gammopathy, usually of the IgM type, there is antibody specificity for the gangliosides GM1, asialo-GM1, and GD1b, among others.[35](#core-r035) Indeed, several groups of investigators have reported elevated titers of antibodies to GM1 in patients with IgM monoclonal gammopathy associated with a motor neuronopathy and normal results of conduction studies.[26,36\u201339](#core-r026) The question of whether antibodies to gangliosides are pathogenic is of considerable importance and is relevant to the case under discussion. These antibodies bind to the motor neuron, motor axon, and neuromuscular junction, and they may therefore have a deleterious effect on the lower motor neuron[26](#core-r026) through direct damage of the anterior horn cells; retrograde transport from the neuromuscular junction to the cell body, where interference with neuronal function may occur; and injury to myelinated motor fibers. The improvement in some patients when immunotherapy reduces the serum concentration of IgM gangliosides provides support for the pathogenic role of antibodies to gangliosides.[36\u201338](#core-r036) Moreover, one patient with a progressive lower-motor-neuron syndrome and a high titer of antibodies to GM1 ganglioside as well as conduction block (which the patient under discussion did not have) was found at autopsy to have a predominantly proximal motor radiculoneuropathy with multifocal IgG and IgM deposits on nerve fibers and loss of motor neurons, indicating abnormalities throughout the lower motor neuron.[40](#core-r040)Finally, motor neuronopathies have been associated with lymphoproliferative diseases, including Hodgkin's disease, follicular-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, the POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes), angiocentric lymphoma, and Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia.[41,42](#core-r041) The frequency of lymphoproliferative disease in patients with motor neuron disease (including disorders of the lower motor neurons and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is 2.5 to 5 percent, as compared with a frequency of 0.5 percent in a general autopsy series.[41](#core-r041) Of interest in relation to this case is the finding in many reported cases that the combination of monoclonal paraproteinemia and high cerebrospinal fluid protein values (higher than 50 mg per deciliter) increases the likelihood of detecting lymphoproliferative disease, and the lymphoproliferative disease is sometimes accompanied by high titers of IgM antibodies to GM1 ganglioside.[41](#core-r041) These associations have led some investigators[41](#core-r041) to examine the bone marrow as part of the diagnostic evaluation of patients with motor neuron disease if a monoclonal protein is detected by immunofixation electrophoresis, if the cerebrospinal fluid protein level is higher than 75 mg per deciliter, if there is clinical or laboratory evidence of a lymphoproliferative disease, or if the motor neuron disease is restricted to the lower motor neurons.This patient's motor neuronopathy was associated with IgM\u03ba M proteins in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid as well as IgG\u03ba M proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid without an obvious serum counterpart, an elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration, and high titers of antibodies to asialo-GM1 ganglioside. The presence of apparently identical IgM\u03ba peaks in cerebrospinal fluid and serum suggests two possibilities. Either the permeability of the blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier was increased, allowing IgM\u03ba to pass from one fluid compartment to the other,[43](#core-r043) or there was intrathecal synthesis of IgM\u03ba by lymphoimmunoproliferative cells that had infiltrated the central nervous system.[5](#core-r005) The first possibility seems more likely in the light of the acellular cerebrospinal fluid, normal cranial MRI findings, and normal cytologic findings and is supported by the ratio of cerebrospinal fluid albumin to serum albumin, a measure of the permeability of the blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier to serum albumin. In this case, the ratio was 15.03, which is approximately four times the normal value.[43](#core-r043) However, the cause of the cerebrospinal fluid IgG\u03ba M protein is unclear.I believe that this patient had a motor neuronopathy associated with IgM\u03ba proteins in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid and that the antibody was probably specific for asialo-GM1 ganglioside. The nature of the association between the neurologic disorder and the immunologic abnormalities is uncertain. Although the clinical and laboratory abnormalities could occur independently, a cause-and-effect relation between the paraproteins and the clinical syndrome is suggested by the presence in the cerebrospinal fluid of immunoglobulins that are likely to have specificity for glycolipids in motor-neuron and motor axonal membranes and are therefore likely to have access to nerve roots and motor neurons. Furthermore, I believe that lymphoimmunoproliferative cells were responsible for elaborating the antibodies against neural elements. Although the patient did not appear to have definite clinical signs of a lymphoproliferative disorder such as hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, the previous pulmonary and paranasal-sinus infections, mild normocytic anemia, white-cell count in the low-normal range, and slightly elevated lactate dehydrogenase concentration are consistent with the presence of an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. Such a disorder may be occult and detectable only after bone marrow biopsy.[41](#core-r041)The diagnostic procedure was probably a bone marrow biopsy, which probably revealed a lymphoproliferative disease, the exact nature of which would be difficult to predict. From a statistical standpoint, Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is most likely, but the IgM paraproteinemia suggests that lymphocytoplasmoid cells were found, indicating the diagnosis of Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia. The clinicians would then have been able to administer specific chemotherapy for this lymphoproliferative disorder in the hope of at least arresting the progression of the neurologic disease and at best improving the outcome. Both results have been reported.[41](#core-r041)\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Nancy L. Harris: The diagnostic procedure was a bone marrow biopsy. The marrow was normocellular, with several moderate-sized aggregates of plasma cells and lymphocytes, which were mostly small and round, and in one area, a diffuse infiltrate of the same cell types ([Figure 2](#f02) and [Figure 3](#f03)).Flow cytometry showed a population of \u03ba-positive lymphoid cells that also expressed CD5 and CD23. This immunophenotype is diagnostic of a B-cell neoplasm and is consistent with the diagnosis of either B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. On the basis of the morphologic features, we made a diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, which corresponds to the clinical syndrome of Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia.Dr. Merit Cudkowicz: The plan was to treat the patient with plasma exchange and cyclophosphamide. He underwent the plasma exchange, but his respiratory status deteriorated rapidly. He declined ventilatory assistance and died a few weeks after the biopsy. No autopsy was performed.\n",

      "question": "First admission. A sixty-eight-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of weakness.\nHe had been well until two months previously, when crampy pain developed in both lower quadrants of the abdomen, accompanied by urinary frequency; the pain persisted for one week. Three weeks later he began to have episodic weakness of the legs, which gradually became constant, interfering with walking and preventing the climbing of stairs. Anorexia, decreased alertness and a loss of 8 pounds in weight occurred. Three days before admission, while sitting quietly in a car, he suddenly lost consciousness for five minutes.\nHe had smoked 1 package of cigarettes daily for forty years and had consumed between 10 and 15 glasses of beer daily for twenty years. For many years he had had an unproductive cough. There was no history of pain in the chest, dyspnea, edema, hemoptysis, night sweats or fever.\nPhysical examination revealed a sallow, sluggish man who appeared chronically ill. The skin was coarse and dry, and there was slight periorbital edema. Examination of the optic fundi showed only mild atherosclerotic changes. The thyroid gland was not enlarged. The heart and lungs were normal. The edge of the liver was felt 1 fingerbreadth below the right costal margin; the spleen was not enlarged. The testes were small and soft, and the prostate gland was normal. Neurologic examination revealed nystagmus on lateral gaze to either side, a wide-based gait and dysdiadochokinesia of both hands, particularly the left; the tendon reflexes were normal.\nThe temperature was 98\u00b0F., the pulse 80, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 120 systolic, 60 diastolic.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 30 per cent; the white-cell count was 6700, with 42 per cent neutrophils, 9 per cent band forms, 38 per cent lymphocytes, 7 per cent eosinophils and 4 per cent monocytes. The reticulocyte count was 1 per cent. The creatinine was 1.0 mg., the urea nitrogen 11 mg., the glucose 82 mg., the bilirubin 0.6 mg., the cholesterol 219 mg., the uric acid 4.4 mg., the calcium 9.2 mg., the phosphorus 4.1 mg., and the protein 7.5 gm. (the albumin 4.2 gm., and the globulin 3.3 gm.); the protein-bound iodine was 2.6 microgm., and the total iodine 3.0 microgm. per 100 ml. The sodium was 137 milliequiv., the potassium 4.3 milliequiv., and the bicarbonate 26 milliequiv. per liter. The glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) was 19 units, the alkaline phosphatase 2.4 Sigma units, and the prothrombin content 82 per cent. The basal metabolic rate was \u201423 per cent. The thyroidal radioiodine uptake was 7 per cent; after the administration of thyroid-stimulating hormone it rose to 61 per cent in twenty-four hours. Culture of the urine yielded no bacterial growth.\nX-ray films of the chest disclosed a patchy density in the apex of the left lung and minimal upper-lobe scarring, as well as atelectatic streaks in the left lower lobe and a small amount of pleural fluid in the left posterior gutter; the right side of the superior mediastinum was widened; the heart was normal. Films of the skull and abdomen were normal, and an intravenous pyelographic study and a barium-enema examination were negative. An electrocardiogram (\nFig. 1\n) showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 72 and moderately low voltage in all the leads; the T waves were inverted in Leads V\n1\nthrough V\n4\n, diphasic in Lead V\n5\nand of low amplitude in all the leads. An electroencephalographic study was negative. The serum vitamin B\n12\nlevel was 170 micromicrogm. per milliliter (normal, 200 to 500 micromicrogm.). A stool specimen gave a negative guaiac test. Tuberculin (first-strength PPD), blastomycin, coccidioidin and histoplasmin skin tests were negative. A brain scan after the injection of radioactive copper was negative. A bone-marrow aspirate disclosed megaloblastic hyperplasia.\nLevo-thyroxine, 100 microgm. daily, was administered. On the seventh hospital day a convulsive seizure occurred. Left-sided facial weakness, nystagmus on horizontal gaze, particularly to the right, ataxia and left-sided hypertonia, with a questionable left-sided hemiparesis, were observed. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid under a normal pressure, containing 2 red cells per cubic millimeter; the protein content was 70 mg. per 100 ml. The weakness did not improve, and nausea and vomiting developed. On the twelfth hospital day there was a brief episode of shaking in the left leg, accompanied by incontinence of urine but without loss of consciousness. A Babinski sign was elicited on the left side. The plasma cortisol level was 4.7 microgm. per 100 ml. (normal morning value, 5 to 20 microgm. ). In a twenty-four-hour collection of urine the pituitary gonadotropins were less than 7 rat units, and the 17-ketosteroids were 1.8 and 2.1 mg. After an intravenous infusion of ACTH the twenty-four-hour urinary excretion of 17-hydroxycorticoids was 5.7 mg.; during the administration of metyrapone (Metopirone, SU-4885) the twenty-four-hour urinary excretion of 17-hydroxycorticoids was 0.5 and 2.1 mg. Cortisone, 25 mg. daily, was begun, and transfusions of packed red cells were given. The temperature per rectum rose to 101 \u00b0F. On the twenty-eighth hospital day x-ray films of the chest with fluoroscopic study disclosed a pulsatile prominence in the right side of the superior mediastinum; the lung fields, the heart and the small left pleural effusion were unchanged. The patient was obtunded for several days but gradually improved, although a low-grade fever persisted. On the thirty-sixth hospital day an apical lordotic x-ray film of the chest (\nFig. 2\n) demonstrated a rounded density, 2 cm. in diameter, in the left upper lobe, without evidence of cavitation. An upper gastrointestinal series was normal except for a small hiatus hernia. He became afebrile and stronger and was discharged to a nursing home on the forty-third hospital day on a regimen of thyroid, 15 mg. daily, cortisone, 25 mg. daily, and vitamin B\n12\n, 100 microgm. intramuscularly once a month.\nFinal admission (nine days later). Intermittent vomiting continued in the interval. On the evening of admission a seizure occurred.\nPhysical examination revealed a drowsy, chronically ill man. The skin was dry but not thickened. Coarse rhonchi were audible at both lung bases. The heart was not enlarged; a Grade 1 systolic murmur was heard along the left sternal border. The liver and spleen were not felt; the bladder extended 3 fingerbreadths above the pubis. Neurologic examination disclosed nystagmus on right lateral gaze, a decreased left corneal reflex, weakness and impaired perception of touch and pinprick on the left side of the face, mild left hemiparesis, a leftsided grasp reflex and a bilateral Babinski reflex. Tests of cerebellar function were poorly performed. The tendon reflexes were more active on the left side than on the right.\nThe temperature was 99.4\u00b0F., the pulse 100, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 105 systolic, 65 diastolic.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 33 per cent; the white-cell count was 23,800, with 87 per cent neutrophils. The glucose was 100 mg., the urea nitrogen 9 mg., the cholesterol 199 mg., the iron 88 microgm., the protein-bound iodine 2.6 microgm., and the total iodine 3.0 microgm. per 100 ml. The sodium was 141 milliequiv., the potassium 4.1 milliequiv., and the bicarbonate 25 milliequiv. per liter. An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 80, with a slight increase in the voltage and less inversion of the precordial T waves in comparison with the previous tracing. X-ray films of the skull were normal. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid under a pressure of 220 mm., containing 320 red cells per cubic millimeter; the protein content was 75 mg. per 100 ml. An electroencephalographic study disclosed diffuse, random slowing, more marked on the left side.\nThe previous hormonal maintenance regimen was continued, with the addition of hydrocortisone given intravenously. On the sixth hospital day the temperature per rectum rose to 101.2\u00b0F. after an episode of hypotension, confusion and lethargy. An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 97; the T waves were inverted in Leads 3, aVF and V1 through V\n5\n. X-ray films of the chest disclosed elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, partial collapse of the left lower lobe and minimal widening of the left paraspinal gutter; there was a diffuse increase in density in the left upper lobe, with elevation of the left-lung hilus, and the superior mediastinum was widened on the right side. Specimens of gastric washings were taken for culture, and streptomycin, isoniazid, pyridoxine and methicillin (Staphcillin) were administered. On the following day the patient became alert. On the thirteenth hospital day edema of the left lower extremity developed abruptly, and on the next day bilateral common-femoral-vein ligation was performed; clots were found in both femoral veins. The twenty-four-hour urinary volume rose to a maximum of 8000 ml. In a specimen of urine the osmotic concentration was 135 milliosmoles, and in a simultaneous specimen of serum it was 310 milliosmoles per liter.\nDuring the sixth week in the hospital stool specimens gave + + + + guaiac tests. A gastrointestinal series showed no change. The temperature, which remained normal during the fourth through the sixth week in the hospital, rose to 100\u00b0F. on the fortieth hospital day. An x-ray film of the chest (Fig. 3) showed further increase in the left-upper-lobe density, with obliteration of the superior mediastinum on the left side; the right hilus was prominent. The patient was given penicillin, 6,000,000 units daily by vein, and pitressin tannate in oil subcutaneously. Culture of the sputum yielded an abundant growth of Staphylococcus aureus. The protein was 4.9 gm. (the albumin 2.6 gm., and the globulin 2.3 gm.) per 100 ml. Albumin was administered intravenously. On the fifty-first hospital day a lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid under a pressure of 600 mm.; the glucose was 87 mg., and the protein 67 mg. per 100 ml. A right-sided burr hole was performed, and a right ventricular tap yielded fluid under a pressure of 290 mm. On the following day wheezing respiration developed. On the fifty-third hospital day the patient became completely unresponsive and died a few hours later.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Jacob Lerman\\*: May we begin by reviewing the x-ray films?Dr. Walther T. Weylman: The intravenous pyelograms show no evidence of an abnormal mass in the abdomen, and the bones of the spine and pelvis appear normal. Both kidneys excrete fairly well, and the upper urinary tracts, ureters and bladder are normal. The barium-enema examination is negative, and I see no sign of a lesion in the cecum. The films of the skull are normal. The films from the gastrointestinal series reveal a small hiatus hernia; the stomach and duodenal bulb and loop are normal.The films of the chest taken on the first admission demonstrate several abnormalities. There are streaky markings at the base of the left lung, with indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm. In addition, the left posterior gutter is obliterated by a density that I interpret as fluid. The streaking extends into the left-upper-lung field, and a very faint density in this region partially overlies the anterior end of the first rib. The right side of the superior mediastinum appears widened. The heart is normal in size. On the films from the second examination, on the twenty-eighth hospital day, the lungs are unchanged. It is difficult to assess the right side of the superior mediastinum because of rotation. The fluoroscopist observed prominent pulsation in this area, but it is often impossible to differentiate intrinsic and transmitted pulsations. An apical lordotic view taken on the thirty-sixth hospital day ([Fig. 2](#f002)) displays the left apical lesion to the best advantage. Its superior and lateral margins are indistinct, but it appears rounded. I see no evidence of cavitation or calcification in it. The films of the chest taken on the final admission reveal a progression of the disease in the left upper lobe, where there is a hazy, homogeneous density that has the appearance of consolidation. There seems to be a density at the base of the left lung medially, obscuring and elevating the left leaf of the diaphragm, that may reflect lower-lobe atelectasis. Minimal paraspinal widening is visible on the left side.Dr. Benjamin Castleman: Could the haziness in the left upper lobe be just fluid coming up from below?Dr. Weylman: In that event one usually sees an associated pleural stripe laterally. This looks more like a process involving the lung itself. The final film ([Fig. 3](#f003)), taken on the fortieth hospital day, shows extension of the process to involve almost the entire left upper lobe. The aortic outline and the left side of the superior mediastinum are obliterated because of the position of the infiltrate adjacent to the mediastinum, and the cardiac border is less distinct, indicating probable involvement of the lingula. The right hilar shadow appears prominent, and in retrospect I think that slight fullness of the right hilus can be detected on the preceding examination. Widening of the right side of the superior mediastinum is again seen.Dr. Lerman: As far as the electrocardiograms are concerned, in the first tracing ([Fig. 1](#f001)) the voltage is low in all the leads, and the T waves are flat or inverted in Leads V1 through V4. This pattern is characteristic of hypothyroidism but is also seen with pericarditis. In the first tracing taken on the final admission the voltage is a little higher, and the T waves in the precordial leads are higher or less inverted, indicating improvement in the hypothyroid state with thyroid therapy. The final tracing, which was taken after an episode of hypotension, reveals inversion of the T waves in Leads 3, aVF and V1 through V5, suggesting ischemia of the inferior and anterior portions of the myocardium.Since this patient was a moderate smoker with a chronic cough the radiologic demonstration of an abnormal density in the lung immediately raises the question of a pulmonary neoplasm. He had symptoms during the two months before coming to the hospital, accompanied by signs of a neurologic disturbance. The event that immediately preceded admission was a short period of unconsciousness. The finding of a palpable liver and small testes in a man with chronic alcoholism makes one think of cirrhosis, but the spleen was not enlarged, ascites was absent, and there was no evidence of collateral circulation. The moderately low hematocrit, the low vitamin B12 level and the megaloblastic bone marrow suggest that he had pernicious anemia or a primary macrocytic anemia. The results of the various tests of thyroid function point to a diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism, which was later confirmed by other tests indicating pituitary damage. The changes shown on the x-ray films also raise the possibility of tuberculosis, but the negative tuberculin skin test in the face of such extensive pulmonary disease argues against it. The suggestion of involvement of lymph nodes in the superior mediastinum brings the possibility of a malignant tumor into focus.After six days of treatment with thyroxine a convulsion occurred, followed by progressive left hemiparesis. The elevation of the cerebrospinal-fluid protein was greater than can be explained by myxedema alone, particularly after almost a week of treatment, and therefore suggests a space-occupying lesion in the brain. The low level of follicle-stimulating hormone and the small testes constitute evidence of hypopituitarism, and I regard the observation of a normal prostate gland at this age as an indication of diminished gonadotropic function. The decreased urinary excretion of 17-ketosteroids and 17-hydroxycorticoids and the failure of the latter to respond to SU-4885 indicate a lack of adrenotropic hormone in the pituitary gland. I should mention that the basis of this test is the fact that SU-4885 inhibits the action of the 11-beta-hydroxylase enzymes so that the 11-desoxycorticoids are not reduced to cortisol, and the resulting drop in the plasma cortisol level stimulates ACTH production. Failure of response is an indication of lack of ACTH reserve in the pituitary gland.The final admission was precipitated by another seizure. The left hemiplegia was more advanced, and there was evidence of bilateral cerebral disease in addition to cerebellar changes. Although the hypothyroidism had improved, as indicated by the texture of the skin and the electrocardiographic pattern, the protein-bound iodine level was unchanged, and the cerebrospinal-fluid protein level was still high. The diffusely abnormal electroencephalogram confirmed the presence of multiple lesions in the brain. There was an episode of hypotension, followed by electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia. Subsequently, a pneumonic process developed, and *Staph*. aureus was grown from the sputum. Although the diagnosis of tuberculosis was apparently suspected since the patient was given antituberculous treatment, the appearance of the lesion on the x-ray films bears more resemblance to straightforward *Staph*. aureus pneumonia. The terminal event was marked by hypoproteinemia, increasing intracranial pressure, left ventricular failure and coma.It seems clear that this patient had disease involving several systems. He had hypopituitarism with associated hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, hypoadrenocorticism and, subsequently, diabetes insipidus. I assume that a macrocytic anemia was also a feature of his illness. There was a progressive disorder of the central nervous system that resulted in left hemiplegia, a cerebellar disturbance, seizures and coma. The lungs were involved by infection, infarction or tumor, or all three. In addition, peripheral venous thrombosis occurred. These processes may have been unrelated to one another, partly related or completely related. I shall attempt to interrelate them.Macrocytic anemia and primary hypothyroidism are frequently associated because achlorhydria is very common in patients with myxedema and may produce a nutritional disturbance, sometimes leading to pernicious anemia. Secondary hypothyroidism presumably can be associated with a macrocytic anemia for the same reason and might be the explanation of the anemia in this case, although there is no mention of achlorhydria. The pulmonary findings might be ascribed to emboli from the leg veins, with *Staph. aureus* bronchopneumonia as a terminal complication. Can the Central-nervous-system picture be explained on the basis of emboli? One of my favorite diagnoses is embolism from peripheral thrombi via a patent foramen ovale, but I am afraid that it is not applicable to this case. Because of the Grade 1 systolic murmur one might suspect endocarditis as the source of emboli. However, there is no other sign of endocarditis. Another possibility is embolism from a mural thrombus overlying a myocardial infarct, but the evidence of myocardial ischemia appeared only late in the course. The absence of blood and xanthochromia in the spinal fluid also argues against embolic infarction. One could postulate that multiple cerebrovascular thrombi were responsible for the neurologic findings. It is also possible that the hypopituitarism can be accounted for on the same basis, since cavernous-sinus thrombosis on rare occasions is the cause of hypopituitarism. Pursuing that hypothesis, I would have to postulate that a strategically located thrombus caused infarction of either the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland or the adjacent hypothalamus on one occasion, and that another infarct subsequently destroyed either the posterior pituitary lobe or the adjacent hypothalamus to produce diabetes insipidus. That possibility seems remote, and I have never encountered such a case. The most important bits of evidence against embolic or thrombotic infarction as an explanation for the neurologic deficits are the persistent elevation of the cerebrospinal-fluid protein and the progressive increase in the intracranial pressure. Vascular thrombosis may raise the cerebrospinal-fluid pressure temporarily, and emboli do so more often, but the pressure almost invariably falls to a normal level with time. I am forced to exclude cerebrovascular thrombosis or embolism as the cause of either the cerebral damage or the hypopituitarism. Granulomatous processes such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, syphilis and Hand\u2013Sch\u00fcller\u2013Christian disease can produce hypopituitarism by involvement of the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus. I have seen 1 child with hypopituitarism due to Hand\u2013Sch\u00fcller\u2013Christian disease. There is very little to substantiate a diagnosis of any of these entities, however.Therefore, I am left with a diagnosis of a space-occupying lesion, either primary or secondary, to account for the neurologic disease as well as the hypopituitarism. The progressive course the recurrent nausea, vomiting and fever and the convulsions favor a neoplasm. A primary tumor of the pituitary gland producing hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus should be manifested by evidence of destruction of the sella and visual-field defects. I assume that the visual fields were normal, and the x-ray films demonstrate that the sella was not destroyed. A primary tumor such as a glioma or a sarcoma elsewhere in the brain would have led to increased intracranial pressure and localizing signs early in the course of the disease if it had been the major cause of the neurologic deficits. It is extremely difficult to rule out a primary brain tumor in this case, and apparently it was suspected since a burr hole was made. However, primary tumors, except for those located in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, seldom, if ever, produce hypopituitarism. In the extensive series of brain tumors described by Cushing[1](#core-r001) there is no report of hypopituitarism except in the cases in which the primary tumor involved the pituitary area. Perhaps I should mention a meningioma and a subdural hematoma as possible causes of the neurologic picture in this case, but they, too, produce a high cerebrospinal-fluid pressure early in the course of the disease, with relatively little change in the cerebrospinal-fluid protein and no endocrine disturbance. I doubt if either is ever responsible for pituitary disease.Metastatic tumor is the most likely diagnosis, and the gastrointestinal tract should be considered among the possible sources in view of the positive guaiac stool tests. Although a gastric origin must be suspected since macrocytic anemia is frequently associated with carcinoma of the stomach, that diagnosis is unlikely because of the lack of symptoms and the two normal gastrointestinal series. Likewise, the negative barium-enema examination in all probability excludes the large bowel as a source of metastases, and a renal carcinoma is eliminated by the negative intravenous pyelographic study. Lymphoma seldom spreads to the brain. The most logical explanation, it seems to me, is metastases from the lung. The rounded appearance of the lesion in the left upper lobe, the widening of the superior mediastinum and the prominence of the right-lung hilus all point to a neoplasm in the lung. Moreover, such tumors not infrequently metastasize to the brain, and a small focus of tumor can either damage the pituitary gland without destroying the bone or impinge upon the hypothalamus to produce hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. I am forced to conclude that this patient had a carcinoma of the lung that metastasized to the central nervous system, with involvement of the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus resulting in hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, hypoadrenocorticism and, finally, diabetes insipidus. There was an associated megaloblastic anemia. In addition, he had peripheral venous thrombosis, pulmonary emboli and a terminal *Staph*. aureus pneumonia.Dr. Frank F. Davidoff: Does the cerebrospinal-fluid protein rise as high and as often with secondary myxedema as it does with primary myxedema?Dr. Lerman: The usual patient with hypopituitarism suffers from myxedema of a mild form, with the cerebrospinal-fluid protein in the range of 40 to 50 mg. per 100 ml. In an occasional case the myxedema is as severe as in patients with primary myxedema, and the cerebrospinal-fluid protein may therefore be high.Dr. Farahe Maloof: In studies done in 1929 Thompson and his co-workers[2](#core-r002) found that when thyroid therapy was given to patients with myxedema and an elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid about six weeks were required before the protein value returned to normal. The fact that the protein level remained elevated in this patient despite the thyroid therapy probably is an indication that he had something more than just myxedema, as inferred by Dr. Lerman.Dr. Hibbard E. Williams: Dr. Richardson, is this clinical picture consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy? I do not believe that the patient had that disease, but it might be considered in this case.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The duration and course of the illness are consistent with it, but the high cerebrospinal-fluid pressure and the high protein content are not and, in fact, would be very unusual with that condition.Dr. Castleman: Dr. Ebert, what is your opinion?Dr. Robert H. Ebert: I agree with Dr. Lerman's formulation. The most likely cause of the pulmonary disease, which started with relatively small lesions and progressed to hilar and mediastinal involvement, is an anaplastic carcinoma of the lung. It is not unusual for such a tumor to be manifested first by its metastases, and, as Dr. Lerman stated, metastases to the brain are very common with carcinoma of the lung.Dr. John Moses: I wonder if the cerebellar manifestations and even some of the endocrine abnormalities could have been due to the effect of a lung tumor alone, without metastases.Dr. Lerman: That's an interesting point. Tumors of any organ may produce a substance simulating overactivity of an endocrine gland, but never underactivity of that gland.Dr. Castleman: Dr. Federman, you had a chance to see this patient. Will you tell us about your experience with him?Dr. Daniel D. Federman: The case record is a model of pithiness and of necessity omits a great many fluctuations in the course, some of which were attributed to the therapy. We originally suspected that this man had primary myxedema, but the thyroid-stimulating-hormone test showed that it was a secondary phenomenon. The continuing downhill course despite adequate endocrine replacement made it unlikely that hypopituitarism was the cause of the seizures or the mental changes. We wondered whether overtreatment with thyroid should be incriminated, but that didn't seem to be the answer. When first seen the patient did not have diabetes insipidus, and its subsequent development reminded us that anatomical studies[3](#core-r003) have shown that more than 90 per cent of the secretory tissue must be destroyed before insufficiency of antidiuretic hormone can be demonstrated. The appearance of a new endocrine deficiency convinced us that there was a progressive disease, and thus we laboriously came around to the belief that there was tumor in the area of the hypophysis or hypothalamus. It is almost a general rule that the pituitary gland is the only endocrine gland in which tumor is a cause of hypofunction. Very rarely, metastatic replacement of the adrenal glands has been documented as the cause of adrenal insufficiency.Dr. James R. Carter, Jr.: The majority of the students agreed entirely with Dr. Lerman's diagnosis of primary carcinoma of the lung with metastases to the brain. There were 3 dissenters, 2 of whom thought that the patient had tuberculosis; the third was the discusser, Mr. Glass.Mr. Jonathan Glass: My diagnosis was sarcoidosis involving the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus, with secondary panhypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Richard B. Cohen: At autopsy we found about 1200 ml. of serous fluid in each pleural cavity. A particularly striking feature was the presence of dense adhesions in the region of the left upper lobe. In addition, nodular masses were seen in the mediastinum. As Dr. Lerman suggested, there were emboli scattered throughout both lungs, occluding the intermediate branches of the pulmonary artery, with multiple small infarctions. In the left upper lobe a 5-cm. area of necrosis was evident. Portions of that lesion were yellow and creamy in consistence, and it was mingled with what was clearly fibrous scar tissue. Microscopical study of this heterogeneous tissue disclosed a mucus-secreting adenocarcinoma, which in places was papillary in arrangement and in intimate relation with old scar tissue ([Fig. 4](#f004)). Therefore, this may be an example of a pulmonary tumor arising in a scar, particularly since such tumors are often of the adenocarcinoma type. The etiology of the original scar was not clear. No evidence of old granulomatous infection was found, and it is possible that the scar was the site of an old, healed, probably septic infarct. The mediastinal nodules were loaded with tumor, and the lymphatics throughout the lung contained tumor cells. Distant metastases had occurred. The adrenal glands were almost completely replaced by tumor, and it is easy to see how confusion might arise if one attempted to evaluate the pituitary function in this case by using the adrenal cortex as the target organ. The testes showed atrophy characteristic of postpubertal pituitary suppression. The thyroid gland was small, weighing 10 gm., but was without histologic abnormality. The pituitary gland was also the site of metastasis. However, the sella was not destroyed, and although the metastatic tumor did impinge upon the anterior pituitary tissue much of the parenchyma remained intact.The source of the pulmonary emboli was thromboses in the iliac veins. The patient had very slight cor pulmonale, which was not unexpected in view of the generalized lymphangitic spread of carcinoma. Dr. Price will present the pertinent neuropathological findings.Dr. Donald L. Price: We found more than 40 metastases randomly distributed in the cerebrum, thalamus, hypothalamus, optic chiasm, brain-stem and cerebellum ([Fig. 5](#f005)). Some of the lesions contained mutinous cores bordered by white, necrotic tumor. The largest metastasis was in the right temporal lobe, and there were smaller but critically situated implants in the brain-stem and cerebellum. Relevant to the endocrinologic problem was the discovery of a tumor deposit in the anterior hypothalamus, which had destroyed the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and was probably responsible for the diabetes insipidus that appeared late in the course. The seizures can be attributed to the multiple neoplastic foci in the gray matter. Some of those episodes were minor motor phenomena, whereas others were more suggestive of temporal-lobe origin. The cerebellar lesions were responsible for the nystagmus, ataxia and dysdiadochokinesia. The leftsided motor and sensory deficits were the result of tumor in the cerebrum and brain-stem. The obtundation, bilateral extensor plantar responses and other less specific neurologic signs were in all likelihood related to the multiplicity of the lesions. The improvement that was observed when the steroid dosage was increased may have been due to reduction of cerebral edema.Dr. Cohen: We were relieved when Dr. Price discovered the lesion involving the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, because the findings in the pituitary gland were insufficient to account for the endocrine deficiencies. We can now explain the pituitary failure on the basis of invasion of both the hypophysis and the hypothalamus by tumor. The manifestations of adrenal failure were certainly primary and can be ascribed to obliteration of the adrenal cortex by tumor.Dr. Federman: This is an extraordinary case. The findings provide a rationale for the confusing results of the endocrinologic tests, accounting for the lack of response of the adrenal glands to ACTH as well as for the pituitary failure. This combination may be unique.Dr. Irving P. Ackerman: Were you able to identify the pituitary stalk?Dr. Price: The pituitary stalk appeared normal but was not examined microscopically. When the sella was opened the pituitary gland was obviously abnormal.Dr. Joshua Hollander: When the patient was first seen the findings of nystagmus, ataxia and left hemiparesis suggested disease of the posterior fossa. A pneumoencephalographic study was contemplated to assess the hypothalamus and posterior fossa, but it seemed advisable to await improvement on replacement endocrine therapy. The initial lack of change in the neurologic status lent some false optimism. Subsequently, it became apparent that serious progressive intracranial disease was present.Dr. Cohen: I should add that a final lumbar puncture showed tumor cells on cytologic examination.Dr. Lerman: The patient had anesthesia in the distribution of the fifth nerve. Does the lesion in the medulla, which probably destroyed the fifth-nerve nucleus, explain that finding?Dr. Hollander: Quite well enough.\n",

      "question": "A 24-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of an abdominal mass.\nEleven years previously he was seen at another hospital because of dyspnea. Physical examination revealed right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and slight splenomegaly. An x-ray film of the chest showed a mediastinal mass. A biopsy of a supraclavicular lymph node disclosed Hodgkin's disease, nodularsclerosis type. A lymphangiographic study was negative. A laparotomy was not performed, and Stage 2A was assigned. Radiation treatment in a dose of 4000 rem was administered to the uppermantle area and to para-aortic lymph nodes; no chemotherapy was given.\nDuring the next five years he felt well. Six years before admission abdominal pain developed; a laparotomy revealed a large mass in the spleen and infiltration of peripancreatic and para-aortic lymph nodes. Microscopical examination of the excised spleen and retroperitoneal lymph nodes showed Hodgkin's disease, nodular-sclerosis type; biopsy specimens of the liver and bone marrow were normal. Twelve cycles of MOPP (nitrogen mustard, Oncovin [vincristine], prednisone, and procarbazine) were administered. Four years before entry examination showed complete regression of disease. Seventeen months before admission examination elsewhere was negative. X-ray films of the chest and abdomen were normal; dense calcifications were seen within left paratracheal and bilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes.\nTwo months before entry the patient observed a mass on the left side of the chest. A physician found a firm, nontender subcutaneous mass, 4 cm in diameter, between the sternum and the left nipple, partially fixed to an underlying rib. The liver was not felt; a vague abdominal fullness was palpated but could not be defined further. There was no lymphadenopathy. The hematocrit was 14.9 per cent; the white-cell count was 7200, with a normal differential count. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 17 mm per hour. The calcium was 9.8 mg (2.45 mmol per liter), and the phosphorus 4 mg per 100 ml (1.29 mmol per liter). The aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) was 29 U (0.23 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n), the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 231 U (3.85 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n), and the alkaline phosphatase 37 IU (0.62 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n) per liter. An x-ray film of the chest was unchanged; the lungs were clear. Films of the ribs and sternum disclosed no bony destruction. The mass was excised at another hospital; microscopical examination revealed a myxoma. A 67Ga scan (\nFig. 1\n) demonstrated large areas of increased uptake in the upper and lower portions of the abdomen. An intravenous pyelographic examination was negative and unchanged in comparison with a study performed four years earlier. The patient became anorectic and lost 3 kg in weight during the two months before entry. He occasionally felt feverish and sweaty at night and began to have abdominal and lumbar pain, with heartburn and a sensation of \"bloating.\"\nThe temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the pulse 100, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 130/90 mm Hg.\nOn examination he appeared ill. A right axillary lymph node, 2 cm in diameter, and shotty left axillary lymph nodes were found. The lungs were clear, and the heart normal. The abdomen was distended; a large, nontender mass in the right lower quadrant extended into the left lower quadrant. The liver was not felt. A firm mass, 5 cm in diameter, was palpated in the left inguinal region.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 43.3 per cent; the white-cell count was 14,500, with 59 per cent neutrophils, 12 per cent band forms, 16 per cent lymphocytes, 5 per cent monocytes, 3 per cent eosinophils, 2 per cent myelocytes, and 3 per cent metamyelocytes. The prothrombin time was 10.6 seconds, with a control of 11.8 seconds; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 75 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 16 mg per 100 ml (5.71 mmol per liter), the calcium 10.4 mg per 100 ml (2.59 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 5.3 mg per 100 ml (1.71 mmol per liter), and the uric acid 11.1 mg per 100 ml (0.66 mmol per liter); the protein was 6.9 g (the albumin 4.6 g and the globulin 2.3 g) per 100 ml. The SGOT was 59 U (0.48 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n), the LDH 1820 (30.34 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n), and the alkaline phosphatase 31 IU (0.52 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n) per liter. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. A serologic test for syphilis was negative. An x-ray film of the chest revealed a moderate right subpulmonic effusion; the lungs and mediastinum appeared normal; calcified lymph nodes were again noted. An ultrasound study of the abdomen and pelvis (\nFig. 2\n) demonstrated a large midline mass with a complex internal echo pattern, consistent with a homogeneous solid tumor that measured 12 by 8.5 by 8.5 cm; the presence of a moderate amount of gas precluded examination of the para-aortic lymph nodes. A\n99m\nTc sulfur colloid liverspleen scan confirmed that the spleen was absent; the liver appeared of normal size, with homogeneous activity.\nThe patient became progressively dyspneic, and the abdominal mass enlarged daily. He remained afebrile. On the fourth hospital day fluoroscopic examination of the chest showed a large, freely movable subpulmonic effusion on the right side; the left paravertebral stripe was displaced, with a multilobular impression consistent with para-aortic lymphadenopathy; the remainder of the lungs appeared clear; calcified paratracheal lymph nodes were again evident. A right-sided thoracentesis yielded 800 ml of yellow, cloudy fluid. An x-ray film of the chest obtained after the thoracentesis disclosed that most of the pleural fluid had been removed.\nA laparotomy was performed on the fourth hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Steven E. Come\\*: This 24-year-old man had received radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease. During a prolonged second remission of the disease a rapidly enlarging abdominal mass developed. The principal differential diagnosis of this mass involves two possibilities \u2014 a recurrence of Hodgkin's disease and a complication of the disease or its treatment. Less likely is a disorder unrelated to Hodgkin's disease or its treatment.May we review the radiologic studies at this time?Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: A film of the chest taken 11 years before the recent admission shows lobulated bilateral paratracheal lymph-node enlargement, without involvement of the hilar areas. This appearance is typical of mediastinal Hodgkin's disease. A film obtained 17 months before the admission under discussion demonstrates that the involvement of the paratracheal lymph nodes had regressed completely, having been replaced by dense calcification, a characteristic finding after successful radiation therapy of Hodgkin's disease.The urograms from the study two months before admission are normal. The gallium scan ([Fig. 1](#f001)) discloses a large, irregular area of increased activity projecting slightly to the left of the midline in the upper portion of the abdomen and a second, even denser discrete area of activity within the pelvis. A lateral view discloses that both collections were in the mid-plane or anterior plane of the abdomen. The pelvic process was also demonstrated at the time of admission on the ultrasonograms ([Fig. 2](#f002)), which show a sonolucent discrete, rounded mass just superior to the bladder, causing bulging of the anterior abdominal wall. Several echogenic areas are visible within the mass. I performed this scan and was able to palpate easily asupravesical mass. The transverse views show extension of the mass to both sides, with almost complete filling of the pelvis and lower portion of the abdomen. The more cephalad portion of the mass was obscured because of overlying bowel gas. A film of the chest taken on admission documents the presence of a fairly large right pleural effusion, most of which was subpulmonic.Dr. Come: I shall begin by considering the possibility that the abdominal mass was caused by recurrence of the Hodgkin's disease. A necessary first step in this assessment is to review the prior staging and treatment of this patient. The initial findings were typical for a 13-year-old patient with Hodgkin's disease.[1](#core-r001) At that age males predominate, and nodular sclerosis is the most comon histologic pattern. The involvement of the right supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph nodes reflected the predilection of nodular-sclerosis Hodgkin's disease for these sites. Because of the negative lymphangiographic study this patient was considered to have supradiaphragmatic Stage 2A disease. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that approximately two thirds of the patients with Hodgkin's disease in this age group have localized disease (i.e., Stage 1 or 2) rather than advanced disease at the time of the diagnosis. This patient's initial staging, however, was incomplete by today's standards since splenic involvement cannot be assessed reliably on clinical grounds.[2](#core-r002) Lymphangiographic examination does not usually permit visualization of lymph nodes above the renal pedicles. Furthermore, a false-negative rate of 8 per cent has been reported in lymphangiographic assessment of para-aortic and iliac lymph nodes. A recent review of laparotomy data from several institutions revealed that a third of the patients with clinical Stage 2 disease were advanced to pathological Stage 3 after abdominal exploration.[3](#core-r003) Thus, staging laparotomy is currently indicated to evaluate further clinically designated supradiaphragmatic Stage 2A disease. Information obtained by such a procedure, however, was not available to the physicians who initially cared for this patient. Assuming that the para-aortic radiation field included the spleen and its pedicle and extended to the pelvic brim, as is customary, I would not fault the initial management of this patient. In support of this position is a report from Stanford University of a series of patients who underwent comparable staging evaluation and similar initial treatment during the same period as that in this case. Despite the possibility of missing abdominal involvement when staging laparotomy is not performed, only 4 per cent of the patients treated with mantle and para-aortic radiation in that series had relapse of the disease in the abdomen.[4](#core-r004)Recurrent Hodgkin's disease of the nodularsclerosis type was documented in this patient five years after the completion of radiotherapy. Although 90 per cent of treatment failures occur during the first three years after therapy, a late relapse in the abdomen has been observed in patients with supradiaphragmatic Stage 1A and 2A disease.[4](#core-r004) Late relapse is also compatible with the frequently indolent course of nodular-sclerosis Hodgkin's disease. Relapse after initial treatment almost always eliminates the possibility of a subsequent prolonged disease-free survival or cure. However, the development of highly effective combination chemotherapy for advanced Hodgkin's disease has resulted in salvage of patients with recurrence after radiation therapy. As an initial treatment for Stages 3B and 4 disease, the MOPP chemotherapy regimen produces a complete remission rate of 80 per cent. Sixty-eight per cent of the patients in complete remission after treatment with MOPP chemotherapy at the National Cancer Institute have remained continuously free of relapse after more than 15 years of follow-up study.[5](#core-r005) When MOPP is given at the time of the first relapse after radiotherapy a complete response rate equivalent to that observed in previously untreated patients is achieved, but the data regarding the duration of remission are not as extensive as those for patients treated primarily with MOPP. Approximately 40 per cent of the patients treated for a second remission have a long-term disease-free survival and are potentially cured, but this figure is without respect to the site of the first relapse and the presence or absence of systemic symptoms at the time of relapse.After treatment of recurrent Hodgkin's disease with MOPP chemotherapy this patient apparently had a second complete remission. What were his prospects for cure? The relapse occurred in the spleen and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, with no evidence of marrow or liver involvement. MOPP treatment of relapses that involved only lymph nodes produced a 61 per cent subsequent three-year relapse-free survival in the patients studied at Stanford University.[6](#core-r006) Thus, the subgroup of patients with recurrent Hodgkin's disease confined to lymph nodes appears to have a more favorable prognosis than that for patients in general at the time of the first relapse. At the time of his relapse this man had no B symptoms such as fever or weight loss. According to the experience with MOPP as the primary form of treatment at the National Cancer Institute, most asymptomatic patients have complete remissions of long duration, with only 8 per cent having had a relapse to date.[5](#core-r005) This young man's chance of a continuous second remission, therefore, was better than the overall figure of 40 per cent. It must be pointed out, however, that patients with Hodgkin's disease of the nodular-sclerosis type have the highest rate of relapse after a MOPP-induced complete remission.[5](#core-r005)We are not told why this patient received 12 cycles of MOPP instead of the customary six. If the extended course was given because of residual disease after the initial six cycles that fact would augur poorly for him. However, the long interval between the completion of MOPP and the recent problem suggests an excellent response to chemotherapy, and I suspect that the motivation for the extra cycles was concern that this was a case of once relapsed rather than untreated disease.This patient, therefore, had a good chance of cure of the Hodgkin's disease despite an initial relapse, but he still may have had a second relapse. Do the clinical features described in the case record suggest recurrent Hodgkin's disease? Relapse from a MOPP-induced complete remission more than 42 months after the cessation of therapy is rare, but relapse or possibly reinduction of Hodgkin's disease has occurred as long as 90 months after therapy. In this case the mass that appeared five years after the completion of MOPP therapy could have been Hodgkin's disease. Furthermore, since recurrence after MOPP treatment is most common in areas of previous involvement, especially in lymph nodes, and contiguous sites, it might seem likely that the palpable abdominal mass was a manifestation of relapse in this patient. The uptake of gallium in the mass is compatible with Hodgkin's disease, particularly of the nodular-sclerosis type. However, there are a few details in the case record that make a diagnosis of recurrent Hodgkin's disease improbable. Although the gallium scan revealed a large positive area in the retroperitoneal region, the intravenous pyelographic study did not suggest retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Moreover, the abdominal ultrasound examination just before the second laparotomy disclosed a large midline mass apparently anterior to the retroperitoneum. This constellation of findings is unusual for abdominal Hodgkin's disease, which, except for hepatic and splenic involvement, is usually confined to the para-aortic and iliac lymph nodes. Furthermore, the daily enlargement of the abdominal mass indicates a rate of progression that is uncharacteristically rapid for Hodgkin's disease.During the past 15 years a great improvement in the treatment of advanced Hodgkin's disease, with successful salvage of some patients who have had a relapse after initial radiotherapy, has created a previously nonexistent population of intensively treated long-term survivors. Careful follow-up study of these patients is revealing information regarding the delayed consequences of treatment. One increasingly recognized association of intensive treatment of Hodgkin's disease is a high frequency of a second malignant tumor, the explanation of which is uncertain. Impaired cellular immunity is a feature of Hodgkin's disease itself. Extensive radiotherapy may result in a prolonged depletion of T lymphocytes, and chemotherapy is also known to be immunosuppressive. Thus, potential defects in immune surveillance mechanisms accompany both the disease and its treatment. Moreover, radiotherapy is known to have a carcinogenic effect. Alkylating agents and procarbazine have been shown to be carcinogenic in experimental studies in animals, and there is strong circumstantial evidence incriminating the former in the pathogenesis of the acute leukemias that follow the treatment of multiple myeloma and ovarian cancer.The relative contributions of the disease itself and its treatment to the development of a second malignant tumor cannot be established firmly without reference to an untreated population of patients with Hodgkin's disease for comparison. However, there have been some valuable empiric observations regarding the relation of Hodgkin's disease and its treatment to the development of a second malignant tumor. According to a study from the National Cancer Institute, the frequency of a second malignant tumor appears to be three or four times higher than expected when Hodgkin's disease is treated with either intensive radiotherapy or combination chemotherapy. If a patient receives both forms of therapy the frequency of a second tumor rises to over 20 times the expected frequency.[7](#core-r007) Furthermore, within this high-risk group the patients who, like the man under discussion, received initially only radiotherapy and were given chemotherapy at the time of relapse may have an even greater chance of having a second cancer.[8](#core-r008) The interval from the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease to the development of a second malignant tumor has varied but usually is less than five years. In most, but not all, cases the second tumor has been detected when the patient was in complete remission of the underlying Hodgkin's disease.[7\u201310](#core-r007) Several types of second malignant tumor have been described in patients with treated Hodgkin's disease, including squamouscell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of various sites as well as a variety of soft-tissue sarcomas.[7,9](#core-r007) The most commonly observed second cancer and the one that has been most convincingly related to intensive treatment of Hodgkin's disease is acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. A 4 per cent actuarial probability of the development of acute leukemia within seven years after the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease has been reported for patients who received combined modality treatment at Stanford University.[10](#core-r010) Having received this type of therapy, the patient under discussion was certainly at risk for the development of a second malignant tumor. Indeed, the myxoma of the left chest wall may have been related to the treatment, but the histologic findings were those of a benign tumor. Although treatment-induced malignant tumors may have a bizarre clinical behavior, a malignant soft-tissue tumor is characterized more by extensive local invasion than by intraabdominal metastases.What type of second cancer is compatible with the clinical features of this case? A recent report from Stanford University of six patients in whom a non-Hodgkin lymphoma developed during remission of Hodgkin's disease may have particular relevance.[11](#core-r011) All six patients had Hodgkin's disease of the nodularsclerosis type and received combined-modality treatment, with varying amounts of radiation and MOPP chemotherapy. Four of them, as in this case, were given MOPP for a recurrence after radiotherapy rather than as part of the initial therapeutic program. The median interval from the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease to the development of the non-Hodgkin lymphoma was 94 months, with a maximal interval of 124 months. The patient under discussion underwent the second laparotomy approximately 130 months after the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease. The abdominal mass in this case is consistent with the observation that in five of the six patients studied at Stanford University the non-Hodgkin lymphoma involved the gastrointestinal tract or another site in the abdomen. In contrast to Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin lymphomas frequently involve mesenteric and portal lymph nodes in addition to the para-aortic and iliac chains. Indeed, the diagnostic studies in this case suggest that the mass originated in or extensively involved the root of the mesentery. On pathological examination the six non-Hodgkin lymphomas studied at Stanford University were of the diffuse type with an unfavorable morphologic subtype. In four cases the disease was classified as diffuse undifferentiated lymphoma, and two patients were considered to have diffuse large-cell lymphoma, one subclassified as \"histiocytic,\" and the other as an immunoblastic sarcoma. Several characteristics of these aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas are compatible with the findings in this case. Avid uptake of gallium is frequent in diffuse histiocytic lymphomas, and rapid progression of the disease with an elevated uric acid level, as observed in this case, is characteristic of histiocytic and undifferentiated lymphomas. The LDH level, which was markedly elevated in this case, is often a useful index of activity of diffuse histiocytic lymphoma and undifferentiated lymphoma, particularly of the Burkitt type.In a 24-year-old man the presence of a rapidly growing abdominal mass that takes up gallium and is associated with an elevated LDH level should also suggest the possibility of a germ-cell tumor. To my knowledge, these tumors have not been described in association with Hodgkin's disease, but the therapeutic implications alone are a sufficient justification to consider the diagnosis in an appropriate setting. In the case under discussion, however, we have no information that specifically points to that type of tumor. The testes were apparently normal, although we cannot exclude the diagnosis on that basis since a testicular tumor may be small, and the disease may also originate within the retroperitoneum. There is no mention of an assay for the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin or for alpha-fetoprotein, both of which may be useful markers of testicular tumors.In conclusion, I believe that the diagnostic choice in this case is between recurrent Hodgkin's disease and a non-Hodgkin lymphoma, probably of the diffuse undifferentiated or large-cell histologic type, arising as a late complication of combined modality therapy for Hodgkin's disease. I cannot exclude the diagnosis of recurrent Hodgkin's disease in this patient, who had already experienced one relapse. However, I believe that the clinical course is more compatible with an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This diagnosis is supported by the projection made by the investigators at Stanford University of a 15.2 per cent actuarial risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma at 10 years in patients who have received combined modality treatment for Hodgkin's disease. I suspect that the second laparotomy confirmed the presence of such a non-Hodgkin lymphoma and revealed no evidence of Hodgkin's disease.Dr. James J. Galdabini: What did the medical students decide, Dr. Fang?Dr. Leslie Fang: They went through a similar analysis and believed that a second malignant tumor was the most likely explanation for the enlarging abdominal mass. They, too, came to the conclusion that it probably was a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. They could not exclude the possibility of recurrence of Hodgkin's disease but considered it less likely.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. John C. Long: Examination of the inital supraclavicular lymph-node specimen, obtained 11 years ago, revealed the characteristic features of Hodgkin's disease, nodular-sclerosis type. The node was replaced by irregular nodules composed of small lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and numerous Reed\u2013Sternberg cells and separated by dense collagenous bands. The staging procedure, done six years before the recent admission, revealed involvement of the spleen ([Fig. 3](#f003)) and retroperitoneal lymph nodes by Hodgkin's disease that was similar on microscopical examination to that observed in the original biopsy specimen five years earlier.The laparotomy, performed by Dr. Alfred M. Cohen, revealed approximately 500 ml of chylous ascitic fluid and a large mass arising in the vicinity of the ileum and cecum. The mass involved the appendix, displaced the ascending colon to the midline, and was contiguous to enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes that extended superiorly to the right hemidiaphragm. Microscopical examination of a biopsy specimen taken from the ileal mass revealed a diffuse infiltrate of closely packed, medium-sized lymphoid cells. Distributed among these cells were scattered pale histiocytes that imparted a \"starry-sky\" appearance ([Fig. 4](#f004)) and contained ingested cellular debris. Mitotic figures were numerous. The tumor-cell nuclei were uniform and of approximately the same size as those of the admixed phagocytic cells. The neoplastic cells had a narrow rim of vacuolated cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei, and multiple small nucleoli. A methyl green pyronine stain demonstrated intense cytoplasmic pyroninophilia of the tumor cells. A touch imprint disclosed prominent cytoplasmic clear vacuoles ([Fig. 5](#f005)) that were sudanophilic and therefore represented fat droplets. The tumor cells had uniform round nuclei with fine chromatin and multiple small pale nucleoli. The morphologic findings conformed to those of Burkitt's tumor as defined by the World Health Organization Report.[12](#core-r012) There was no evidence of residual Hodgkin's disease at the laparotomy.A cell suspension was prepared from the specimen, and lymphocyte surface-marker studies were done. Eighty per cent of the cells were found to contain surface immunoglobulin of the IgM heavy-chain class and kappa light-chain type, and approximately half the cells contained complement receptors and formed IgM EAC rosettes. The cells did not form spontaneous rosettes with sheep erythrocytes, and examination of the tumor was negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase by a fluorescent-antibody assay using rabbit antiserum against bovine TdT.[13](#core-r013)Examination of epon-embedded tissue sections, 1 \u03bcm in thickness, permitted a more precise evaluation of the tumor-cell nuclei, which appeared more pleomorphic than in the 4-\u03bcm thick, paraffin-embedded sections. Some of the nuclei were indented or defied, and the chromatin was coarse and irregularly distributed ([Fig. 6](#f006)). This degree of variation in the size and shape of the nuclei is not characteristic of Burkitt's lymphoma. Therefore, although the initial morphologic and immunologic surface-marker findings are consistent with that diagnosis,[14](#core-r014) the appearance of the nuclei, as revealed in the 1-\u03bcm sections, raises a question of its validity.Postoperatively, fever with pulmonary infiltrates, recurrent pleural effusions and ascites, and severe thrombocytopenia developed. The patient died 10 days after the operation. An autopsy was not performed, and no studies were done to find out whether the serum contained antibodies against Epstein\u2013Barr virus antigens.The clinical and pathological findings in this case are similar to those in the non-Hodgkin lymphomas that occurred in patients treated for Hodgkin's disease as described by Krikorian and his associates.[11](#core-r011) The abdomen or gastrointestinal tract was involved in five of the six patients reported from the Stanford Medical Center, and four of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas were of the undifferentiated type and resembled Burkitt's lymphoma. As in the case under discussion, the undifferentiated lymphomas in that series were less uniform on microscopical examination than in cases of typical Burkitt's lymphoma.Dr. Come: The tragedy in a case like this one is accentuated by the recognition that many patients of this type have probably been cured of Hodgkin's disease when the second malignant tumor occurs. However, that observation needs to be put into perspective. The gains in survival for patients with Hodgkin's disease achieved during the past 15 years far outweigh the complications that result from intensive treatment. Indeed, these complications are in a certain sense a reflection of the progress that has been made, since they could not have developed in patients who have died of Hodgkin's disease. The formulation of treatment programs that can simultaneously improve survival and be free of complications is the ongoing challenge. More than ever, we need to continue treating patients with Hodgkin's disease in the context of the carefully designed, meticulously executed clinical trial that has brought us so far in the management of this disease.\n",

      "question": "A 28-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of recurrent ventricular tachycardia.\nThere was a 12-year history of chronic active hepatitis with cirrhosis for which the patient took prednisone daily. Nine years before entry ulcerative colitis developed, with frequent exacerbations, especially during the spring. Four years later eosinophilia was detected; it ranged from 10 to 20 percent on differential counts and decreased during intervals when increased doses of prednisone were given. Anosmia and alopecia universalis developed, with apparent improvement when doses of prednisone were higher.\nFifty-eight months before entry third-degree atrioventricular block occurred, and a subcutaneous dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted. One year later the patient experienced the onset of asthma and allergic rhinitis, which improved with increases in the dose of prednisone. One year thereafter diarrhea recurred, and a test on a stool specimen showed Clostridium difficile toxin. Metronidazole was ineffective; vancomycin relieved the symptoms, but they recurred several times. In the same year warts developed in the perianal region and on the genitalia, hands, and feet; they were managed with locally administered liquid nitrogen. Intermittent fungal infections involved the toes. A year and a half before admission a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was made; a splenectomy was followed by remission; a liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis. A cardiac ultrasonographic examination was reported to be negative. Nine months before admission the patient was evaluated at another facility, where a tentative diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus was rejected. A diagnosis of a \u201csystemic autoimmune disease\u201d was made. Four months before entry another exacerbation of ulcerative colitis developed and was managed elsewhere. Radiographs of the chest were reported to be normal.\nSeven weeks before admission the patient experienced increasing dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness, without palpitations or chest pain, and found that he had gained approximately 3 kg in weight. Four weeks before entry a prolonged tachyarrhythmia occurred, with dyspnea. A wide-complex tachycardia was observed on an electrocardiographic monitor while the patient was being transported to a hospital; it resolved after the intravenous administration of lidocaine. An x-ray film of the chest showed cardiac enlargement. Another cardiac ultrasonographic examination revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10 to 15 percent. Electrophysiologic studies disclosed an inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, which was not suppressed by quinidine, mexiletine, or amiodarone and was terminated by overdrive pacing. Dobutamine and dopamine were given by vein, and hydralazine and furosemide were begun by mouth; prednisone was continued. A diagnosis of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy was made. Heart transplantation was considered but rejected, and the patient was transferred to this hospital.\nThe patient was a student. Twelve years before admission he had worked at bicycle repair and used a silicone lubricant frequently. At the time of admission, he had lost 6.8 kg in weight in recent weeks, with a decrease in food intake and the daily use of furosemide. His current medications included prednisone (25 mg daily), furosemide (40 mg daily), hydralazine (50 mg four times daily), cimetidine, potassium chloride, and magnesium chloride. There was no history of use of tobacco or alcohol, xerophthalmia, xerostomia, rash, photosensitivity, arthralgias, Raynaud's phenomenon, myopathy, sexually transmitted diseases, diabetes mellitus, valvular heart disease, thromboembolic disease, homosexual activity, or intravenous drug abuse or receipt of blood products, and no family history of coronary artery disease, sudden death, asthma, or autoimmune disease.\nThe temperature was 37.7 \u00b0C, the respirations were 18, and the blood pressure was 95/70 mm Hg; the heart rhythm was electronically paced at 85 beats per minute.\nOn physical examination the patient was completely hairless and appeared well. No lymphadenopathy or cutaneous abnormality was found except for perianal warts. The head and neck were normal; the jugular venous pressure was less than 5 cm. A subcutaneous pacemaker generator was present in the right pectoral region; the lungs were clear. A paced heart rhythm was regular; a sustained left ventricular impulse was palpated in the sixth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line, and a soft S3 sound was heard; no murmur was detected. The liver was not felt. The extremities and joints were normal, and the peripheral pulses were intact; there was onychomycosis of the toenails; no peripheral edema, cyanosis, or digital clubbing was found. The genitalia and rectum were normal; a stool specimen was negative for occult blood. Neurologic examination was negative.\nThe urine was normal. The hematologic and blood chemical values are presented in\nTable 1\nand\nTable 2\n. An electrocardiogram showed atrioventricular sequential pacing at a rate of 87 beats per minute. X-ray films of the chest (\nFigure 1\n) revealed an electronic pacemaker in the right anterior chest region, connected to electrodes that terminated in the area of the cardiac apex and right atrial appendage; the heart was slightly enlarged; the aorta, mediastinum, and pulmonary vasculature appeared normal, and the lungs were clear. Another cardiac ultrasonographic examination disclosed dilatation and diffuse hypokinesis of both ventricles; the left ventricular internal diameter was minimally increased, with an estimated ejection fraction of 36 percent; a pacemaker wire was present in the right heart chambers, and there was evidence of slight tricuspid regurgitation on Doppler echocardiography; the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 26 mm Hg; the pulmonic, mitral, and aortic valves appeared normal.\nSerum immunoelectrophoresis showed a normal IgG precipitin arc, with an increased concentration; the IgA and IgM precipitin arcs and concentrations were normal. The IgG was 1510 mg, the IgA 309 mg, and the IgM 281 mg per deciliter. A test for Bence Jones protein in a 50-fold concentrated specimen of urine was negative; small amounts of albumin and slightly larger amounts of alpha-1 globulin were present. The results of serologic testing are presented in\nTable 3\n.\nThe patient's usual medications were continued. The temperature ranged between 38.3 and 36.9 \u00b0C at all times, and the blood pressure was 90/60 to 95/70 mm Hg on most occasions. The patient remained comfortable at rest, with constant electronic pacing.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Ferdinand J. Venditti, Jr.[\\*](#FN1): May we review the x-ray film of the chest and the echocardiographic study?Dr. Stephen W. Miller: A film of the chest ([Figure 1](#f01)) obtained on the recent admission shows moderate cardiac enlargement and the permanent cardiac pacer, with its wires in the right atrium and right ventricle. The lungs are clear. There is no evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.Dr. Mary Etta King: The parasternal views from the echocardiographic study demonstrate left ventricular dilatation with normal wall thickness and no increased reflectivity of the ventricular myocardium. The left atrium is of normal size. There is slight thickening of the aortic-valve cusps but no stenosis. There is no pericardial effusion. The cross-sectional views of both ventricles show diffuse hypokinesis. The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 36 percent. There was no evidence of an intracardiac thrombus. The Doppler inflow pattern across the mitral and tricuspid valves was normal, with normal diastolic filling. There was no evidence of mitral regurgitation on color-flow Doppler study. There was a small jet of tricuspid insufficiency, with a peak velocity of 2 m per second, indicating a right ventricular pressure of 26 mm Hg.Dr. Venditti: In summary, this young man had a multisystem disorder. Cardiac manifestations developed over a five-year period and included complete heart block, congestive heart failure, and sustained ventricular tachycardia. I shall begin by reviewing the classification of cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. Disease in either category could have been responsible for this patient's illness.Cardiomyopathies have been divided into hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive types. The normal thickness of the ventricular walls in this case excludes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Restrictive cardiomyopathy is the least common of the three groups in the United States. Its hallmark is a \u201cstiff\u201d ventricle, with abnormal diastolic function and often with normal systolic function. Myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, or infiltration can be the underlying pathologic process. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may accompany amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, glycogen storage diseases, collagen-vascular diseases, eosinophilia, neoplastic disease, and fibroplastic disorders, among others. Since most of these disorders result in only a restrictive cardiomyopathy, I shall exclude them, although several of them deserve comment. Amyloidosis is characterized by an abnormal deposition of amyloid fibrils in almost any organ. Cardiac involvement can result in systolic dysfunction and congestive heart failure, restrictive cardiomyopathy, orthostatic hypotension, and arrhythmias[1](#core-r001). Up to 45 percent of the patients have atrioventricular block; complex ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death are also common[2](#core-r002). The diagnosis can be suspected clinically but is usually made by biopsy of the liver, kidney, rectum, gingiva, or bone marrow. I would have expected the diagnosis to have been made by liver biopsy in this case, if amyloidosis was present. Hemochromatosis is characterized by iron overload in many organs, causing dysfunction. Typically, the liver is the first organ affected, with hepatomegaly, frequently occurring without elevation of liver enzyme values. Alopecia, skin pigmentation, diabetes, arthropathy, testicular atrophy, gynecomastia, and palmar erythema are also seen. Cardiac involvement can result in dilated as well as restrictive myopathy, but conduction-system abnormalities and ventricular arrhythmias are uncommon[3](#core-r003). The diagnosis is important to make, since therapy can arrest or reverse cardiac dysfunction. Again, a liver biopsy would be diagnostic.Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common type and is characterized by increased ventricular size, reduced systolic function, and as in this case congestive heart failure. In most cases the cause is unknown. The syndrome may be the outcome of many toxic, metabolic, infectious, and inflammatory insults to the myocardium. The course of dilated cardiomyopathy is usually progressive, with worsening heart failure. The ventricles are generally uniformly involved, but segmental wall-motion abnormalities can be seen early in the course of the disease. As ventricular dilatation progresses, mitral and tricuspid valvular insufficiency can develop. The course can also be complicated by atrial tachyarrhythmias, conduction-system abnormalities, ventricular tachycardia, and fibrillation.In view of the acuteness of this patient's presentation, acute myocarditis is more likely. Its causes include infectious, inflammatory, and toxic agents. I shall exclude toxins because of the lack of a history of exposure to them. Viral myocarditis has to be considered. Symptomatic acute viral myocarditis can be characterized by chest pain, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, and even sudden death. The long-term outcome after an episode of myocarditis varies; frequently, there is no residual myocardial dysfunction. Some authors have speculated that idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is the result of a remote viral myocarditis that causes immunologic damage in the heart[4](#core-r004).The viruses that are most commonly implicated in acute myocarditis are the coxsackie group B viruses, or enteroviruses,[4](#core-r004) which often involve the heart, presumably because of an affinity of myocardial-membrane receptors for viral particles[5](#core-r005). The course is usually acute, and other symptoms precede the development of myocarditis, including myalgias, fever, nausea, vomiting, upper respiratory tract symptoms, arthralgias, and pleurodynia, none of which were present in this case. Hepatitis B virus has also been implicated as a cause of acute myocarditis. Lymphocytic infiltrates, petechiae, fatty infiltration, and edema can be seen on microscopical examination of the myocardium. The presentation is usually during the acute phase of viral hepatitis, with congestive heart failure and arrhythmias. The course is frequently fulminant and fatal[6](#core-r006). The results of viral serologic tests are not reported in this case.Nonviral infectious causes, such as bacteria, including mycobacteria, and rickettsia, are unlikely in this case in view of the absence of typical associated signs and symptoms. Cardiac involvement in Lyme disease, a spirochete infection transmitted by ticks, may take the form of complete atrioventricular block, myopericarditis, ventricular tachycardia, and left ventricular dysfunction[1,7](#core-r001). However, the absence of reported exposure, arthritis, and erythema chronicum migrans and the development of complete heart block during prednisone therapy make this diagnosis improbable. I do not believe that acute infectious myocarditis would explain all the findings in this case.The multisystem involvement in this patient suggests a systemic disease, with a chronic course punctuated by acute myocardial involvement. In a young patient with complete heart block and sustained ventricular tachycardia, sarcoidosis deserves consideration. It frequently affects the lungs, eyes, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, nervous system, kidneys, skin, and heart; involvement of the gut is very uncommon[8](#core-r008). The hallmark of sarcoidosis is a noncaseating granuloma, which can heal with fibrosis. Pulmonary involvement is characteristic, but isolated cardiac involvement has been reported[9](#core-r009). Sudden death, conduction-system disturbances, ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure, pericardial effusions, papillary-muscle dysfunction, and acute myocardial infarction have been reported in cardiac sarcoidosis[9,10](#core-r009). Granulomatous replacement of the myocardium can result in a restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy. Congestive heart failure can be the result of either acute or chronic myocardial involvement[9](#core-r009). Variable amounts of myocardium can be involved, and localized involvement of the conduction system can occur without extensive myocardial damage[11](#core-r011); conversely, massive cardiac involvement can be seen in the absence of manifest involvement of other organs[12](#core-r012). The base of the interventricular septum and the left ventricular free wall are frequently affected[12](#core-r012). Involvement of the septum explains the propensity for conduction-system disease, whereas involvement of the left ventricle, if extensive, can result in sustained ventricular tachycardia. In one report 48 percent of the patients had conduction-system disturbances, 32 percent had tachyarrhythmias, and 24 percent died suddenly[9](#core-r009). In another series 67 percent of the deaths were sudden, and in 17 percent of the patients sudden death was the initial manifestation of the disease[12](#core-r012). Ventricular free-wall involvement may progress to aneurysm formation, particularly during steroid treatment[9](#core-r009). Although steroid therapy is indicated in the presence of myocardial involvement, the cardiac disease may progress during treatment. Although some of the immunologic abnormalities seen in this case can occur in sarcoidosis,[13](#core-r013) eosinophilia of longstanding duration and asthma are uncommon. Also, the systems involved in this patient are not typically affected in sarcoidosis. Although sarcoidosis is a possibility, another syndrome better fits the clinical presentation in this case. I believe that the chronic eosinophilia was important in assessing the cause of this patient's disease.There are many causes of eosinophilia ([Table 4](#t04)). Bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and urticaria can be accompanied by moderate eosinophilia, but these disorders do not usually affect other organs and therefore do not explain the cardiac syndrome in this patient. Mycotic infections, such as bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis, and oromucocutaneous candidiasis, can be associated with eosinophilia[14](#core-r014). Although all three causative fungi can involve the heart, the usual presentation is during systemic mycotic infections in immunocompromised hosts and results principally from endocardial and pericardial involvement[1](#core-r001).Persistent severe eosinophilia of infectious cause usually occurs in tissue-invasive parasitic diseases, such as strongyloidiasis, trichinosis, schistosomiasis, filariasis, and toxocariasis[15](#core-r015). There is usually an associated elevated IgE level. Although the participation of eosinophils in the immune response remains enigmatic, they may have a role in the host response to these parasites[16](#core-r016). Eosinophil-derived proteins have toxic effects on helminths, although the clinical importance of this effect is unclear[17](#core-r017). Several of the helminths, such as Toxocara canis, rarely involve the heart primarily during the tissue-invasive phase of the infestation. The presentation is usually that of an acute myocarditis, with fever, dyspnea, and involvement of other organ systems, frequently resulting in death[18](#core-r018). The diagnosis should be suspected whenever there is evidence of exposure, which was lacking in this case. Other parasitic infestations, such as strongyloidiasis, would result in overwhelming infection in the setting of prednisone therapy. Therefore, I do not think that the eosinophilia and cardiac disease in this case were due to parasitic disease.Idiopathic or autoimmune chronic active hepatitis has been reported to be associated with eosinophilia[19](#core-r019). This syndrome typically affects boys and young men and is very responsive to steroid treatment. Other autoimmune diseases have been absent in most patients with this disorder. In the case under discussion the serologic type of the hepatitis is unknown, but in view of the lack of risk factors for viral hepatitis this patient probably had autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. Although antinuclear antibodies, antithyroid antibodies, thrombocytopenia, and ulcerative colitis can all be associated with chronic active hepatitis, primary cardiac disease is not part of the syndrome.Eosinophilia is infrequent in patients with collagen-vascular diseases, such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and polyarteritis nodosa. Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause pericarditis, noninfectious endocarditis, and mitral regurgitation[20](#core-r020). Rarely, myocarditis and myocardial infarction in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies have been reported[20](#core-r020). Although this patient had a positive test for antinuclear antibodies, the absence of other specific antibodies and of typical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus makes that diagnosis unlikely. Polyarteritis nodosa is a necrotizing vasculitis involving medium-sized and small arteries and adjacent veins. Because of the prominent renal involvement, the most common cardiac presentation is that of congestive heart failure and hypertension caused by renal failure. Myocardial infarction with subsequent ventricular dysfunction can also occur because of coronary artery vasculitis[21](#core-r021). A variant of polyarteritis nodosa is the Churg-Strauss syndrome, in which prominent eosinophilia and allergic disease antedate the vasculitic process. The heart is frequently involved in the vasculitic stage of this disease. I shall return to this entity later.If an exhaustive workup reveals no cause of eosinophilia and if signs and symptoms of organ-system dysfunction are present, the diagnosis of the idiopathic hypereosinophilia syndrome must be considered. The cause of organ-system dysfunction in this syndrome may be directly related to the abundant eosinophils. Eosinophil major basic protein and eosinophil cationic protein, both present in the granules of eosinophils, have been detected in high concentrations in patients with organ involvement, and their levels seem to correlate with the extent of the dysfunction[15](#core-r015). Eosinophil major basic protein has been demonstrated to cause cell damage in vitro in concentrations frequently present in patients with the hypereosinophilia syndrome[22](#core-r022). Also, there appears to be an association between cardiac disease and degranulated eosinophils in the periphery in that disorder, with more extensive involvement noted with higher concentrations of degranulated eosinophils[23](#core-r023).Virtually any organ system can be affected in the hypereosinophilia syndrome. Involvement of the neurologic, cutaneous, pulmonary, cardiac, and hepatic systems is common[15](#core-r015). Cardiac involvement is characterized by endomyocardial fibrosis, often referred to as Loffler's endocarditis. Hemodynamics are restricted by endomyocardial fibrosis[24](#core-r024). There may be valvular insufficiency because of the propensity for involvement of the support structures of the mitral and tricuspid valves[25](#core-r025). In addition, there is a characteristic obliteration of the apical segments of the right and left ventricles[26](#core-r026). These areas can be filled with clot, which can become organized, reducing the chamber size, and give rise to emboli[27](#core-r027). There is an initial acute myocarditis, which progresses with endocardial damage and thromboembolic events[15,28](#core-r015). The cellular infiltrate during the acute myocarditis is dominated by eosinophils[26](#core-r026); ultimately, endomyocardial fibrosis ensues[25\u201327,29](#core-r025). Conduction abnormalities might be expected in this syndrome because of the frequent inflammation and fibrosis of the subendocardium. Indeed, 18 of 64 patients in one report had conduction abnormalities[30](#core-r030). Ventricular tachyarrhythmias have also been reported, but sustained arrhythmias seem uncommon[31](#core-r031). Both types of arrhythmia occur in persons with far advanced disease[26](#core-r026). This case has many features consistent with the hypereosinophilia syndrome. The cardiac abnormalities could have been due to the acute necrotic phase of myocardial involvement. However, some aspects of the history, such as the asthma, would remain unexplained if we attribute this patient's presentation to the hypereosinophilia syndrome.The Churg-Strauss syndrome, or allergic granulomatosis and angiitis, best explains this patient's constellation of findings. This syndrome may be very similar to the hypereosinophilia syndrome clinically but is characterized, in addition, by asthma or allergic rhinitis and evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis involving at least two organ systems[32](#core-r032). Asthma is seldom a component of the hypereosinophilia syndrome, and there is no associated vasculitis[33](#core-r033). The Churg-Strauss syndrome is characterized typically by three phases -- asthma or atopic disease, peripheral eosinophilia, and ultimately vasculitis. The heart, lungs, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and nervous system are frequently involved. Peripheral eosinophilia is the hallmark of the disease, but because of the wide and rapid fluctuations of the eosinophil count it can be missed[14](#core-r014). In addition, steroids are potent suppressors of eosinophilia, and if they are administered for other reasons, as in this case, eosinophilia may be less prominent.In the series reviewed[31\u201339](#core-r031) almost all patients with the Churg-Strauss syndrome had a history of asthma, which is unusual in other vasculitic syndromes, such as polyarteritis nodosa and Wegener's granulomatosis[34](#core-r034). Asthma typically antedates eosinophilia by three years and vasculitis by five years[35](#core-r035). There is frequently a dissociation between asthma and the onset of vasculitis, with bronchospastic symptoms abating during the period of acute vasculitis[32](#core-r032). The characteristic pathological findings in this disease are tissue infiltration by eosinophils, extravascular granulomas, and necrotizing vasculitis involving small arteries and venules[40](#core-r040). Eosinophilic infiltrates are seen, particularly early in the development of the lesions. Interstitial eosinophilic infiltrates and scattered fibrosis can be seen in the myocardium in addition to granulomas and vasculitis.Pulmonary involvement results in infiltrates, which have been reported in 72 percent of the cases of the Churg-Strauss syndrome[32](#core-r032). These infiltrates may be symmetric, involving the periphery and axillary zones, or they may radiate from the hilus, like the infiltrates of pulmonary edema[36](#core-r036). Upper respiratory tract disease is typified by allergic rhinitis, which commonly occurs early in the disease. Eosinophilic infiltrates can involve any part of the gut. With mucosal involvement of the large bowel, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bleeding can occur. Up to 33 percent of the patients have diarrhea, and 18 percent have gastrointestinal bleeding during their clinical course[32](#core-r032). Colitis closely resembling ulcerative colitis can occur, with a relapsing and remitting course[35](#core-r035). This type of presentation results in the inclusion of eosinophilic colitis in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. Although gastrointestinal and pulmonary involvement can occur during the prodrome, skin, nervous-system, renal, and cardiac involvement is usually limited to the vasculitic phase. Malaise, fatigue, and lassitude often herald the onset of this phase. Cutaneous involvement is seen in 70 percent of the patients during the vasculitic phase[32](#core-r032). The manifestations include a macular or papular erythematous rash, urticaria, subcutaneous nodules, or purpura, which can be palpable. Purpura is by far the most common skin manifestation, occurring in almost half the patients. Biopsy of the subcutaneous nodules frequently reveals granulomas. The nervous system is involved in up to 75 percent of the cases of the Churg-Strauss syndrome[32](#core-r032). Mononeuritis multiplex is the most common lesion, but diffuse, symmetric peripheral neuropathy is also seen. Central nervous system involvement usually occurs late in the course of fulminant disease. Renal involvement is limited, with only occasional examples of severe disease, in contrast to polyarteritis nodosa, in which most of the patients have clinically important renal involvement[21](#core-r021).Cardiac manifestations of the Churg-Strauss syndrome are the most serious, since half the mortality due to this disease is directly related to cardiac involvement[37](#core-r037). At autopsy granulomas are commonly found in the heart,[40](#core-r040) most prominently in the epicardium but also diffusely in the myocardium, which may be extensively replaced by granulomas and fibrosis. Acute myocarditis, constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and complete heart block have all been reported as consequences of cardiac involvement[30,32,33,35,38\u201341](#core-r030). The obliterative and restrictive endomyocardial involvement that typifies hypereosinophilic endomyocarditis is seen rarely in this syndrome[33](#core-r033).Patients with this syndrome are usually treated with corticosteroids or cytotoxic agents[37,42](#core-r037). Although involvement of the heart as well as other organs has progressed despite therapy,[35,38](#core-r035) substantial improvement in myocardial function has been achieved with aggressive early treatment[43,44](#core-r043). Acute congestive heart failure can develop as doses of steroids are tapered, with reactivation of vasculitis, but responds to an increase in the dose, with resolution of the symptoms.Therefore, I believe that this patient had the Churg-Strauss syndrome, with cutaneous, colonic, and cardiac involvement. The findings of eosinophilia and asthma support this interpretation. The purpura noted at the time that \u201cidiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura\u201d was diagnosed may have been due to skin involvement, and the accompanying thrombocytopenia may have been related to hypersplenism caused by cirrhosis. The recent exacerbation of ulcerative colitis may have been the result of colonic involvement. Early granulomatous involvement of the conduction system probably caused complete heart block. Recurrent involvement probably resulted in more extensive cardiac disease, with acute myocarditis. This situation was presumably complicated by systolic dysfunction and ventricular tachycardia. I believe that the procedure performed was a right ventricular biopsy at the time of cardiac catheterization, which could have demonstrated granulomas, eosinophilic infiltrates, necrotizing vasculitis, or fibrosis or a combination of these findings.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Brooks, you took care of this patient. Will you tell us your impressions?Dr. D. Ross Brooks: We thought that the patient had nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, possibly related to active myocarditis, with resultant congestive heart failure and recurrent ventricular tachycardia.Dr. Scully: Dr. Merkel, will you comment on your impressions?Dr. Peter A. Merkel: Some of the many abnormalities of his immune function are consistent with lupus. Immune thrombocytopenia is frequent and may precede the diagnosis by years. Myocarditis is seen in approximately 10 percent of patients with the disease, with the prevalence higher in autopsy series[45](#core-r045). Complete heart block occurs in infants who acquire maternal antibodies to Ro antigen, but in adults with systemic lupus erythematosus complete heart block is a manifestation of underlying myocardial disease. However, lupus-related myocarditis is usually seen in the presence of other obvious manifestations of the disease. The most interesting aspect with regard to the possibility of systemic lupus erythematosus is the high titer of antinuclear antibodies. Over 90 percent of patients with idiopathic systemic lupus erythematosus have a positive test for antinuclear antibodies, but the finding is not specific[46](#core-r046). Antinuclear antibodies are seen in patients with many other diseases thought to have an autoimmune basis as well as in some healthy persons. A high titer of antinuclear antibodies, as seen in this patient, increases the likelihood of a true positive test. To define better the antigen or antigens resulting in the presence of antinuclear antibodies in this case, testing for extractable nuclear antigens was done. No antibodies to Ro (SSA), La (SSB), Smith (Sm), or ribonuclear protein (RNP) antigens or to double-stranded DNA were found in this patient's serum. The presence of antibodies to Sm antigens or to double-stranded DNA would have been highly suggestive of a diagnosis of lupus in this patient[46,47](#core-r046). Therefore, although the patient had some features of systemic lupus erythematosus, it would not explain all his gastrointestinal, infectious, dermatologic, and hematologic manifestations.Could this patient's positive test for antinuclear antibodies have resulted from his hydralazine use? Hydralazine is well known to cause tests for antinuclear antibodies to be positive. It is important to differentiate drug-induced seroconversion to positivity for antinuclear antibodies from drug-induced lupus in which the patient has clinical findings of systemic lupus erythematosus. Histone antibodies develop in over 90 percent of patients with hydralazine-induced autoimmunity[47](#core-r047). A test of this patient's serum for the presence of histone antibodies was negative, but the result was not available until after his discharge. Although the absence of histone antibodies does not exclude hydralazine as a cause of the positive test for antinuclear antibodies, it makes it considerably less likely. Furthermore, it is usually months between the start of hydralazine and the development of antinuclear antibodies rather than several weeks, as in this case. If the test for antinuclear antibodies in this patient had been positive because of hydralazine, the titer would have fallen and the test would eventually have become negative after discontinuation of the drug. Therefore, it seems possible that the patient had a yet undefined idiopathic autoimmune disease, but the positive test for antinuclear antibodies does not define his illness more precisely.Finally, the possibility that this patient was extensively exposed to silicone about the time that his clinical problems began raises the controversial issue of silicone-induced autoimmune disease. This is an area of intense current investigation in view of the multiple reports of the development of clinical features of autoimmune disease in patients with silicone-based breast implants[48](#core-r048).\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. John T. Fallon: The diagnostic procedure was an endomyocardial biopsy. Microscopical examination revealed no amyloid or iron deposition, no eosinophils, and no granulomas or vasculitis. Thus, there was no evidence of sarcoidosis or the Churg-Strauss syndrome. There were, however, three fragments that were obtained at the time of the cardiac biopsy. Examination of one of the fragments showed relatively intact myocardium and focal areas of inflammation characterized by an interstitial mononuclear-cell infiltration, with loss of myocardial cells ([Figure 2](#f02)), consistent with active lymphocytic myocarditis. Immunoperoxidase staining for UCHL-1 revealed that large numbers of the mononuclear cells were T lymphocytes.Dr. Brooks: Because of his drug-refractory ventricular arrhythmias the patient received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator system while he was in this hospital. In view of the finding of lymphocytic myocarditis, he received a course of prednisone and azathioprine. I have seen him regularly over the last five months. For the first four months he had no cardiac symptoms. Approximately three weeks ago weakness and ascites developed, and he was admitted to another hospital, where he was found to have acute renal-vein and portal-vein thrombosis and a myopathy due to the steroids. He has become dialysis-dependent and is doing poorly. A repeated echocardiographic examination showed very poor left ventricular function.Dr. Scully: Dr. Venditti, do you have a final comment?Dr. Venditti: I approached this case with the law of parsimony in mind. In my attempt to make a unifying diagnosis I considered the constellation of clinical findings most consistent with the Churg-Strauss syndrome, although the pathological findings do not support that diagnosis. Acute lymphocytic myocarditis is seen in many autoimmune disorders, but the accompanying clinical findings in this case are not consistent with the known entities. Therefore, I agree with Dr. Merkel that this patient probably had an as yet undefined autoimmune disorder.\n\nAddendum\n--------\n\nDr. Fallon: The patient died six months after the endomyocardial biopsy was performed. An autopsy was performed elsewhere. The heart weighed 480 g, and all four chambers were dilated. The valves were normal. The ventricular myocardium appeared flabby and yellow-brown throughout. Microscopical examination of the left ventricular myocardium revealed circumferential, subendocardial fibrosis and an ongoing diffuse lymphocytic myocarditis ([Figure 3](#f03)). There was no infiltrate of eosinophils, although the pathological findings were similar to those seen in endomyocardial fibrosis secondary to Loffler's myocarditis,[49](#core-r049) suggesting a possible link to the history of eosinophilia.\n",

      "question": "A 15-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of virilization.\nThe patient was black, a native of Jamaica, and a recent immigrant to this country. Her menarche occurred at the age of 11 years, with regular menses every 30 days, accompanied by abdominal cramps and breast tenderness. During the two years before admission the menses became irregular, and they ceased 18 months before admission, with only infrequent spotting thereafter. A physician noticed that her voice was deep; the clitoris was enlarged, and watery secretion could be expressed from one breast. Four months before entry acne of the face and chest began to appear.\nTwo months before admission she was first seen at this hospital. The blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg. Examination revealed no cutaneous striae or facial rounding. A female escutcheon was present, with scanty abdominal hair, no facial or breast hair, and no frontal balding; mild acne was observed. Pigmentation was considerably increased over the neck and axillas, with velvety hypertrophy of skin in these areas. The visual fields were normal, and the thyroid gland was not enlarged. The lungs were clear, and the heart was normal. The breasts appeared normal except that scanty clear fluid was expressed bilaterally. The abdomen was normal. Pelvic examination revealed that the clitoris was enlarged and measured 4 by 1.5 cm. The vagina was erythematous and contained a thick discharge; the cervix appeared normal. The uterus was of normal size and anteverted; the ovaries were not felt, and no masses were found. The extremities were normal, and neurologic examination was negative.\nThe urea nitrogen was 11 mg per 100 ml (3.9 mmol per liter), the glucose 98 mg per 100 ml (5.4 mmol per liter), the thyroxine 7.1 \u03bcg 100 ml (91 nmol per liter), and the total triiodothyronine 135 ng per 100 ml (2.08 nmol per liter). The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 1.2 \u03bcU per milliliter, and the tri-iodothyronine resin uptake was 27 per cent. The prolactin was 1.4 ng, the luteinizing hormone (LH) 13.3 mIU, and the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 13.8 mIU per milliliter; the androstenedione was 505 ng, the testosterone 105 ng, and the unbound testosterone 2.17 ng per 100 ml. In a 24-hour specimen of urine the 17-ketosteroids were 14 mg (49 \u03bcmol per liter), the 17-hydroxycorticosteroids 9.3 mg (26 \u03bcmol per liter), and the creatinine 1452 mg (12.84 mmol \u00b7 kg\n-1\n). X-ray films of the skull showed that the sella turcica was of normal size and had a smooth margin, without calcification. An ultrasound examination revealed that the uterus was of normal size and echo texture; the ovaries appeared normal; the right kidney and suprarenal area appeared normal; the left suprarenal area was inadequately demonstrated. Cytologicexamination of material in the vagina was negative for tumor cells.\nAt a return visit 2 1/2 weeks later the bilirubin was 0.3 mg per 100 ml (5 \u03bcmol per liter), and the protein 8.1 g (the albumin 4.4 g, and the globulin 3.7 g) per 100 ml. The sodium was 141 mmol, the potassium 3.9 mmol, the chloride 102 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 25 mmol per liter. The LH was 17 mIU, and the FSH 16.2 mIU per milliliter. The testosterone was 194 ng, the unbound testosterone 3.24 ng, and the androstenedione 474 ng per 100 ml. The prolactin was 2.2 ng per milliliter. The fasting cortisol was 2.2 \u03bcg per milliliter at 8 a.m. after the administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone at midnight. At a later visit the fasting glucose was 85 mg per 100 ml (4.7 mmol per liter), and the simultaneous insulin was 60 \u03bcU per milliliter. During the month before entry the patient had continued enlargement of the clitoris, progressive deepening of her voice, and hyperpigmentation of the knuckles. She was admitted to the hospital.\nThere was a history of meningitis at the age of two weeks, with complete recovery. She had experienced rare bifrontal headaches, which increased in frequency in recent years, with occasional scintillations but no definite scotomas, and had gained an unknown amount of weight during the 18 months before entry. There was no history of constipation, syncope, frank galactorrhea, muscle cramps, or mental changes, and she took no medication.\nPhysical examination revealed no important change.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 43 per cent, and the white-cell count 8100. The urea nitrogen was 8 mg per 100 ml (3 mmol per liter), and the glucose 85 mg per 100 ml (4.7 mmol per liter). An x-ray film of the chest was normal. During an oral glucose tolerance test the fasting glucose was 81 mg per 100 ml (4.5 mmol per liter); at 30 minutes it was 140 mg per 100 ml (7.8 mmol per liter), at one hour 105 mg per 100 ml (5.83 mmol per liter), at two hours 101 mg per 100 ml (5.61 mmol per liter), and at three hours 93 mg per 100 ml (5.6 mmol per liter). The corresponding insulin levels were 20 \u03bcU, 15 \u03bcU, 205 \u03bcU, 198 \u03bcU, and 88\n\u03bcU\nper milliliter. After the administration of dexamethasone, 1 mg by mouth at 11 p.m., the fasting cortisol was 0.6 \u03bcg per 100 ml (0.02 \u03bcmol per liter). Fifteen minutes after the injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (Cortrosyn), 0.5 U by vein, the cortisol was 23 \u03bcg per 100 ml (0.63 \u03bcmol per liter), at 30 minutes 31 \u03bcg per 100 ml (0.86 \u03bcmol per liter), at 60 minutes 29 \u03bcg per 100 ml (0.80 \u03bcmol per liter), and at 120 minutes 18 \u03bcg per 100 ml (0.50 \u03bcmol per liter). A luteinizing-hormone\u2013releasing-hormone (LH\u2013RH) test was performed (\nTable 1\n).\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Jeffrey S. Flier\\*: This 15-year-old girl presented with a clinical history that had three main features. There were signs, symptoms, and physical evidence of hyperandrogenism, which was increasingly severe over a year and a half and culminated in frank virilization. Secondly, she had hyperpigmentation and thickening of the skin, presumably acanthosis nigricans, of uncertain duration. In addition, there was clinically inapparent but biochemically demonstrable resistance to endogenous insulin, which was indicated by normal glucose tolerance at the expense of increased levels of immunoreactive insulin. In my discussion I shall first address the differential diagnosis of the hyperandrogenism and shall then discuss our current understanding of the link between it and the two other key features of this case, acanthosis nigricans and tissue resistance to insulin.May we review the radiologic studies at this point?Dr. Joseph F. Simeone: Posteroanterior and lateral films of the chest are normal. On a lateral view of the skull there is no evidence of enlargement or of calcification of the sella turcica. The ultrasound study demonstrates a uterus of normal size, configuration, and echogenicity for a 15-year-old girl. The ovaries are also of normal size and texture, with no evidence of abnormal masses within the pelvis.Dr. Flier: The clinical manifestations of an androgen excess in women are a common reason for endocrinologic consultation. The clinical and biochemical findings in these women have a wide range of severity.The mildest manifestations, which include hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularities such as oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, and infertility, are the most prevalent. More serious manifestations include deepening of the voice, muscular development, temporal balding, atrophy of the breasts, and clitoral enlargement. In general, the severity of the clinical findings correlates well with the rate of production of testosterone and the level of free testosterone. The disorder in this patient was relatively severe, with clear-cut virilization in the form of deepening of the voice and clitoromegaly in association with high levels of both the total and the more biologically relevant free testosterone. Despite this virilization, hirsutism was not described. Its absence was presumably a result of relative resistance to dihydrotestosterone at the level of the hair follicles, perhaps on a familial basis.Increased androgen production has two possible anatomical sources \u2014 the adrenal glands and the ovaries. My goal is to determine the source in this patient and in the process to distinguish between the relatively rare androgen-secreting tumors and the much more prevalent androgenic disorders that are non-neoplastic.I shall begin with the possibility of an adrenal origin of this patient's disorder. In a normal woman approximately 25 per cent of testosterone is secreted directly by the ovaries, 25 per cent is secreted by the adrenal glands, and about 50 per cent is synthesized in peripheral tissues, such as fat, liver, skin, and neural tissue, from testosterone's major steroid precursors. These are androstenedione, which is secreted by both the ovaries and the adrenal glands, and dihydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), which is derived almost exclusively from the adrenal glands. Thus, the adrenal glands normally secrete both testosterone and its precursors. Abnormal adrenal glands may produce testosterone or its precursor steroids in a variety of diseases.I shall consider first the possibility of Cushing's syndrome. Patients with that disorder often have evidence of androgen excess, generally in the form of mild hirsutism. Occasionally, the clinical course of a patient with Cushing's syndrome is dominated by hyperandrogenic features, particularly in cases of adrenocortical carcinoma. In any woman with a high androgen level the possibility of concomitant hypercortisolism should be considered. If it is present the proper treatment is that used for Cushing's syndrome, dependent, of course, on its cause, regardless of the severity of the accompanying androgen excess. This patient had no clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, such as hypertension or truncal obesity, and, more importantly, the diagnosis was ruled out by the normal suppression of the morning plasma cortisol level after the administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone at midnight.Virilizing adrenal tumors that do not overproduce cortisol must also be considered. They typically secrete large amounts of the biologically inactive testosterone precursors, androstenedione and DHEA-S, a small proportion of which are then converted in peripheral tissues to the potent androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. As a result, patients with these tumors excrete large amounts of 17-ketosteroids in the urine. The fact that the level of urinary 17-ketosteroids was only minimally elevated in this patient weighs against the diagnosis of an adrenal tumor. However, an exception to the rule that virilizing adrenal tumors are always associated with high levels of urinary 17-ketosteroids exists in an unusual form of testosterone-secreting adrenal adenoma.[1](#core-r001) This type of tumor, which can be small, has two properties that are unusual in view of its origin in the adrenal gland. The first is that it responds to the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin with increased production of testosterone, as would be expected with an ovarian source. Secondly, exogenous estrogen can reduce the production of testosterone by this type of tumor, presumably by inhibiting release of endogenous LH. This unexpected behavior demonstrates one of the pitfalls of attempting to determine the anatomical source of androgen overproduction by indirect means such as hormonal stimulation and suppression studies. Although rare, a testosterone-secreting adrenal adenoma has not been ruled out by the endocrine studies reported in this case record.Non-neoplastic adrenal disorders may also produce hyperandrogenism with its clinically evident onset in adult female patients. The term \"congenital adrenal hyperplasia\" refers to a group of disorders in which a defect exists in the pathways for cortisol biosynthesis, leading to compensatory hypersecretion of ACTH. This in turn leads to adrenal hyperplasia and overproduction of the steroid molecules that are synthesized before the enzymatic block, some of which are precursors of testosterone. Virilization of female neonates or children may occur with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the most common variety, or, much less commonly, with 11-hydroxylase or 3-beta-ol-dehydrogenase deficiency. The concept that adult-onset hyperandrogenism may also be due to an acquired or mild form of adrenal-enzyme defect has been proposed for many years and has recently received increased attention. It is now clear that attenuated forms of inherited 21-hydroxylase[2,3](#core-r002) and 3-beta-ol-dehydrogenase[4](#core-r004) deficiency may present with the onset of mild to moderate hyperandrogenism in adolescence or adulthood. Unlike typical 21-hydroxylase deficiency, in which the 17-ketosteroid level is clearly elevated, patients with attenuated 21-hydroxylase deficiency characteristically have moderately increased levels of testosterone in association with only minimally increased or high-normal levels of 17-ketosteroids. In this respect, the adrenal enzyme defect mimics that of polycystic ovarian disease. Attempts to distinguish this disorder from polycystic ovarian disease are confused further by the fact that in these patients typical polycystic ovarian disease may be mimicked by the presence of an increased ratio of LH to FSH. Therefore, a definitive diagnosis of these mild adrenal-enzyme defects appears to require measurement of specific steroid preCursors. With 21-hydroxylase deficiency the plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone level is elevated, especially in response to the administration of ACTH, and an isolated elevation of DHEA-sulfate is seen with 3-beta-ol-dehydrogenase deficiency.[4](#core-r004) Because the levels of these specific steroids were not assessed in this case these disorders cannot be excluded on the basis of the available data. Establishing the diagnosis of these adrenal-enzyme disorders is important because physiologic cortisol replacement reverses the hyperandrogenism by decreasing the excessive production of ACTH and the consequent stimulation of adrenal androgens.Non-neoplastic disorders of the ovary are much more common causes of hyperandrogenism than virilizing ovarian tumors. A concerted attempt must be made to rule out a tumor, however, particularly in cases in which hyperandrogenism is severe or occurs at a rapid pace.Various ovarian tumors are capable of overproducing androgens. They include arrhenoblastomas as well as hilus-cell tumors, lipid-cell tumors, thecomas, and luteomas. Although there is much variation in the clinical manifestations, androgen-secreting ovarian tumors are generally known for the severity of the virilization that they produce as well as for biochemical evidence of marked overproduction of testosterone. The arrhenoblastoma is the most common androgen-producing tumor of the ovary, and the clinical picture in this case is consistent with that diagnosis. The peak age at onset of this tumor is between 20 and 40 years, but it has been reported in a patient as young as two years of age.[5](#core-r005) It is often small and can be missed on pelvic examination or ultrasound study. Like hilus-cell and lipid-cell tumors it typically secretes testosterone as the predominant androgen and may result in severe virilization despite normal or only minimally increased levels of urinary 17-ketosteroids. The explanation for this fact lies in the observation that the administration of 2.5 mg of testosterone to a normal woman will cause virilization but will elevate urinary 17-ketosteroids by only 1 mg per day. A testosterone level in excess of 300 ng per 100 ml should raise a strong suspicion of an ovarian tumor. Although the highest testosterone level recorded in this patient was 194 ng per 100 ml, an ovarian tumor remains an important consideration because of the rapid pace with which the virilization developed. Selective venous catheterization studies may be used to localize a tumor when it is suspected, but the interpretation of the results may be ambiguous. Laparoscopic visualization of the ovary may disclose the presence of a tumor, but if that examination is negative it may not exclude the possibility of a small tumor buried within the substance of the ovary. Proceeding directly to laparotomy is a reasonable approach in cases, such as this one, in which a tumor is suspected but impossible to exclude by other means.The most common disorder causing hyperandrogenism in women is the Stein\u2013Leventhal syndrome, or polycystic ovarian disease. The typical clinical pattern in this syndrome is that of a post-menarcheal onset of oligoamenorrhea, hirsutism, and infertility. Frank virilization is uncommon. Obesity, although often present, is not a feature in a substantial minority of the patients. The two major biochemical abnormalities in this syndrome are excessive production of androgens and disordered gonadotropin secretion, manifested by high levels of LH with increased frequency and amplitude of LH pulses and low levels of FSH. Although androgen production is always increased in patients with polycystic ovarian disease, the plasma testosterone level is typically high-normal or only slightly elevated. This finding is a consequence of reduced levels of sex-hormone-binding globulin, which is suppressed by androgens as well as by obesity. For this reason the free testosterone level more accurately reflects the rate of testosterone production. Several lines of evidence suggest that the gonadotropin abnormality may be a consequence of the androgen excess. First of all, similar gonadotropin dynamics may be seen with androgen excess due to adrenal-enzyme deficiencies, as previously discussed.[4](#core-r004) Secondly, reversal of androgen excess has restored gonadotropin dynamics to normal in some patients. Whether excessive androgens exert their effect directly or via conversion to estrogens in the pituitary gland is not yet known. In the case under discussion the LH and FSH responded briskly to LH-RH. This finding is consistent with the diagnosis of polycystic ovarian disease and is evidence of the primed state of the pituitary gonadotropins in this disorder.[6](#core-r006) The major factors weighing against this diagnosis, however, are the unusually high levels of plasma testosterone and the presence of overt virilization.The high levels of plasma testosterone are characteristic of ovarian hyperthecosis, a non-neoplastic condition closely related to polycystic ovarian disease. This lesion is characterized by the presence of clusters of luteinized cells scattered in a hyperplastic ovarian stroma.[7](#core-r007) This syndrome may overlap both clinically and biochemically with polycystic ovarian disease, but in cases of full-blown disease frank virilization, obesity, hypertension, and glucose intolerance are found. Familial examples have been reported.[8](#core-r008) Virilization may develop abruptly, even in postmenopausal women, thus suggesting the presence of a virilizing neoplasm.[9](#core-r009) Oophorectomy is often required to control the virilization.What are the implications of the acanthosis nigricans in this patient? This cutaneous disorder is characterized by symmetric, hyperpigmented, verrucous, hyperkeratotic thickening of the skin. It most often affects the nape of the neck, axillas, and groins and if severe may involve mucous membranes or the entire cutaneous surface. The lesion is well known for its association with visceral malignant tumors, particularly those of the stomach, and it may develop before or after the tumor has become evident clinically.[10](#core-r010) A tumor-derived humoral factor that may be responsible for this association has not been identified. Acanthosis is also known to occur with a variety of metabolic endocrine disorders, including obesity, and diseases of the thyroid, pituitary, and adrenal glands.[10](#core-r010) Most relevant in regard to this case is the emerging association of acanthosis nigricans with a group of uncommon disorders that are characterized by extreme target-cell resistance to the action of insulin. These include leprechaunism, lipoatrophic diabetes, Allstrom's syndrome, the pineal-hyperplasia syndrome, and the Type A and B syndromes of insulin resistance.[11](#core-r011)The Type B syndrome of insulin resistance with acanthosis nigricans is an autoimmune disease in which severe insulin resistance is caused by circulating antibodies that bind specifically to the insulin receptors on the cell surfaces.[12\u201314](#core-r012) Patients with this syndrome typically are overtly diabetic and usually have other signs of autoimmune disease. Hyperandrogenism is not a characteristic feature. Thus, the Type B syndrome of insulin resistance is improbable in this patient.The Type A syndrome of insulin resistance is characterized by hyperandrogenism with a clinical onset most often around the time of puberty, as in this case.[13](#core-r013) The hyperandrogenism may be sufficiently marked to suggest hyperthecosis or an ovarian neoplasm. Ovarian pathological findings are not available in most of these cases, but hyperthecosis and polycystic ovaries with multiple dermoid cysts have been reported.[15](#core-r015) The insulin resistance in these patients is of great interest. Some patients have symptomatic diabetes or normal glucose tolerance, but in all the cases there are high levels of endogenous insulin and resistance to exogenous insulin.[13](#core-r013) The normal range of fasting insulin values is up to about 15 \u03bcU, but this non-obese girl had a value of 60 \u03bcU per milliliter. The cellular basis for the insulin resistance in these patients has been studied in detail. It appears that the insulin resistance is due to a deficiency in the number of insulin receptors that their cells express.[13,16](#core-r013) or to an abnormality of early steps beyond receptor binding,[17](#core-r017) probably on a genetic basis. The coexistence of marked hyperandrogenism, acanthosis nigricans, and insulin resistance suggests that this patient had a syndrome related to this Type A syndrome of insulin resistance. It should be stressed that acanthosis nigricans was the only clinical sign pointing to the existence of insulin resistance in this patient. Because, as in this case, detection of insulin resistance may require measurement of plasma insulin levels and because, according to my experience, mild or moderate acanthosis nigricans is often not noted, the prevalence of this syndrome in a population of women with hyperandrogenism is not known. In preliminary studies Dr. Richard Eastman and I observed that 5 per cent of the women whom we evaluated for hyperandrogenism had acanthosis nigricans. Furthermore, all these women had resistance to endogenous insulin despite a normal glucose tolerance. In none of our cases had the acanthosis been commented upon by previous examiners. At this time we do not know the natural history of the insulin resistance in patients of this type or the long-term biochemical consequences of such clinically silent insulin resistance.The nature of the relation between insulin resistance and the ovarian disease in this syndrome merits comment. In one study of a group of women with polycystic ovarian disease the degree of insulin resistance was shown to correlate with the plasma levels of testosterone.[18](#core-r018) There is no direct evidence that testosterone or other androgens can cause tissue resistance to insulin directly, however. The failure of the insulin resistance to diminish after total oophorectomy in several cases leads me to believe that it is not a consequence of hyperandrogenism per se.In summary, I believe that this patient had a syndrome closely related to the Type A syndrome of insulin resistance with acanthosis nigricans. In my view, ovarian stromal hyperthecosis was the most likely cause of the hyperandrogenism, but a small ovarian neoplasm cannot be ruled out. I suspect that a laparotomy was the diagnostic procedure performed.Dr. William F. Crowley: Dr. Flier, will you comment further on the series of cases that you have studied with Dr. Eastman? I am particularly interested in the nature of their endocrine abnormalities. Which androgens were elevated?Dr. Flier: We studied 200 consecutive patients referred for evaluation of hyperandrogenism, with the usual symptoms and signs that lead to that diagnosis. All the patients were examined carefully for the presence or absence of acanthosis nigricans, and it was found in 10 of them. In most cases the skin lesion was mild, but all observers agreed that it was present, and in several women it was marked. Most of the patients were aware of the darkening of the skin and reported that it became evident at about the time that they began to notice the hirsutism. These patients also had clinical findings characteristic of the polycystic ovarian syndrome. They typically had a high-normal or slightly elevated testosterone level, and a subpopulation of them had a slightly elevated DHEA-sulfate level. The 17-ketosteroid values were high-normal or slightly elevated, and most of the patients had an increased LH-FSH ratio. These women were all somewhat overweight. However, we were unable to find a relation between the severity of the hyperandrogenism or the obesity and the degree of insulin resistance. The metabolic lesion responsible for this syndrome remains unknown. It is possible that an unknown primary defect independently causes both the ovarian and the insulin-action abnormalities. Alternatively, some aspect of the insulin-resistant state, perhaps at the level of the pituitary gland or the ovaries, may lead to the development of hyperandrogenism.Dr. Crowley: Do you think that there is an adrenal component in the disorder? We have seen some cases in which there appeared to be both ovarian and adrenal components.Dr. Flier: We have very few data on the extent of an adrenal component in this disorder. Patients with polycystic ovarian disease may have hypersensitivity of the adrenal gland to ACTH stimulation.[19](#core-r019) Speculation whether androgens alter various enzymatic pathways in the adrenal gland has been abundant. I don't know whether such a mechanism will prove to exist in patients with this syndrome.I might add that none of our patients with acanthosis nigricans were virilized, but all of them had mild to moderate hyperandrogenism. None were diabetic. All of them had a normal fasting blood glucose level, and most had normal results on glucose-tolerance testing. In fact, the only biochemical sign of insulin resistance was an elevated plasma insulin level. We know little about the natural history of the insulin resistance in these patients. It is clear that acanthosis nigricans, even of mild degree, is a marker for a subset of women with hyperandrogenism who have marked insulin resistance. We may wonder about the pathophysiologic basis for the acanthosis nigricans in this syndrome. Because the skin lesion is present in diverse conditions with target-cell resistance I believe that it is a cutaneous consequence of target-cell insulin resistance rather than a result of hyperandrogenism. The fact that many severely virilized women do not have acanthosis nigricans is consistent with this view.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Isn't there sometimes improvement in the acanthosis after the ovarian androgens are depressed?Dr. Flier: Yes, but that has not always been observed.Dr. Crowley: We have seen five patients with this syndrome, all of whom have gained weight early in the course, largely due to an increase in muscle mass. Many did not become obese, but there was a striking increment in their weight associated with the onset of acanthosis nigricans and hirsutism. All these abnormalities were subsequently progressive. We have thought that insulin is a nonspecific growth factor, with the skin as one of its potential target organs. The theca cells of the ovary may also be responding to the high levels of endogenous insulin.Dr. Flier: Insulin's ability to promote growth in a variety of tissues may not be due to binding to the typical metabolic insulin receptor. It appears probable that insulin promotes growth by binding to receptors for a variety of important growth factors,[20,21](#core-r020) some of which have major sequence homologies with insulin.[22](#core-r022) For this reason it is not surprising that hyperinsulinemic states with tissue resistance to the metabolic actions of insulin may be associated with stimulation of growth in various tissues. A group of insulin-resistant patients with acral changes suggestive of acromegaly has already been reported.[23](#core-r023)Dr. Scully: Dr. Calderwood, will you tell us the opinion of the medical students?Dr. Stephen B. Calderwood: They discussed virilizing adrenal and ovarian neoplasms but found no evidence of them. Their main considerations focused on the spectrum of polycystic ovarian disease and hyperthecosis of the ovaries. They reviewed past reports of the association of polycystic ovarian disease with insulin resistance and acanthosis nigricans but thought that the degree of virilization in this case was more than that commonly seen in polycystic ovarian disease. They believed that a biopsy of the ovary would have been useful in distinguishing hyperthecosis from polycystic disease.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Scully: Dr. Nikrui, will you describe the findings at laparotomy?Dr. Najmosama Nikrui: Exploration of the upper portion of the abdomen revealed no abnormality of the adrenal glands. The uterus and fallopian tubes were normal. The ovaries were slightly enlarged, 3 by 4 cm in diameter, and had thickened, grayish-white surfaces. No nodules were palpable, but multiple cysts were seen just below the surfaces ([Fig. 1](#f001)). Bilateral wedge resection was performed.Dr. Scully: We received two ovarian wedges. Microscopical examination revealed the features of polycystic ovarian disease as well as stromal hyperthecosis, but the findings were not entirely characteristic of either of these disorders. We found collagenization of the outer cortex, which explained the thickening of the ovarian surfaces, as well as multiple follicle cysts ([Fig. 2](#f002)). The walls of the cysts generally reflected the alteration in the FSH-LH ratio since they contained decreased numbers of granulosa cells, which are stimulated by FSH, and increased numbers of theca cells, which are stimulated by LH. The central areas of the ovaries had an unusual appearance, having been partly replaced by large areas of loose fibrotic stroma containing numerous atretic follicles ([Fig. 3](#f003) and [4](#f004)). The atretic follicles were partly surrounded by hyperplastic theca cells ([Fig. 5](#f005)). In other areas small groups of luteinized cells were in the stroma ([Fig. 6](#f006)), warranting the diagnosis of stromal hyperthecosis. Examination of the Stein\u2013Leventhal, or polycystic, ovary typically shows follicular hyperthecosis; when the luteinized cells are present in the stroma at a distance from follicular structures the process is called \"hyperthecosis\" or, more accurately, \"stromal hyperthecosis.\" Another interesting finding in these ovarian specimens was the presence of numerous small nests of granulosa cells that contained multiple Call\u2013Exner bodies ([Fig. 6](#f006)). One or a few of these nests are occasionally seen in normal ovaries, but they were present in a considerable number in these specimens. I am uncertain of their meaning in this pathophysiologic setting.I have recently examined ovarian specimens from nine other women with this syndrome. Stromal hyperplasia and stromal hyperthecosis of varying degrees were observed in all of them. The number of follicle cysts ranged from very few to many. Several of the specimens were characterized by prominent follicular atresia and stromal fibrosis, as observed in the case under discussion, and a few contained numerous small nests of granulosa cells.Dr. Crowley, will you give us the follow-up report?Dr. Crowley: Postoperatively, the testosterone level dropped to 73 ng per 100 ml, but the amenorrhea has persisted. The patient thought that there was a slight abatement of the acanthosis and the clitoral enlargement, but in my opinion the improvement was equivocal. She was so disappointed that her menses did not return in the six months after the operation that she failed to return for several follow-up appointments. She has been seen recently and found to have increased her weight and remained amenorrheic, with marked progression of the acanthosis. Oral contraceptive agents have been prescribed.Dr. Flier: A wedge resection usually fails to control the hyperandrogenism in patients with hyperthecosis, and one may have to resort to bilateral oophorectomy to arrest the progressive virilization.Dr. Crowley: The reason that wedge resection was done in this case was to eliminate the possibility of a coexisting stromal luteoma, which has occurred in one other case.[24](#core-r024)\n",

      "question": "A 61-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of increasing weakness in all his extremities.\nThe patient had been in good health until five years earlier, when weakness developed in the distal portion of the left leg, with mild pain in the left hip. He began to limp because of the weakness. There were severe muscle cramps in the leg, which subsided approximately two years later. Three years before admission a neurologist found distal muscular atrophy of the left leg, with normal reflexes and sensation, and normal cranial-nerve functions. Motor-nerve conduction velocities and sensory-nerve action potentials were normal. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the lumbar spine showed a very slight posterior bulge of the L3-4 disk space and herniations at the L4-5 and L5-S1 disk spaces. An MRI scan of the cranium was said to reveal a tiny area of bright signal in the left anterior parietal white matter close to its junction with the gray matter; no other abnormality was detected. Electromyographic examination showed spontaneous activity and denervation and reinnervation in both legs and in the right arm. A test for anti\u2013GM-1 ganglioside antibodies was negative.\nOne year before admission the patient was admitted to another hospital because of increasing weakness in the left leg. Examination revealed wasting and marked muscle weakness in the left leg and moderate weakness in the right leg and both arms. The tendon reflexes were normal except that the ankle jerks were absent. The plantar responses were flexor. Sensation was normal. Motor-nerve conduction velocities and sensory-nerve action potentials remained normal. Electromyographic examination disclosed changes characteristic of denervation. The results of routine hematologic and blood-chemistry studies were normal, as were the values for vitamin B\n12\n, folic acid, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and creatine kinase; the results of serum and urinary immunoelectrophoresis; and the serum concentrations of lead, mercury, and arsenic. The cerebrospinal fluid contained 1 white cell per cubic millimeter; the protein concentration was 65 mg per deciliter, and the glucose concentration was 61 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter). A computed tomographic study of the abdomen was normal. Microscopical examination of a specimen from a gastrocnemius-muscle biopsy revealed evidence of chronic and ongoing denervation; a sural-nerve biopsy was negative.\nSix months before admission the patient became wheelchair-bound. Three months later he was first seen at this hospital. He was a retired warehouse supervisor. The limb weakness was asymmetric but severe and involved both proximal and distal muscles. He had had fasciculations in all extremities and in the face for about one year and had lost approximately 32 kg in weight during the three or four years before admission. There was no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, fever, chills, sweats, dysarthria, dysphagia, headache, sensory symptoms, or incontinence of the bladder or bowel, and there was no family history of neuromuscular disorders. He used no medications. Dysarthria developed during the next three months. He was admitted to this hospital.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse was 76, and the respirations were 24. The blood pressure was 115/75 mm Hg.\nThe general physical examination was normal except for emaciation and + pedal edema. On neurologic examination the patient was alert and oriented, with mild dysarthria. The extraocular movements were normal, and the facial musculature and sensation were intact. The tongue was of normal bulk, with a midline protrusion. Fasciculations were present. No jaw jerk was elicited. Neck flexion and extension were preserved. The proximal and distal limb muscles were markedly atrophic. Fasciculations were noted in all extremities and the face. Muscle tone was normal in the extremities. Muscle strength (right/left) was as follows: deltoids, 4-/4-; biceps, triceps, and wrist extensors, 4-/3; extensor digitorum, 2/2; all intrinsic hand muscles, 3/3; hip flexion, 4-/4-; hip extension, 3/3; ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, 2/2; and ankle eversion and inversion, 3/3. Sensation of vibration, light touch, joint position, pinprick, and thermal stimuli was normal. The deep tendon reflexes were minimal in the arms, questionable at the knees, and unobtainable at the ankles because of weakness. The plantar responses could not be tested accurately.\nThe results of a complete blood count and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. The glucose concentration was 123 mg per deciliter (6.82 mmol per liter), the conjugated bilirubin concentration was 0.3 mg per deciliter (5 \u03bcmol per liter), and the total bilirubin concentration was 1.4 mg per deciliter (24 \u03bcmol per liter); the urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, protein, albumin, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations were normal. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and anti\u2013GM-1 ganglioside antibodies were negative; serum immunoelectrophoresis, immunoglobulin studies, and a test for urinary Bence Jones protein showed no abnormalities. The cerebrospinal fluid was acellular; the protein concentration was 53 mg per deciliter, and the glucose concentration was 77 mg per deciliter (4.3 mmol per liter). Motor-nerve conduction studies revealed low-amplitude or absent motor responses with normal conduction, and sensory-nerve conduction studies were normal. Stimulation of the cervical and lumbosacral roots, with the use of thigh and forearm target muscles, showed normal latencies without any evidence of conduction block. Cortical magnetic-stimulation studies showed normal excitation thresholds and conduction times. Electromyographic examination revealed widespread spontaneous activity and chronic denervation\u2013reinnervation in all extremities.\nHuman immunoglobulins were administered intravenously, and the patient was discharged to his home on the second hospital day. Three additional infusions were given at home on successive days.\nFive days after discharge the patient was found dead.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. William J. Triggs[\\*](#FN1): This man's fatal illness was characterized by progressive and generalized weakness without an elemental sensory disturbance. In the absence of upper-motor-neuron signs, the differential diagnosis includes diseases that affect the components of the motor unit: the muscle fiber, neuromuscular junction, peripheral nerve, and motor neuron. In this context I shall consider some of the findings pertaining to the clinical differential diagnosis before reviewing the neurophysiologic investigations.The distribution of the patient's muscular weakness does not suggest a muscular dystrophy. An inflammatory myopathy, such as polymyositis or inclusion-body myositis, can produce progressive proximal and distal weakness and may have been in the differential diagnosis before the neurophysiologic studies were performed. The widespread fasciculations observed in this patient, however, are atypical of muscle disease. Furthermore, muscle enzyme levels were normal, and a muscle biopsy showed no evidence of myopathy.There is also little in this patient's history to suggest a disease of the neuromuscular junction. Myasthenia gravis is a remote possibility in the absence of fatigability and ocular symptoms. In contrast, the Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome may produce progressive limb weakness, but it is usually proximal and occurs with minimal bulbar involvement. Other features of this syndrome, however, including increased strength with sustained effort, dry mouth, and areflexia, were absent in this case.An axonal polyneuropathy warrants little consideration in the absence of sensory signs or symptoms. Sensory abnormalities may require quantitative methods of detection in patients with inherited polyneuropathies but are usually prominent in those with acquired axonal polyneuropathies.[1](#core-r001) In this context the normal results of the sural-nerve biopsy are consistent with the patient's clinical presentation. However, I assume that the biopsy was performed in search of evidence of segmental demyelination. Progressive weakness is typical in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. Clinically similar polyradiculoneuropathy may be associated with serum monoclonal paraproteinemia and lymphoproliferative disorders. Most patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy have sensory signs and symptoms, areflexia, and elevated levels of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. The absence of these features and the progression of the illness during a five-year period in this case are strong evidence against a diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.In patients with progressive weakness confined to the upper or lower limbs, the differential diagnosis includes structural diseases of the spine and intrinsic diseases of the spinal cord, such as neoplasia and syringomyelia, at the appropriate segmental level. Such diseases affecting the nerve roots or spinal cord, however, should produce characteristic disturbances of sensation. Three years before the recent hospital admission, when this man's primary problem was weakness and atrophy of the left leg, MRI studies of his lumbar spine were unrevealing.I shall now discuss the results of the neurophysiologic investigations in this case. Sensory-nerve conduction studies were repeatedly negative. The results of motor-nerve conduction studies were initially normal but showed loss of amplitude in the compound muscle action potential late in the illness. Electromyographic examinations consistently showed evidence of active denervation and denervation\u2013reinnervation in multiple limbs and multiple muscles, which was not confined to the distribution of individual nerves or nerve roots. In summary, the results suggest a motor neuron disease,[2,3](#core-r002) and the results of the gastrocnemius-muscle biopsy are consistent with this diagnosis.[4](#core-r004)Did this patient have a motor neuron disease, however, or a motor neuropathy \u2014 diseases that Dyck[1](#core-r001) noted are not always separable? The clinical features of lower motor neuron disease during this patient's illness (cramps, fasciculation, and muscular atrophy) may also be observed in patients with motor neuropathy. Distal muscular atrophy may characterize either disorder at some stage of the illness. The clinical distinction between these entities is further obscured by the clinical evidence of upper-motor-neuron involvement in some patients with motor neuropathy.[5](#core-r005) Thus, the distinction between a motor neuron disease and a motor neuropathy may depend on nonclinical criteria, such as electrophysiologic or histopathological findings that implicate the peripheral nerve as opposed to the motor-neuron perikaryon.In the absence of distinguishing clinical characteristics, treatable motor neuropathies may be identified electrophysiologically in some patients by the presence of motor conduction block, defined optimally as a decrement in the area of the compound muscle action potential recorded across a local nerve segment, often accompanied by local slowing of the nerve conduction velocity. Patients with multiple areas of conduction block affecting motor but not sensory fibers are described as having multifocal motor neuropathy.[6](#core-r006) Many of these patients have elevated titers of anti\u2013GM-1 ganglioside antibodies. Increasing evidence supports the efficacy of immunosuppression in such patients.[6,7](#core-r006)May we review the results of the neurophysiologic motor investigations?Dr. Didier P. Cros: The motor studies were limited by the severe atrophy of intrinsic hand and foot muscles, which are generally used for testing. We therefore had to use target muscles in the forearms and thighs. Looking for conduction block, we stimulated the cervical and lumbosacral roots electrically, recorded from appropriate proximal target muscles, and compared the amplitude and area of the corresponding motor-evoked potentials with those evoked by stimulation of the appropriate peripheral nerves. In none of these examinations, which included studies of six target muscles, did we find evidence of primary demyelination of the peripheral motor fibers. We also performed cortical magnetic-stimulation studies using the same target muscles to test for abnormalities of the corticospinal motor pathways. A circular coil positioned over the vertex was used to stimulate the motor cortex. The conduction times to upper-extremity and lower-extremity muscles were normal. The excitation threshold for these muscles was normal as well. These findings strongly support the absence of primary demyelination of the motor fibers in the peripheral nervous system and differ from the typical findings in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disorder frequently detected by cortical magnetic-stimulation studies even when the upper motor neuron disease is subclinical.Dr. Triggs: In the absence of motor conduction block I shall conclude that this patient had a motor neuron disease, but several clinical syndromes that resemble motor neuron disease and may be associated with various toxic and metabolic perturbations affecting the motor neuron warrant brief consideration. These syndromes include conditions caused by exposure to heavy metals,[8](#core-r008) insulin-secreting tumors,[9](#core-r009) hyperparathyroidism,[10](#core-r010) hyperthyroidism,[11](#core-r011) and infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[12](#core-r012) This man, however, had no evidence of either exposure to toxins or endocrine dysfunction; the results of testing for antibodies to HIV are not available, but HIV infection is not a serious consideration in this case.The classification of this patient's illness on electrophysiologic grounds as a motor neuron disease rather than a motor neuropathy does not eliminate the possibility of an associated immunologic process. Motor neuron diseases have been associated with lymphoma,[13](#core-r013) plasma-cell dyscrasia, and antiganglioside antibodies in the absence of paraproteinemia.[7](#core-r007) The frequency of paraproteinemia is higher in patients with motor neuron disease who have a high protein concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (>75 mg per deciliter).[14](#core-r014) In a recent study, empirical bone marrow biopsies disclosed unsuspected lymphoma in 2 of 37 patients with motor neuron disease, 1 of whom did not have paraproteinemia[15](#core-r015); some of these patients improved after immunotherapy,[16,17](#core-r016) raising questions about the pathogenesis of motor neuron degeneration.The patient under discussion had no systemic or serologic evidence of a lymphoproliferative disorder; the results of serum immunoelectrophoresis were normal on several occasions, and two tests for anti\u2013GM-1 ganglioside antibodies were negative. Serum immunofixation is more sensitive than immunoelectrophoresis in detecting paraproteinemia.[14](#core-r014) Even without evidence of an associated immunologic process or motor conduction block, however, this patient's physicians treated him empirically with intravenously administered human immunoglobulins. I suspect that this decision was influenced by the obvious gravity of his illness, the relatively innocuous nature of the treatment, and the absence of upper-motor-neuron signs on neurologic examination.The clinical evidence of lower-motor-neuron degeneration without upper-motor-neuron signs in this patient also suggests the possibility of an inherited motor neuron disease or spinal muscular atrophy. In the absence of upper-motor-neuron signs, spinal muscular atrophy with the onset of symptoms in late adulthood may be indistinguishable from sporadic motor neuron disease. Indeed, lethal spinal muscular atrophy has been described in a family, with the onset of symptoms in the seventh decade of life in one member and during infancy in another.[18](#core-r018) The patient under discussion had no family history of neuromuscular disease. A chronic distal phenotype of spinal muscular atrophy can occur sporadically, but with the onset of symptoms before the age of 30 years[19](#core-r019) and a clinical progression over decades; severe disability is uncommon.In this case I might have considered the X-linked syndrome of bulbospinal muscular atrophy described by Kennedy et al.,[20](#core-r020) particularly because of the prominent muscle twitches in the face and tongue on admission. These facial-muscle twitches were described as fasciculations in the case presentation but result from grouped or high-frequency motor-unit discharges in patients with the Kennedy syndrome.[21](#core-r021) The age at the onset of symptoms and the clinical progression in this patient are atypical for that disorder. Bulbospinal muscular atrophy usually progresses over decades and is typically accompanied by tremor and gynecomastia. The results of sensory-nerve conduction studies are invariably abnormal, despite a paucity of clinically detectable sensory deficits.A syndrome of chronic spinal muscular atrophy has also been associated with hexosaminidase A deficiency.[22](#core-r022) The phenotype of adult gangliosidosis is variable, however, and symptoms usually begin well before the sixth decade. If this patient had had a family history of neurologic disease, an assessment of the level of serum hexosaminidase A would have been reasonable, but there was no such history.Motor neuron disease can be classified on the basis of clinical,[23,24](#core-r023) electrophysiologic, and pathological[4](#core-r004) evidence of the involvement of upper and lower motor neurons ([Table 1](#t01)). The patient under discussion had clinical and electrophysiologic evidence of the degeneration of the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord but no evidence of upper-motor-neuron involvement. On a clinical and electrophysiologic basis, then, this man had progressive muscular atrophy, but this diagnosis is not associated with a uniform pathological picture. Patients with progressive muscular atrophy infrequently have pathological findings limited to the lower motor neurons of the spinal cord,[4,25](#core-r004) and there may be clinical evidence of upper-motor-neuron involvement during the course of the illness.[26](#core-r026) Indeed, the pathological findings in patients with diseases that meet the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of progressive muscular atrophy are frequently indistinguishable from the findings in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, including the depletion of cortical motor neurons, with gliosis and degeneration of the corticospinal tract.[27\u201331](#core-r027)In patients with clinical signs of progressive muscular atrophy but pathological evidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the upper-motor-neuron findings are presumably obscured by the effects of lower-motor-neuron loss. For example, an extensor plantar response cannot be elicited if lower-motor-neuron innervation is insufficient to extend the great toe. One group of investigators has tried to account for the effects of lower-motor-neuron loss on clinical signs of upper-motor-neuron involvement; patients with such findings are classified as having \u201camyotrophic lateral sclerosis with probable upper-motor-neuron signs\u201d if the deep tendon reflexes are thought to be incongruously active or brisk relative to the degree of lower-motor-neuron impairment.[13,14](#core-r013) This classification scheme exemplifies both the importance and the difficulty of identifying upper-motor-neuron involvement in patients with motor neuron disease.Clinical studies have demonstrated substantial differences between progressive muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[23,24](#core-r023) As compared with patients who have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, those with a clinical diagnosis of progressive muscular atrophy are more likely to be male, are younger at the onset of symptoms, and survive longer. However, the basis for any of these differences is unclear in the absence of a correlation between clinical and pathological findings. For example, some patients with progressive muscular atrophy have a rapidly fatal clinical course, and their survival is the same as that of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This rapidly fatal course may reflect the involvement of upper motor neurons in some of these patients. Perhaps this involvement could even produce an ascertainment bias in the pathological assessment of patients with progressive muscular atrophy. Clearly, the ability to detect definite evidence of upper-motor-neuron involvement in living patients is important.It may be possible to assess cortical motor-neuron function physiologically with magnetic cortical stimulation. Merton and Morton[32](#core-r032) introduced transcranial electrical stimulation in 1980, and five years later Barker and his colleagues[33](#core-r033) introduced magnetic cortical stimulation with the use of a time-varying magnetic field to induce electric currents within the brain painlessly. Magnetic cortical stimulation has both excitatory and inhibitory effects on upper-motor-neuron function, which are readily observed in the surface electromyograms.[34](#core-r034) The short latency of the initial electromyographic response to cortical stimulation, referred to as the motor-evoked potential, indicates that this response is probably mediated by the activation of Betz's cells \u2014 large cortical motor neurons with monosynaptic connections to the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord. A variety of independent observations suggest that magnetic cortical stimulation activates these cortical motor neurons transsynaptically through thalamocortical and corticocortical afferents.[35](#core-r035) This technique should therefore be ideally suited for detecting the degeneration of cortical Betz's cells in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[31,36](#core-r031)Clinical experience suggests that magnetic cortical stimulation detects abnormalities of cortical motor-neuron function. In patients with a clinical diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the abnormality observed most consistently appears to be a relative inexcitability of central motor pathways; the excitation threshold for eliciting a motor-evoked potential is higher than the threshold in normal subjects,[37\u201339](#core-r037) or motor-evoked potentials may not be elicited at any level of stimulation.[40\u201342](#core-r040) Alterations in the inhibitory effects of magnetic cortical stimulation on electromyographic studies may also reflect abnormalities of upper-motor-neuron function in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[37,43,44](#core-r037) Some investigators using magnetic cortical stimulation have reported a moderate prolongation of central motor conduction times in such patients.[38,40\u201342](#core-r038) Abnormalities detected with magnetic cortical stimulation are often correlated with clinical evidence of upper-motor-neuron involvement but may reflect upper-motor-neuron involvement that is not evident clinically.[41](#core-r041) In patients with clinically evident amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the sensitivity of magnetic cortical stimulation appears to be high. On the other hand, the sensitivity of this technique for detecting upper-motor-neuron dysfunction in patients with motor neuron disease but without clinical signs of upper-motor-neuron involvement is unknown. Autopsy studies with magnetic cortical stimulation in patients with motor neuron disease have not been reported.Both the excitation threshold for eliciting a motor-evoked potential and the central motor conduction times were normal late in the course of this patient's illness, reflecting the physiologic integrity of the cortical Betz's cells and the lateral corticospinal tracts. I believe that the pathological diagnosis proved to be progressive muscular atrophy.Dr. Raymond D. Adams: The retention of tendon reflexes in the presence of severe muscular atrophy always raises the question of anterior-horn-cell disinhibition.Dr. Triggs: That is the issue in a patient such as this one. There are no conclusive methods of evaluating that possibility clinically. We hope that transcranial magnetic stimulation will provide an objective means of assessing upper-motor-neuron function independent of abnormalities in clinical reflexes, which will be useful for clinicians evaluating patients with motor neuron disease.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Mark A. Edgar: At autopsy no abnormalities were found in the cerebral hemispheres. The pathological findings were restricted to other portions of the brain and the spinal cord. The spinal anterior roots were markedly shrunken and brown; the lateral columns appeared normal. Microscopical examination showed that the anterior roots had a severe loss of myelinated axons, with occasional longitudinal collections of lipid-laden macrophages (\u201cdigestion chambers\u201d), suggesting active axonal degeneration ([Figure 1](#f01)). There was also a marked loss of large anterior horn cells, which were replaced by fibrillary astrocytes at all levels of the cord ([Figure 2](#f02)). The remaining neurons had eccentric nuclei and swollen cell bodies containing abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and a thin, peripherally displaced rim of Nissl's substance (i.e., chromatolysis). In other neurons there were glassy eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions of various shapes. Swollen proximal axons were easily found. A distinctive change was the presence of rounded eosinophilic bodies with pale halos, which were indistinguishable from the Lewy bodies in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, in terms of both the cell bodies and the swollen axonal processes ([Figure 3](#f03)). The motor nuclei of the lower brain stem (the trigeminal motor nucleus, facial nucleus, and hypoglossal nucleus) contained similar inclusions. The trigeminal motor nucleus had a single neuronophagic nodule. The corticospinal tract was normal at all levels of the neuraxis. Cytoplasmic inclusions were seen in some neurons of Clarke's column and in rare dorsal horn cells.The abnormalities in the lower motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord, without morphologic evidence of damage to the corticospinal pathways, led to a diagnosis of lower motor neuron disease (i.e., progressive muscular atrophy). This finding correlates well with the antemortem electrophysiologic studies, which showed no evidence of upper-motor-neuron involvement. Progressive muscular atrophy accounts for approximately 2 percent of all cases of motor neuron disease. Unlike other classes of motor neuron disease, it affects males eight times more frequently than females.[7](#core-r007)Various eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions have been seen in motor neuron disease.[45\u201347](#core-r045) The best known of these inclusions is the Bunina body, 2 to 6 \u03bcm in diameter, which was first described in cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and subsequently detected in sporadic cases. Glassy cytoplasmic inclusions, chromatolytic neurons, and Lewy-like bodies are most characteristic of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[48](#core-r048) The origin of these structures is unclear; chromatolytic neurons and swollen axons reflect the accumulation of phosphorylated neurofilament protein arranged in parallel or interlacing bundles,[49](#core-r049) whereas both Lewy bodies and Lewy-like bodies consist mainly of ubiquitinated neurofilament protein arranged in spherical aggregates. However, these various inclusions are not specific to particular classes of motor neuron disease; Lewy-like bodies especially have been described in the setting of lower motor neuron disease.[50](#core-r050) One common feature in cases of lower motor neuron disease with Lewy-like bodies is a rapidly progressive course. Whether these inclusions are in some way pathogenic or simply a reflection of diseased motor neurons is unknown.Dr. John S. Barlow: What was the cause of this patient's death?Dr. Edgar: The only structural abnormality that could have caused his death was severe diaphragmatic atrophy; his death was therefore attributed to ventilatory failure.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Steven Jay Isakoff\n(Hematology\u2013Oncology): A 32-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient cancer center at this hospital because of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast.\nThe patient had been well until 2 months before admission, when she became aware of a crease in the upper outer portion of her right breast, which she thought was caused by a blocked milk duct, since she was breast-feeding. Approximately 3 weeks before this evaluation, she saw her gynecologist for a routine appointment; on examination, a mass was palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Mammography performed at another hospital reportedly showed a heterogeneous spiculated mass, approximately 2 cm in diameter, in the right breast, with thickening of the skin; ultrasonography revealed a large area of hyperechogenicity in the region of the palpable mass. Four days later, a core needle biopsy of the breast mass was performed. Pathological examination of the specimen revealed invasive ductal carcinoma (moderately differentiated, without lymphatic-vessel invasion) and ductal carcinoma in situ (intermediate-to-high nuclear grade with involvement of the lobules). Immunohistochemical staining showed overexpression (3+) of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2); testing for estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor proteins was negative. The next day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breasts, after the administration of gadolinium, revealed dense breasts with marked enhancement. The T\n2\n-weighted images showed an area of decreased attenuation, 2 cm in diameter with spiculated borders, in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, and low enhancement as compared with adjacent breast parenchyma; this was suggestive of peripheral rim enhancement. The images also showed a possible second mass, 1.6 cm in diameter. Two days later, a second ultrasonogram of the right breast showed an additional, more anterior, hypoechoic mass, 1.6 cm by 1.1 cm by 2 cm, in the upper outer quadrant, with irregular borders and increased vascular flow. Testing for mutations in the genes\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\nwas reportedly negative.\nSix days before this presentation, positron-emission\u2013tomographic scanning, performed at the other hospital after the administration of 17 mCi of\n18\nF-fluorodeoxyglucose, showed extensive metabolic activity in the right breast and two small foci of activity in the right axilla, thought to represent metastases to lymph nodes. There was also a subtle focus of increased metabolic activity involving the tip of the left scapula. The patient came to the cancer center at this hospital for advice regarding treatment.\nThe patient reported no weight loss, fever, fatigue, headache, changes in vision, nipple discharge, breast or chest pain, erythema, or shortness of breath. Menarche had occurred at age 11 years; she was currently menstruating. She had taken oral contraceptives for 3 to 4 years in the past, and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had been administered intermittently for less than 4 years. Her first full-term pregnancy occurred when she was 23 years of age and was complicated by idiopathic thrombocytopenia; she had had two cesarean sections and had three children. She had a history of endometriosis and had had several orthopedic procedures. Medications included carbamazepine, calcium, and vitamins. She had no known allergies. She lived with her husband and children (the youngest was 14 months of age) and did not work outside the home. She drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke. Three maternal relatives had had breast cancer \u2014 a maternal second cousin when in her 40s and two maternal great-aunts (one when in her 60s). Her paternal grandfather had lung cancer at 85 years of age, and her paternal grandmother had colon cancer.\nOn examination, the vital signs were normal and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.7. There was a mass, 6 to 7 cm in diameter, in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast that extended subareolarly, and the overlying skin had peau d'orange changes, without erythema. There was no bone tenderness, including in the left scapula, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 3800 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); the rest of the complete blood count and differential count were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin and tests of renal and liver function. The next day, a bone scan performed at the other hospital showed no evidence of metastatic disease.\nOne week later, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, showed marked enlargement of the right breast and thickening of the overlying skin, small right axillary lymph nodes (<1 cm in diameter), and a nonspecific nodule (2 mm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the left lung. There was a small area of mixed lucency and patchy sclerosis in the inferior tip of the right scapula. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of contrast material, revealed multiple solid hepatic lesions (\u22641.6 cm in diameter), which were thought to be metastases. Results of transthoracic echocardiography were normal.\nManagement decisions were made.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Jos\u00e9 Baselga:* May we review the imaging studies?*Dr. Elizabeth A. Rafferty:* The mammogram showed a spiculated mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast that corresponded to the palpable abnormality. Ultrasound examination of the corresponding region of the breast showed an irregular hypoechoic mass, 2.2 cm in maximal dimension, with posterior acoustic shadowing and some associated skin thickening. These mammographic and ultrasonographic results were highly suspicious for cancer.A breast MRI was performed. The patient's lactational state caused extensive background enhancement; however, there were two spiculated, enhancing masses at the 10 o'clock axis of the right breast ([Figure 1A](#f01)). The more posterior mass, corresponding to the palpable lump, was approximately 2 cm in greatest dimension. The more anterior mass, previously unsuspected, was 1.8 cm. Its presence was confirmed with ultrasonography, and a biopsy specimen was obtained with ultrasound guidance.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Alessandro Bombonati:* Examination of the initial biopsy specimen of the mass from the right breast revealed invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3 of 3, spanning at least 1.0 cm. A small focus of high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ involving a few ducts was also present. No lymphatic or blood-vessel invasion was identified ([Figure 2A and 2B](#f02)). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the tumor cells were negative for both estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor proteins and there was strong (3+) overexpression of HER2 ([Figure 2C](#f02)).*Dr. Rafferty:* A CT scan of the abdomen ([Figure 1B](#f01)) showed multiple liver lesions, at least eight in the right lobe, the largest of which was 1.6 cm in diameter, and a single lesion in the left lobe. The lesions were consistent with hepatic metastases.\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Baselga:* This young woman has a locally advanced, HER2-positive breast cancer with probable metastatic disease to the liver. This case illustrates a number of issues that clinicians face in the care of patients with metastatic breast cancer and of patients with HER2-positive tumors. *HER2,* a proto-oncogene encoding the HER2 tyrosine kinase receptor, is amplified in 15 to 20% of patients with breast cancer, resulting in HER2-receptor overexpression and an aggressive clinical phenotype associated with high metastatic potential and shortened survival. [1](#core-r001) Fortunately, during the past decade, the outcome of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer has markedly improved with the advent of molecular targeting of the HER2 receptor with the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech). [2,3](#core-r002) Since the benefit of trastuzumab therapy is strictly limited to HER2-positive breast cancer, the HER2 status is now tested in every patient with newly diagnosed breast cancer. A joint guideline by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists recommends that the determination of HER2 positivity by either immunohistochemical analysis or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) be carried out only in validated laboratories.[4](#core-r004) In this case, the tumor was found to be positive by immunohistochemical analysis, as defined by uniform, intense membrane staining in more than 30% of invasive cells. Since HER2 status was determined in a validated laboratory, performing FISH would not have been of additional value.[5](#core-r005)Another initial consideration in this case is whether the patient's physicians should obtain histologic confirmation of metastatic disease in the liver. Accurate assessment of the presence of metastatic disease in patients with breast cancer is critically important, since the presence of metastatic disease converts a potentially curable cancer to a noncurable disease and is associated with substantially different treatment goals. Histologic confirmation of metastatic disease should be strongly considered in some cases, such as those in which there are a small number of potentially metastatic lesions, the lesions are in an unusual site, or the primary tumor has a low inherent risk of metastasis. However, in my opinion, there is little question that this patient had metastatic disease, since she presented with at least eight space-occupying lesions in the liver and such metastases are commonly associated with HER2-positive breast cancers. However, in the unlikely event of a dissociated response to therapy between the primary tumor and the liver lesions, a liver biopsy should be considered at that time.Trastuzumab will be the backbone of therapy for this patient with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Although trastuzumab administered as a single agent has antitumor activity,[2,6,7](#core-r002) the highest clinical benefit is observed when tras-tuzumab is given in combination with chemotherapy. Multiple agents in combination with trastuzumab have shown clinical activity.[8](#core-r008) However, the only randomized trials that have shown improved survival are those involving the use of taxanes, [3,9](#core-r003) and therefore, I would recommend a taxane-containing regimen for this patient. In summary, in this patient with newly diagnosed HER2-positive, hormone-receptor\u2013negative metastatic breast cancer, my choice would be systemic therapy with trastuzumab and a taxane.*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): Dr. Younger, would you tell us how you treated this patient?*Dr. W. Jerry Younger* (Hematology\u2013Oncology): Because of published data suggesting the efficacy of carboplatin in addition to taxanes and trastuz-umab,[10,11](#core-r010) we chose to treat the patient with carboplatin, docetaxel, and trastuzumab, administered at 3-week intervals. After two cycles, we were pleased that on physical examination it was difficult to feel the mass and the skin changes had subsided. After four cycles, imaging studies showed complete resolution of all disease in the liver. The axillary disease had also resolved. The patient received a total of eight cycles of treatment and then continued trastuzumab as monotherapy. One year after the initiation of treatment, we repeated the imaging studies.*Dr. Baselga:* In this patient, therapy consisted of a combination of carboplatin, docetaxel, and trastuzumab. Although both preclinical studies and phase 2 clinical trials, as well as a subset analysis of a small phase 3 study, suggested a synergistic effect with the combination of platinum derivatives and trastuzumab, a recent and larger phase 3 study has shown that the addition of carboplatin to taxanes and trastuzumab may result in more toxic effects and no improvement in any efficacy end points.[12](#core-r012) The results of this study also remind us that new combination therapies should be shown to be superior in randomized clinical trials before they are implemented in daily clinical practice.*Dr. Rafferty:* On restaging examinations a year after the initiation of treatment, an abdominal CT scan showed resolution of all the hepatic lesions, with the exception of the single lesion in the left lobe ([Figure 1D](#f01)). To further characterize the hepatic mass in the left lobe, an MRI was obtained and showed the lesion to be hypointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and nonenhancing, features consistent with a simple cyst.A repeat mammogram showed extensive pleomorphic calcifications associated with a vague mass involving most of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Ultrasound examination at the 10 o'clock position showed a small residual mass. Breast MRI ([Figure 1C](#f01)) showed an irregular area of enhancement, up to 5.4 cm in greatest dimension, extending from the upper outer quadrant to the upper inner quadrant of the right breast. The enhancement on MRI probably reflects a combination of residual tumor and inflammatory response to neoadjuvant therapy.*Dr. Baselga:* This patient had a remarkable response to therapy, with complete remission of disease in all known metastatic sites. Although an overall response of HER2-positive metastatic disease to first-line therapy occurs in up to 70% of patients,[12](#core-r012) complete remissions, such as the one observed in this patient, are seen in only 7 to 8% of patients. Nonetheless, the remissions can be long-lasting; some patients who participated in the initial clinical trials with trastuzumab are still in remission more than 15 years later.[2,13](#core-r002) In this patient, the role of local therapy to the primary tumor now has to be considered. Although surgical resection of the primary tumor has traditionally been reserved for symptom palliation, retrospective series suggest a survival benefit associated with removal of the primary tumor in metastatic disease.[14](#core-r014) A case-matched series from this hospital suggests clinical benefit from local therapy in carefully selected patients with metastatic disease. [15](#core-r015) This patient clearly belongs in the category of patients who are likely to benefit from local therapy.*Dr. Barbara Lynn Smith:* This patient's cytotoxic chemotherapy and trastuzumab treatment resulted in complete resolution of her liver metastases, according to imaging studies; the response was maintained for more than 12 months. Despite the response at the sites of metastatic disease, she had residual disease in her right breast. On clinical examination, she had a 2-cm suspicious mass in the right breast; imaging studies revealed an even more extensive area of concern. In the past, surgery was rarely performed for patients such as this one with metastatic disease, largely because of concern that recuperation or disfigurement from surgery created an excessive burden when life expectancy was short. Surgery was generally reserved for palliation of symptoms caused by large primary tumors that did not respond to systemic therapy. However, the median survival for patients with metastatic breast cancer is now 12 to 42 months, because of improved therapies and earlier identification of metastatic disease.[16](#core-r016) Furthermore, during the past decade, retrospective studies have suggested a survival benefit among patients with stage IV breast cancer who underwent resection of the primary tumor.[14,17,18](#core-r014) A case\u2013control study from this hospital suggests that the observed survival benefit results from selection bias, with surgery preferentially performed in patients with a better prognosis, including those with fewer metastases and those who had a previous response to systemic therapy.[15](#core-r015)In thinking about the role of surgery in this patient, we recognized that survival in stage IV breast cancers is linked to the pattern and extent of metastases and to the biology of the tumor. Median survival is shorter in patients, such as this one, who have visceral metastases than in those who have bone-only metastases. [19](#core-r019) However, this patient has a HER2-positive tumor, which means that prolonged therapy with trastuzumab could control tumor progression while allowing a good quality of life during treatment. In patients in whom systemic therapies effectively control metastatic disease and are associated with acceptable adverse-event rates, it is increasingly common to see progression of the primary tumor within the breast. In some cases, the primary tumor becomes the main source of the patient's symptoms, requiring reconsideration of surgery. Surgical resection of the primary tumor is often preferable to the addition of more toxic systemic therapies and provides more reliable local control.In this patient, we were concerned that single-agent trastuzumab therapy would not prevent progression of the tumor in her breast. She was young, with an excellent performance status, and was likely to have a sufficient survival benefit such that local control would be relevant. We also hoped to avoid additional cytotoxic chemotherapy for as long as possible. For that reason, we performed a mastectomy of the right breast and immediate breast reconstruction.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Bombonati:* Gross examination of the mastectomy specimen, obtained after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 14 months after the initial biopsy, showed a dominant mass (6.0 cm in greatest dimension) and two adjacent poorly defined masses (1.8 cm and 0.6 cm in greatest dimensions) in the upper outer quadrant. Histologic examination showed foci of residual invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3 of 3, spanning an area of at least 2.5 cm on tissue sections ([Figure 3A](#f03)), as well as extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, grade 3 of 3, with comedonecrosis and calcifications ([Figure 3B](#f03)). Ductal carcinoma in situ extended to 0.15 cm from the anterior margin in one focus. Ten axillary lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma. Additional histologic findings included loose fibrohistiocytic stromal changes that were consistent with a tumor bed chemotherapeutic effect ([Figure 3C](#f03)) and an area of fibrosis with hemosiderin deposition and hemosiderin-laden macrophages consistent with a healing biopsy site. No lymphatic or blood-vessel invasion was identified. Repeat immunohistochemical studies for hormone receptors and HER2 confirmed the initial tumor phenotype. FISH performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue revealed *HER2* amplification in tumor cells ([Figure 2D](#f02)).\n\nDiscussion of Additional Management\n-----------------------------------\n\n*Dr. Baselga:* Fourteen months after the diagnosis, the patient had no documented residual or recurrent disease. Should she continue trastuzumab treatment, and if so, for how long? The appropriate duration of single-agent trastuzumab maintenance therapy is unknown. The decision to stop trastuzumab therapy, which is mostly devoid of long-term side effects, is not easy in patients who have a response to therapy. However, trastuzumab administration is expensive, with a cost upwards of $40,000 per year. Small series have shown long-term disease-free survival in patients with metastatic disease who have stopped trastuzumab after successful local\u2013regional treatment of the primary tumor.[20](#core-r020) Therefore, it would not be unreasonable to stop the administration of trastuzumab at some point if this patient's remission continues.One must keep in mind that relapse occurs in most patients and will most likely occur in this patient. In that case, there would be a number of therapeutic options available to the patient. HER2-positive tumors that recur after the cessation of trastuzumab continue to respond to anti-HER2 therapies, including trastuzumab. Options would include resuming the administration of trastuz-umab and adding another chemotherapy agent such as capecitabine,[21](#core-r021) the introduction of anti-HER2 small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in combination with either chemotherapy[22](#core-r022) or trastuzumab itself,[23](#core-r023) or participation in available clinical trials with a second generation of anti-HER2 agents such as anti-HER2 antibody\u2013drug conjugates[24](#core-r024) or inhibitors of HER2 dimerization.[25](#core-r025)Although the disease may recur in multiple sites, trastuzumab-treated populations have an especially high risk of central nervous system metastasis \u2014 more than 30% of the patients in some series.[26\u201328](#core-r026) The high rate of metastatic disease to the brain is probably due to the high invasive and metastatic potential of HER2-positive breast cancer, together with the limited penetration of trastuzumab across the blood\u2013brain barrier. We are unaware of any data that support early screening, despite the high risk of brain metastasis. In a small study involving MRI screening of the brain in 80 patients with HER2-positive disease that had metastasized elsewhere, asymptomatic brain metastases were detected in 36% of the patients. Although these patients were treated with whole-brain radiation therapy, survival was not prolonged.[29](#core-r029) After receiving whole-brain radiation, patients with HER2-positive brain metastasis have a survival advantage over patients with HER2-negative disease who also received whole-brain radiation.[30](#core-r030) This may be an indication that HER2-positive tumors may have enhanced sensitivity to radiation therapy. On balance, I would not screen this patient (by performing imaging studies) for the presence of brain metastases, but I would be clinically vigilant and would order imaging studies if neurologic abnormalities appear.*Dr. Younger:* We have continued trastuzumab monotherapy. It has now been 1.5 years since the mastectomy and 2.5 years since diagnosis, and the patient has no evidence of recurrence of the disease. We are not screening the central nervous system, but an MRI scan of the brain, obtained because of transient neurologic symptoms, was negative.*Dr. Harris:* Are there any questions?*Dr. William U. Shipley* (Radiation Oncology): Would you be interested in using sequential analysis of circulating tumor cells to decide possible subsequent therapy?*Dr. Baselga:* We now have the capacity to detect the presence of circulating tumor cells in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The next steps will be to monitor the presence of circulating tumor cells and, more important, to be able to \u201cinterrogate\u201d these cells for potential mechanisms of resistance and to determine their sensitivity to different HER2-targeted therapies.*Dr. Harris:* How does trastuzumab enhance the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines?*Dr. Baselga:* The heart depends on HER2 signaling to recover from a number of insults, including the cardiotoxic effects induced by anthracyclines. Therapy with trastuzumab prevents HER2 from signaling appropriately in the heart and may be responsible for the enhanced cardiac toxic effects observed when anthracyclines are given in combination with trastuzumab.*Dr. Isakoff:* Would you consider prophylactic cranial irradiation to reduce the risk of recurrence in the brain?*Dr. Baselga:* That is the subject of considerable debate. One has to weigh the potential long-term side effects of prophylactic whole-brain irradiation, including cognitive impairment, in a patient such as this one who has a potentially long survival. In addition, we do not have any evidence that prophylactic total-brain irradiation improves survival or even quality of life. To address this question, we would need to conduct a randomized, clinical trial, but this would be challenging for a number of reasons. Therefore, I would not recommend prophylactic brain irradiation for this patient.\n",

      "question": "A 34-year-old right-handed woman was admitted to the hospital because of progressive confusion and visual loss.\nThe patient had been well until four months earlier, when her family observed a reduction in spontaneous speech, increasing timidity, and confusion during her fourth pregnancy. Two months before admission she was unable to sign checks reliably, although it was unclear whether the problem was related to her vision or confusion. She began to report a persistent right frontal headache. Three weeks before admission, she had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery at another hospital. Two days later, she could not sign her name because of poor vision. Ophthalmologic evaluation showed bilateral visual impairment. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the brain showed diffuse white-matter disease. She was sent home, where she became sedentary and walked only with assistance. During the four days before admission, she experienced a mild right frontal headache. On the day of admission, she refused to descend the stairs at home and was brought to this hospital.\nThe patient was a native of the Azores and had immigrated to the United States 22 years before admission. Her parents, three sisters, husband, and four children were well. There was no history of head trauma, fever, meningitis, viral illness, recent receipt of vaccines, seizures, rash, arthralgia, recent travel, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, spontaneous abortions, use of tobacco or alcohol, or known risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and there was no family history of dementia, ocular disease, or stroke.\nThe temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the pulse was 89, and the respirations were 16. The blood pressure was 100/65 mm Hg.\nThe results of a general examination were normal. On neurologic evaluation, the patient thought that she was in a hospital in her home city. She could not state the current date or her date of birth. Her speech was fluent, with occasional slurring, but slowed and hypophonic, with perseveration. She recalled none of three objects at five minutes; calculation and left\u2013right discrimination were poor. A right afferent pupillary defect was present. The right pupil was 6 mm in diameter, and the left was 5 mm; both reacted to light. The patient could detect hand motion with the right eye and count fingers with the left eye but could not read letters with either eye. Dyschromatopsia was present; a pigmented lesion surrounded by an atrophic scar at the right macula was considered to be consistent with a remote history of toxoplasma infection.\nExamination of the optic disks revealed bilateral temporal pallor that was more extensive on the right side. The patient did not blink in response to a visual threat. No opticokinetic reflexes were elicited by horizontal or vertical testing. The extraocular movements were full. The remaining cranial nerves appeared normal. There was increased tone in the arms and legs, with paratonia and spasticity in the legs. No startle myoclonus was found. Muscle strength was normal throughout the body. The patient moved her left arm less often than her right; when asked to raise the left arm or both arms, she consistently raised the right arm. Sensitivity to pinprick was intact. The deep-tendon reflexes were +++ and symmetric, except that the right knee jerk was ++++, with right patellar and bilateral ankle clonus. The plantar responses were flexor. A bilateral Hoffmann's sign, an exaggerated jaw jerk, and a snout reflex were elicited. No ataxia was detected on finger-to-nose testing. The gait was abnormal, a finding consistent with the presence of visual impairment.\nThe urine was normal. The results of routine hematologic and blood chemical tests were normal. Toxic screening of serum was negative. Radiographs of the chest were normal. MRI of the brain obtained before the administration of gadolinium showed patchy, confluent white-matter changes and focal tissue loss in the medial occipital lobes and inferior left parietal lobe (\nFigure 1\nand\nFigure 2\n). After the administration of gadolinium, there was subcortical enhancement in the left occipital, left parietal, and right frontal lobes (\nFigure 3\n). An electroencephalographic examination, performed while the patient was awake, revealed generalized slowing of the background without focal features.\nA lumbar puncture was performed (\nTable 1\n). An MRI examination of the spine, performed without the administration of gadolinium, showed a normal spinal cord. A percutaneous carotid and vertebral angiographic study revealed no evidence of cerebral vasculitis. The immunoglobulin levels were as follows: IgG, 1380 mg per deciliter; IgA, 326 mg per deciliter; and IgM, 151 mg per deciliter. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a slight, diffuse increase in immunoglobulins. Levels of antithrombin III, protein C, protein S total antigen, and factor VIII were normal. Protein S activity was 64 percent, a finding consistent with the recent pregnancy. The value for activated protein C resistance was borderline low at 2.2. A polymerase-chain-reaction test for the factor V Leiden mutation showed that the patient was heterozygous for the mutation, with a greatly increased risk of a thrombotic event during pregnancy. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:80, with a speckled pattern. Tests for rheumatoid factor and lupus anticoagulant and for anticardiolipin (IgG and IgM), anti-Ro, anti-La, HIV, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative, as was a serologic test for syphilis.\nAcetaminophen, ibuprofen, and a daily multivitamin tablet were administered. The temperature rose to 37.6\u00b0C on one day and was otherwise normal. At times, the patient denied blindness and confabulated. On the fourth hospital day, she was unable to distinguish hand motions and had no perception of light. On the sixth hospital day, a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain showed hypodense lesions corresponding to the hyperintense white-matter lesions noted on the T\n2\n-weighted MRI scans.\nMicroscopical examination of a specimen from an MRI-guided stereotactic biopsy of the frontal lobe showed mild-to-moderate leptomeningeal fibrosis, with scanty chronic inflammation. Within the cortex and white matter were multiple small perivascular cuffs of lymphocytes, which extended into the adjacent parenchyma (\nFigure 4\n), with moderate-to-severe microglial proliferation (\nFigure 5\n). Extensive neuronal loss was not seen. Scattered reactive astrocytes were present in the gray and white matter (\nFigure 6\n). Myelin was preserved, and macrophages were absent in the white matter. Occasional cortical neurons contained neurofibrillary tangles (\nFigure 7\n). No nuclear or cytoplasmic inclusions were seen in neurons or glia.\nA diagnostic report was received.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Generoso G. Gascon[\\*](#FN1): The possible causes of this patient's subcortical presenile dementia must explain the visual problems, which may have been central or peripheral, as well as the gait problems, headache, subacute course, and diffuse white-matter disease. Since the MRI findings do not support the presence of a mass lesion, there must be another explanation for the right frontal headache.Could this patient have had cerebral multiple sclerosis or Beh\u00e7et's disease? Multiple sclerosis can be associated with plaques involving the centrum semiovale, but its presentation is more likely to mimic an acute organic psychosis. Also, it usually presents in patients younger than this woman, and remission occurs after a much shorter interval than the four-month course in this case. To rule out the diagnosis, however, it would be necessary to perform the usual diagnostic studies for multiple sclerosis and determine whether the white-matter lesions seen on MRI were plaques. Beh\u00e7et's disease resembles multiple sclerosis and may present as a progressive dementia with prominent white-matter findings in T2-weighted sequences on MRI. One cannot make that diagnosis, however, in the absence of its typical oculocutaneous signs \u2014 uveitis, keratitis, and oral and genital ulcers.Did the disease in this patient represent the onset in adulthood of a disease usually seen in childhood, such as one of the hereditary forms of leukodystrophy, which includes adult-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, globoid-cell (Krabbe's) leukodystrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, or Pelizaeus\u2013Merzbacher disease? The last two are unlikely because they are X-linked autosomal recessive diseases and therefore occur in males and because the disease in this case is too fully expressed to consider the patient a symptomatic heterozygote. A more likely possibility is adult-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, which usually develops in the third or fourth decade of life as a progressive dementia or neuropsychiatric disorder, such as schizophrenia, with or without peripheral neuropathy. MRI may show generalized atrophy and diffuse symmetric white-matter lesions, with high-intensity signals in periventricular regions on T2-weighted images. Late-onset Krabbe's disease usually presents with cortical blindness, optic atrophy, and spasticity that impairs gait. CT and MRI studies may demonstrate degenerative white-matter changes in the occipital and parietal lobes, which progress anteriorly. In both metachromatic leukodystrophy and Krabbe's disease, the total protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid is elevated, and in this case it was slightly elevated. The course of illness in this patient, however, was more rapid than the usual course of adult-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy or Krabbe's disease. The history alone does not rule out adult-onset Canavan's disease. It is now easily diagnosed by demonstrating the presence of acetylaspartic acid in urine, the absence of *N*-acetylaspartic acid activity on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or deficient aspartoacylase enzyme activity in cultured skin fibroblasts. One can even identify the gene mutation responsible for this disease.The patient's prominent visual problems suggest the autosomal recessive diseases called \u201cfamilial amaurotic idiocies,\u201d a 19th-century term. These are principally gray-matter or cortical neuronal diseases, however, with seizures that are usually myoclonic and are prominent very early in life. In adults, GM2 gangliosidoses present as dystonia, ataxia, or peripheral neuropathy rather than as prominent dementia.Finally, among genetic neurometabolic diseases, one must consider a mitochondrial disorder such as mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. Its symptoms are usually intermittent, rather than relentlessly progressive. The course of the illness in this patient and the absence of a family history of dementia, ocular disease, or stroke militate against this diagnosis, as does the normal lactate level in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, to rule out this diagnosis, one could test for the associated DNA mutations or for abnormal oxidative phosphorylation usually in muscle.Rather than a genetic or familial disease, could the patient have had a parasitic or infectious disease that she acquired in the Azores? Neurocysticercosis is probably the most common parasitic disease of the central nervous system in immigrants with chronic symptoms, usually seizures. Its clinical picture is relatively benign, however, despite striking neuroradiologic images, and the MRI study in this case shows no brain cysts.This woman's progressive disease after 22 years of good health in this country suggests a long latent period after exposure to a pathogen here or abroad. Progressive rubella encephalitis may appear 10 years after exposure. Cerebrospinal fluid tests show an increased protein level and a marked increase in the IgG level, with rubella-specific oligoclonal antibodies. The associated dementia is usually followed by ataxia and myoclonic seizures, however, and would be extremely unusual at this woman's age. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy usually complicates a disease that causes immunosuppression, such as lymphoma, leukemia, or the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is unlikely that this woman had an unrecognized lymphoma or leukemia, and since she had no risk factors for HIV infection and her HIV test was negative, AIDS is also unlikely.Difficult diagnostic problems are generally posed by uncommon diseases or uncommon presentations of common diseases. In this case, we may have an uncommon presentation of an uncommon disease: subacute sclerosing panencephalitis presenting in adulthood with prominent visual symptoms.This patient's speech was not aphasic but characteristic of a frontal-lobe deficit. Her perseveration, dyscalculia, and left\u2013right disorientation probably reflected a dementia. Her exaggerated jaw jerk suggests pseudobulbar palsy. We are not told of grasping or rooting responses, the primitive neonatal reflexes that emerge in cases of frontal-lobe dementia. There is no mention of palmomental reflexes, but a snout reflex was present.The temporal pallor reflects optic atrophy, which may be retrobulbar or due to retrograde degeneration from involvement of optic radiations or tracts. The patient's blindness was confirmed by the absence of opticokinetic nystagmus, and she had Anton's syndrome (denial of blindness).Motor examination showed the findings expected with prefrontal involvement rather than involvement of the primary motor cortex: paratonic rigidity (gegenhalten) but no weakness. The patient neglected the left side of her body. A left hemiplegia was unlikely, because the deep-tendon reflexes were mostly symmetric, and where they were asymmetric, the right side (knee jerk) was more pronounced. It is curious that the plantar responses were flexor when so many upper-motor-neuron signs were bilateral, including Hoffmann's sign, an exaggerated jaw jerk, and ankle clonus.What was remarkable about the examination, if the patient had subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, was the absence of periodic myoclonus. Myoclonus can present as a difficulty in gait, periodic dropping of the head, and falling. It is characteristic of stage 2 subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and can be diagnosed at the bedside by counting the seconds between spasms. The spasms may be subtle early in the disease but can be elicited by having the patient stand with feet together and arms held forward and then watching for periodic dropping of the head, neck, trunk, or arms, which are often concomitant with very slow eye blinks.The optic findings, particularly the pigmented lesion surrounded by an atrophic scar at the right macula, were remarkable because of their prominence. This lesion is consistent with the macular pigmentary chorioretinitis and degeneration characteristic of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis ([Table 2](#t02)). Ocular changes[1](#core-r001) occur in up to 50 percent of patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and are usually concurrent with neurologic symptoms, but visual symptoms may precede neurologic symptoms by many years.[2](#core-r002)The most remarkable laboratory finding is the IgG level of 22.2 mg per deciliter in the cerebrospinal fluid, which accounts for more than half the total protein in the cerebrospinal fluid and suggests the presence of syphilis or subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The findings in this case are too severe for secondary (meningoencephalitic) syphilis, the course is too rapid for general paresis, and the serologic test for syphilis was negative.It is possible to make the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis by detecting the measles virus genome.[3,4](#core-r003) This molecular approach can be conclusive when the case has a very unusual course or there are no pathognomonic signs, such as periodic slow-wave complexes on electroencephalographic examination or measles antibody titers, which are the essential laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.The electroencephalogram in this case showed no periodic slow-wave complexes,[5](#core-r005) only the diffuse slowing expected in cases of widespread white-matter disease. This negative finding is correlated with the absence of periodic myoclonic spasms, the hallmark of stage 2 subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, and suggests the absence of brain-stem involvement in this patient. The electroencephalogram was obtained with the patient awake. The periodic slow-wave complexes of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis first appear during sleep, when they are not accompanied by myoclonic spasms. Often, however, the typical periodic electroencephalographic pattern can be brought out when the patient is awake, if diazepam is administered intravenously during the routine electroencephalographic recording.The lesions seen in the imaging studies of this patient do not resemble those of multiple sclerosis, hypertensive vasculopathies, vasculitis, or any of the genetic leukodystrophies, although the occipital lesions somewhat resemble those of mitochondrial encephalopathy. May we see the radiologic images?Dr. James D. Rabinov: A CT scan of the head shows enlargement of the ventricles and sulci and diffuse hypodensities in the white matter of the frontal lobes, the corona radiata, and the centrum semiovale, but most prominently in the occipital lobes, where they also appear to involve the gray matter. There is no evidence of hemorrhage.The MRI studies show confluent abnormalities in both cerebral hemispheres, with the most severe changes in the occipital lobes, where there is extensive hyperintensity in the white matter on T2-weighted images, with tissue loss and cortical thinning ([Figure 1](#f01) and [Figure 2](#f02)). In a scan obtained after the administration of gadolinium, subcortical areas of enhancement are evident in the left occipital lobe, the left posterior parietal lobe, and the right frontal lobe ([Figure 3](#f03)).Dr. Gascon: The MRI studies rule out a number of disorders but not subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The most important finding is evidence of the involvement of gray matter as well as white matter, indicating a panencephalitis.Brismar et al.[6](#core-r006) have developed a radiologic staging scheme for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis that reflects the degree of white-matter changes and atrophy ([Table 3](#t03)). However, the radiologic staging of this disease is not always correlated with its clinical manifestations. MRI is useful for following the course of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis but not for diagnosing the disorder.Examination of the brain-biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis of panencephalitis. The finding of neurofibrillary tangles in cortical neurons is very unusual in a 34-year-old woman but has been reported in young patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.[7](#core-r007) In such patients, neurofibrillary tangles are unaccompanied by senile plaques, vascular amyloidosis, or the granulovacuolar changes of Alzheimer's disease.Although the biopsy findings support the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, it was probably confirmed by an assay for measles antibody. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is associated with a worse prognosis in adults than in children. In patients of all ages, combined treatment[8](#core-r008) with orally administered inosiplex and intraventricular interferon alfa-2b has had the best short-term results. An international multicenter study [9](#core-r009) is now under way to confirm the efficacy of this treatment and elucidate the pathogenesis of the disorder.[10\u201312](#core-r010) Lifelong treatment is probably necessary.Dr. John W. Henson: We ordered a test of the cerebrospinal fluid for viral antibodies after examination of the biopsy specimen showed neurofibrillary tangles.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Matthew P. Frosch: Neurofibrillary tangles are found in many diseases but when combined with encephalitis in a patient of this age, without evidence of other risk factors, they are most consistent with the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The diagnosis was confirmed by examination of serum and cerebrospinal fluid for antibodies against measles virus and other viruses ([Table 4](#t04)).This neurologic disorder associated with persistent measles virus infection of the nervous system was initially described by Dawson,[13](#core-r013) who suggested that it might be caused by a viral infection on the basis of cellular inclusions seen in neurons and glia. Subsequent studies have shown that these nuclear inclusions correspond to viral particles and contain viral antigens.[14](#core-r014) Viral infection of oligodendrocytes may be responsible for the demyelination often found in cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.[15](#core-r015) Inclusions were not found in the small amount of biopsy material examined in this case, but they can be unevenly distributed in the nervous system at early stages of the disease and even at autopsy. In addition to neurofibrillary tangles within neurons, as seen in this case, similar tangles have been identified within oligodendrocytes.[16](#core-r016) In situ hybridization methods have shown that cells containing tangles often contain the viral genome, suggesting that viral infection causes the formation of tangles.[7](#core-r007) Studies of the inflammatory-cell infiltrate in brain tissue from patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis have shown that the perivascular cells are predominantly CD4+ T cells, with B cells seen more frequently in the parenchymal inflammatory infiltrate.[17](#core-r017)Measles infection before two years of age is associated with a risk of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis that is 16 times as high as the risk associated with infection after five years of age.[18](#core-r018) Since the incubation period is typically less than a decade, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is commonly a disease of childhood.[19](#core-r019) The estimated prevalence of the natural disease ranges from 1 to 5 cases per million in the general population, as compared with 1 to 10 per 100,000 in persons infected by the measles virus.[20](#core-r020) Most studies show a male:female ratio of nearly 3:1 for this complication of measles, although measles itself shows no such disparity.[18](#core-r018) Since the introduction of measles vaccination, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis has largely been seen in developing countries. Measles vaccine has not been associated with an increased risk of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. When the disease occurs in vaccinated persons, it is thought to result from a subclinical measles infection that occurred before the age of one year, when immunization is usually begun.[20,21](#core-r020)Approximately 50 cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis have been reported in persons over 18 years of age. The disease apparently has a more aggressive course in adults [22](#core-r022) and may progress more rapidly in pregnant women.[22,23](#core-r022) In several reported cases, the disease was associated with the death of the child in utero or in the immediate peripartum period, but there is no evidence of transmission from mother to fetus.[23](#core-r023) Cortical blindness has been reported as a presenting symptom of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.[24](#core-r024)Measles virus is thought to reach the brain through infection of cerebral endothelial cells,[25](#core-r025) perhaps during the acute exanthem of measles,[26](#core-r026) when other endothelial cells are infected.[19](#core-r019) Access by circulating inflammatory cells is also possible.[27](#core-r027) The measles virus receptor is CD46,[28](#core-r028) a complement-regulating protein with isoforms present on neurons.[29](#core-r029) There is evidence that persistent measles virus infection can be found throughout the body in patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.[30](#core-r030)Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is not a reactivation of productive measles virus infection but a persistent and variably defective infection. The factors that allow the infection to persist are unclear but may include immunologic factors.[31](#core-r031) In tissue culture, the addition of antibodies against measles virus alters the pattern of viral gene expression.[32](#core-r032) This observation may explain why measles infection at a very early age, when maternal antibodies are still present, carries an increased risk of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.The measles virus is a negative-sense, enveloped RNA virus that can infect only humans and other primates. Its envelope carries projections of the H (hemagglutinin) and F (fusion) proteins. The M (matrix) protein sits within the envelope membrane and can interact with the cytoplasmic domains of H and F proteins. In general, although measles virus antigens and genome are present in the brain in patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, infectious viral particles cannot be recovered.[33](#core-r033) Measles virus isolated from specimens of the brains of such patients may interfere with the replication of wild-type measles virus [34](#core-r034) and may have a clonal origin.[35](#core-r035) Numerous alterations in M protein have been described in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,[36\u201338](#core-r036) but changes in the H and F proteins can be associated with persistent infection, with the M protein remaining relatively unaffected.[39,40](#core-r039) Since all three proteins are associated with viral budding from infected cells and the putative fusion with uninfected cells, the persistent nature of the infection is thought to be related to the disruption of these two processes.Dr. E. Tessa Hedley-Whyte: Dr. Werner performed the serologic studies at the Massachusetts State Laboratory.Dr. Barbara Werner: In subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, the characteristic ratio of the cerebrospinal fluid titer to the serum titer is about 1:5, which is consistent with the findings in this case. This ratio is extremely low as compared with the normal ratio (1:200 to 1:500). It is interesting that the patient came from outside this country, where vaccination is less widespread.Dr. Henson: After the diagnosis was established, an Ommaya reservoir was inserted into the right lateral ventricle, and twice-weekly injections of interferon alfa-2b were administered at a dose of 1.0 million units per square meter of body-surface area. Two and a half months after the initiation of therapy, follow-up studies, including serologic studies, MRI scanning, electroencephalography, and neuropsychological testing indicated stabilization of the disease. Therapy was subsequently discontinued because liver-enzyme levels tripled. Two weeks after the discontinuation of therapy, myoclonus and complete cortical blindness developed. When the results of liver-function tests returned to normal, we resumed the infusion of interferon alfa-2b, with slight improvement, but the cortical blindness persisted.Dr. Gascon: During treatment, not only liver function but also uric acid levels should be monitored, because inosiplex can cause hyperuricemia and renal stones. The most important factor in the outcome, however, is the stage of the disease at which treatment is started. At stage 1 or 2, not just stabilization but a regression of symptoms may sometimes be achieved, whereas at stage 3, the results are much less certain. An international study that has just begun includes only patients at stage 1 or 2. The experience with these patients has been encouraging, although relapse is usually a long-term problem even with good initial results. The international study compares inosiplex alone with inosiplex in combination with interferon alfa-2b. Patients with no response to either treatment can be given therapies that have been anecdotally reported in the literature.\n",

      "question": "A 19-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient gastroenterology division because of painless rectal bleeding.\nThe patient had been well until 8 months earlier, when a diagnosis of papillary carcinoma was made on examination of a biopsy specimen of a thyroid nodule obtained by fine-needle aspiration. A total thyroidectomy was performed, and pathological examination of the specimen disclosed a papillary thyroid carcinoma, cribriform\u2013morular variant, with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Staging studies revealed no evidence of distant metastases. The patient was treated with a single, intravenously administered dose of radioactive iodine (iodine-131, 75 mCi), and follow-up studies showed no abnormalities.\nAt the time of admission for surgery, a complete blood count revealed a hematocrit of 32.7%; the hemoglobin level was 10.6 g per deciliter, and the mean corpuscular volume 82 \u03bcm\n3\n. Six weeks later, a repeated study revealed similar values; the serum iron level was 26 \u03bcg per deciliter (5 \u03bcmol per liter), iron-binding capacity 336 \u03bcg per deciliter (60 \u03bcmol per liter), and ferritin level 5 ng per milliliter. Iron supplements were prescribed, but the patient stopped taking them after 2 months because they caused abdominal cramping. Two weeks before the gastrointestinal evaluation, the serum iron level was 20 \u03bcg per deciliter (4 \u03bcmol per liter), and the ferritin level was 6 ng per milliliter. Two of three stool specimens were positive for occult blood. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital.\nThe patient recalled having seen dark-red, bloody streaks on the outside of formed stools on at least three occasions. She did not have fatigue, abdominal pain, a change in bowel habits, pain with defecation, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or weight loss. She was in her senior year of high school. She did not use tobacco products, illicit drugs, or alcohol. Her medications included levothyroxine and a calcium supplement. There was no history of head or neck irradiation or exposure to toxins. A paternal grandfather had a goiter. Three maternal great aunts had cancer: one had colon cancer, one breast cancer, and one lung cancer. Her maternal great-grandmother and paternal grandmother both had lung cancer. Her parents and two sisters were well. Colonoscopy performed in her mother 5 years earlier had shown no abnormalities; her father had not undergone colonoscopy.\nThe patient's height was 167 cm, and her weight was 61 kg. The blood pressure was 115/54 mm Hg, and the pulse 73 beats per minute. There were no cutaneous lesions. The chest was clear on auscultation, and the heart sounds were normal. A grade 2 systolic ejection murmur was heard at the left sternal border. The abdomen was soft, without rebound tenderness or guarding; there were no masses or organomegaly. The musculoskeletal and neurologic examinations showed no abnormalities.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Chung:* This 19-year-old woman presented with a history of thyroid cancer, iron-deficiency anemia, and intermittent painless rectal bleeding. Although I am aware of the diagnosis in this case, it provides an opportunity to discuss the differential diagnosis of rectal bleeding in young adults, an age group in which this symptom is uncommon.\n### Non-Neoplastic Disorders\n\nInflammatory and infectious colitides that compromise the epithelium can result in hemorrhage. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are almost always associated with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constitutional symptoms such as growth failure in children, none of which were present in this case. Similarly, colitis due to an enterohemorrhagic organism such as *Escherichia coli,* salmonella, shigella, or campylobacter is typically a self-limited, acute illness associated with diarrhea. Ischemic colitis is not seen in this patient's age group.Meckel's diverticulum, a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, can cause bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract in children. Most children with a Meckel's diverticulum are asymptomatic, but complications, including hemorrhage and obstruction, occur in up to 16% of cases.[1](#core-r001) However, such cases are typically seen in boys who are 3 years of age or younger.In adults, vascular abnormalities such as hemorrhoids, angioectasias, and arteriovenous malformations are important causes of painless rectal bleeding. Although both hemorrhoids and vascular ectasia are uncommon in adolescents and young adults, hemorrhage can result from multiple gastrointestinal telangiectasias occurring as part of the hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome. In this case, no physical signs or symptoms, such as recurrent epistaxis or telangiectasis on the lips or fingers, suggest this diagnosis.Another important cause of painless rectal bleeding is diverticular disease, but this disease is very unusual in adolescents and young adults. Furthermore, it is characterized by large-volume acute hemorrhage, not intermittent streaking of blood. The solitary rectal ulcer syndrome can result in rectal bleeding; although this diagnosis is more common in older adults, cases have been described in young adults and teenagers.[2](#core-r002) However, it is accompanied by painful defecation, constipation, and passage of mucus. This patient had none of these symptoms.\n### Neoplasms\n\nBenign and malignant neoplasms warrant consideration; these include juvenile polyps, adenomatous polyps, and colorectal cancer. Juvenile polyps, which are benign, usually solitary hamartomatous lesions located in the rectum, are the most common type of colonic polyp in childhood and are identified in as many as 2% of adolescents.[3](#core-r003) They can result in rectal bleeding and anemia and can be part of the juvenile polyposis syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract and typically diagnosed in the teenage years. Although there are no consistent extracolonic manifestations, some patients also have hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.[4](#core-r004) Sporadic adenomatous polyps are extremely unusual in children, but the familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease characterized by hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps, often develops in the teenage years. There are also case reports of colon cancer in teenagers presenting with painless bleeding, although it is uncommon in this age group and is not a leading consideration in the patient under discussion. An important clue to the diagnosis in this 19-year-old woman with iron-deficiency anemia and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding is the presence of thyroid cancer.\n### Thyroid Cancer\n\nApproximately 24,000 cases of thyroid cancer will be diagnosed in the United States this year, and the majority will be papillary carcinoma.[5](#core-r005) Most thyroid cancers occur in women, with a female:male ratio of 2.5:1. Thyroid cancer is typically diagnosed in the fourth or fifth decade of life. Because this patient was so young when the diagnosis was made, the question arises whether she has a risk factor for thyroid cancer. Exposure to ionizing radiation in childhood can increase the risk of thyroid cancer by a factor of 18,[6](#core-r006) but there is no such history in this case.The early age at which thyroid cancer was diagnosed in this patient suggests a hereditary thyroid cancer syndrome. The best characterized of these syndromes is the autosomal dominant multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN-2) syndrome, which results from germline mutations in the *RET* oncogene. There are several variants of MEN-2, but all are associated with a nearly 100% risk of the development of medullary thyroid cancer. As a consequence, prophylactic thyroidectomy in childhood is routinely performed. The histologic finding of papillary rather than medullary carcinoma in this case rules out MEN-2.Two additional familial cancer syndromes are associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Cowden's disease is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by a high prevalence of breast, thyroid, uterine, and brain tumors. Patients may have multiple small hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, but in general, they are clinically silent and not considered to be precancerous. The lifetime risk of thyroid cancer in patients with the familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome is 1 to 2%.[7,8](#core-r007) When thyroid cancer develops in patients with this syndrome, the tumors are usually papillary, although in some cases they are follicular. Ninety percent of cases occur in women, and the mean age at the time of diagnosis is 28 years. In a third of these cases, the diagnosis of thyroid cancer precedes the diagnosis of colonic polyposis.\n### Summary\n\nIn this patient with painless rectal bleeding, a sporadic juvenile polyp is one of the leading diagnostic considerations. However, the history of thyroid cancer makes it more likely that she has a genetic susceptibility to cancer. Both Cowden's disease and familial adenomatous polyposis are associated with multiple colonic polyps and thyroid cancer, but the small hamartomas in Cowden's disease rarely result in clinically significant hemorrhage. Thus, familial adenomatous polyposis emerges as the most likely diagnosis. The absence of a family history of this disease is unusual but is not inconsistent with the diagnosis. Approximately 20% of all cases of familial adenomatous polyposis have no apparent hereditary basis.The diagnosis can be confirmed by a colonoscopic examination, which was the diagnostic procedure in this case.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. William C. Faquin:* A fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed to evaluate a nodule in the patient's left thyroid lobe. Microscopical examination of the aspirate revealed cohesive groups of epithelial cells in a branching network, with a papillary and focally solid architectural pattern ([Figure 1A](#f01)). A diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma was made on the basis of the cytologic features, which included cells that had enlarged, pale nuclei with extensive longitudinal nuclear grooves ([Figure 1B](#f01)).The thyroidectomy specimen weighed 18 g and had multiple, small, well-circumscribed nodules ranging in diameter from 0.1 to 0.6 cm in both lobes. Histologic examination of the nodules revealed a solid architectural pattern of follicular cells as well as focal areas with cribriform spaces ([Figure 1C and 1D](#f01)). The cribriform spaces were formed by thin bridges, two cells thick, of cuboidal epithelial cells, with little intervening fibrovascular stroma. Focally, some of the solid areas contained squamous morulae formed by cohesive collections of elongated epithelial cells ([Figure 1E](#f01)). The nuclei of the epithelial cells were enlarged, oval, and grooved. Other thyroid nodules had histologic features of conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma. A diagnosis of multifocal, bilateral papillary thyroid carcinoma, cribriform\u2013morular variant, was made.The cribriform\u2013morular variant is a rare subtype of papillary thyroid carcinoma, accounting for approximately 0.16% of cases.[9\u201311](#core-r009) This tumor is diagnosed much more frequently in women than in men (by a factor of 8 to 17), and at the time of diagnosis, most patients are less than 30 years old.[9,11,12](#core-r009) It can occur as either a single nodule or as multiple nodules that have a characteristic cribriform pattern with associated solid, morular, and spindled areas. Occasionally, microscopical features of conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma are also present.The overall prognosis is the same for the cribriform\u2013morular variant of thyroid carcinoma and conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma, with less than 10% of cases characterized as clinically aggressive.[11,13](#core-r011) Approximately one fourth to one third of cases of the cribriform\u2013morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis, and among patients with that syndrome who have synchronous thyroid cancer, up to 92% have histologic features of the cribriform\u2013morular variant.[9](#core-r009) Therefore, any patient presenting with this variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma should be evaluated for familial adenomatous polyposis.Although sporadic forms of the cribriform\u2013morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma may be manifested as a solitary nodule, cases associated with familial adenomatous polyposis are more often multifocal.[9,12](#core-r009) Most such cases that have been studied exhibit *RET/PTC* gene rearrangements, as do many conventional cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma, rather than biallelic inactivation of the *APC* gene.[14\u201316](#core-r014) This suggests that germ-line mutations of the *APC* gene may confer a genetic susceptibility to the development of the cribriform\u2013morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma, but other, additional genetic alterations are probably required for tumorigenesis.In this case, colonoscopy showed innumerable pedunculated polyps throughout the colon, ranging from 4 to 20 mm in diameter. Biopsy specimens from the hepatic flexure and the transverse and sigmoid colon showed pedunculated polyps composed of branching tubules of epithelial cells embedded within the lamina propria ([Figure 2A](#f02)), with low-grade dysplastic changes in the epithelial cells ([Figure 2B](#f02)) \u2014 findings that are diagnostic of tubular adenomas. The combination of these clinical and pathological features is diagnostic of familial adenomatous polyposis.\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Michael M. Maher:* After the colonoscopy, double-contrast barium studies of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract were performed. A double-contrast view of the stomach shows multiple polypoid filling defects in the fundus ([Figure 3A](#f03)). These filling defects represent multiple polyps of similar size. Multiple polyps were also present in the body and antrum of the stomach. The small-bowel series shows no polyps, suggesting that the process has spared the small bowel.Double-contrast views of the colon show the presence of multiple polyps extending from the anus to the right colon; no part of the colon or rectum is spared. The number of polyps is greater in the rectum and the distal colon than in more proximal areas ([Figure 3B and 3C](#f03)).\n### Familial Adenomatous Polyposis: General Features and Clinical Management\n\n*Dr. Chung:* The care of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis is focused on managing the risk of cancer.[17](#core-r017) Colonic polyps typically appear when such patients are in their early teens, and the average age when colon cancer is diagnosed is 39 years. In the absence of colectomy, this patient has a 100% risk of colon cancer. Extracolonic manifestations of this disease, which are common, include fundic gland polyps, duodenal adenomas, epidermoid cysts, osteomas, desmoid tumors, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium, and thyroid cancer. In addition to thyroid cancer, the patient probably has fundic gland polyps. Ampullary and duodenal tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.Screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy for colonic polyps and cancer is recommended annually for all family members starting at the age of 12 years. If the results are consistently normal, the screening program can be stopped at the age of 40 years.Prophylactic colectomy is usually necessary once diffuse polyposis has been documented. A total colectomy is preferred; however, in some cases a subtotal colectomy is a reasonable choice. After subtotal colectomy, endoscopic surveillance of the residual rectum should be performed every 6 months. In this patient, a total proctocolectomy with construction of an ileoanal pouch was performed 3 weeks after colonoscopy. Because of the risk of recurrence of adenomas in the distal ileum and rectal cuff, the patient will undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy.*Dr. Faquin:* Gross examination of the colectomy specimen revealed the presence of more than 600 sessile and pedunculated polyps throughout the colonic and rectal mucosa, extending to and involving the ileocecal valve ([Figure 2C](#f02)). Microscopical examination of the polyps showed the characteristic features of tubular adenomas, with most of the polyps characterized by low-grade dysplasia. Although focal high-grade dysplasia was seen ([Figure 2D](#f02)), carcinoma was not identified.*Dr. Chung:* This patient will require lifelong surveillance for cancers that may arise in extracolonic sites. An upper endoscopy, performed every 1 to 3 years, is recommended, with a biopsy of the ampulla, even if it appears normal. Fundic gland polyps have traditionally been thought to have no malignant potential, but there are case reports of gastric adenocarcinoma in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.[18](#core-r018) Annual thyroid examinations are also recommended, and screening for childhood hepatoblastomas with annual liver palpation, ultrasound examination, and tests of serum alpha-fetoprotein should be considered. These guidelines apply not only to known carriers of the mutation but also to at-risk family members whose carrier status remains undefined.In this patient, I performed upper gastrointestinal endoscopy approximately 3 months after the colectomy. There were multiple polyps in the stomach and a single polyp in the duodenum, and the ampulla of Vater looked prominent. Biopsies of the stomach, ampulla, and duodenum were performed.*Dr. Faquin:* Microscopical examination of the biopsy specimen of the ampulla showed features of a tubular adenoma. Most of the polyp contained low-grade dysplasia; however, focal high-grade dysplasia was also present (Figure 1A of the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP355222349DC1), available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org). There was no histologic evidence of intramucosal or invasive carcinoma. Examination of a biopsy specimen of the duodenum also showed a tubular adenoma, and a fundic gland polyp with low-grade dysplasia was present in a biopsy specimen of the stomach (Figure 1B of the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP355222349DC1)).*Dr. Chung:* Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 activity, such as sulindac and celecoxib, have shown some benefit as chemopreventive agents in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and a residual rectum; these drugs have an important adjunctive role in the management of this syndrome. However, these agents may not be effective in preventing the formation of polyps and should not be considered definitive therapy that can replace endoscopic surveillance and carefully timed surgery.[19\u201321](#core-r019) In this patient, treatment with sulindac was started 1 month after the colectomy, but it was discontinued after 3 months because of spontaneous bruising.\n### Genetic Features and Genetic Testing\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis results from germ-line mutations in the *APC* tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 5q21. *APC* was one of the first inherited cancer susceptibility genes to be cloned (in 1991). Approximately 400 germ-line *APC* mutations have been identified, and more than 80% result in a premature stop codon, which leads to a truncated protein that is nonfunctional. The location of the mutation within the *APC* gene may correlate with the severity of the disease.[8,22](#core-r008) A second mutation that inactivates the second allele of the gene is required for the formation of colonic polyps.Genetic testing for *APC* is now standard in the care of families at risk for familial adenomatous polyposis. For all inherited cancer syndromes, the optimal approach is to test an affected family member (the proband) first. If a mutation is identified, then testing will be highly predictive of the risk in asymptomatic relatives. In less than 20% of cases of familial adenomatous polyposis in which clinical features are present, no mutation is identified in the proband and genetic testing is uninformative. In these cases, the absence of a mutation does not rule out the development of familial adenomatous polyposis in other family members, and intensive surveillance for cancer is required for all family members.At this patient's first visit to the clinic, we discussed genetic testing, and she elected to have blood drawn for the test. A truncating mutation at codon 302 of the *APC* gene was identified, confirming the diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis.We believe that this is a new mutation and that the patient's parents do not have a germ-line mutation in the *APC* gene. However, in rare cases gonadal mosaicism in one parent, with the development of an *APC* mutation in only the oocytes or spermatocytes, results in affected offspring. For this reason, the patient's siblings elected to undergo genetic testing; they did not have the *APC* mutation. The patient can pass this mutation on to any children she may have in the future, and she may therefore consider preimplantation genetic diagnosis.It has been 3 years since the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma was made, and the patient has completed her sophomore year of college. She has not had any recurrence of thyroid cancer. The ampullary adenoma was removed by endoscopic ampullectomy. Annual endoscopic examinations have shown several small adenomas in the residual rectal mucosa, with no recurrence of duodenal or ampullary adenomas. Iron-deficiency anemia has persisted, despite oral iron supplementation. Evaluation by a hematologist did not reveal a specific cause of this deficiency.There are some important lessons to be learned from this case. First, the diagnosis of cancer in a patient at an unusually young age should always prompt consideration of a genetic syndrome, even if there is no family history. Second, a hereditary colon cancer syndrome can be associated initially with an extracolonic tumor; in familial adenomatous polyposis, the spectrum of extracolonic tumors includes thyroid tumors, gastric polyps, and duodenal ampullary tumors. Finally, genetic testing is a valuable tool in the management and diagnosis of familial cancer syndromes.*A Physician:* How do we manage the gastric lesions in such patients?*Dr. Chung:* The risk of gastric cancer in patients with fundic gland polyps is very low. However, there are case reports of gastric cancer developing in some families with this disease, so upper endoscopic examination is performed every 1 to 3 years.*A Physician:* This diagnosis can be overwhelming for a healthy young person. Is psychiatric care begun in preparation for these major changes?*Dr. Chung:* The psychological impact can be tremendous, and we address these issues as part of the genetic-counseling process. Genetic counselors devote much of their time to helping both the patients and their families understand all the implications of this diagnosis. It is important to emphasize that early recognition of this syndrome can alter the natural history of the disease, aiding in the prevention or early detection of cancer.*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): How good is the bowel control after this surgery?*Dr. Chung:* In general, bowel control is excellent. After an initial readjustment during the postoperative period, most patients have approximately 5 bowel movements per day, with very rare incontinence.\n",

      "question": "A 23-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia.\nThe patient was apparently in excellent health until about one week earlier, when a dry cough developed, with a rise in the temperature to 38.9 \u00b0C and chilliness. A physician prescribed a cough preparation, without improvement. During the next few days diffuse arthralgias and myalgias appeared, with increasing fatigue. Two days before entry the patient became dyspneic, with pleuritic left-sided chest pain, and coughed up scanty amounts of blood.\nOn the same day the patient was admitted to another hospital, where physical examination showed that the temperature was 39.2 \u00b0C, the pulse was 116, the respirations were 18, and the blood pressure was 115/80 mm Hg. Rhonchi were heard in both lungs; a gallop rhythm was audible on cardiac auscultation. The oxygen saturation, measured while the patient was breathing room air, was 85 percent and rose to 91 percent when oxygen was administered at a rate of 4 liters per minute. Radiographs of the chest were reported to show a reticulonodular pattern and a heart of normal size. Cefuroxime and erythromycin were begun by vein. The patient's hypoxemia worsened progressively, and an orotracheal tube was inserted, with the provision of ventilatory support and supplemental oxygen; pancuronium bromide and morphine sulfate were injected. Thin, pink secretions issued from the orotracheal tube. The patient was transferred to this hospital.\nThe patient was a student. There was no history of previous chest pain, heart murmur, use of alcohol or tobacco, exposure to animals, use of illicit drugs, sexual promiscuity, homosexuality, receipt of blood products, recent travel, or exposure to toxic chemicals.\nThe temperature was 38.2 \u00b0C, the pulse was 125, and the respirations were controlled at a rate of 10 per minute. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg.\nOn physical examination the patient was a thin but well-developed young man who was sedated and paralyzed. No rash, splinter hemorrhages, Roth spots, or lymphadenopathy was found. The head and neck were normal; the jugular venous pressure was 9 to 10 cm of water. Diffuse crackles were present throughout both lungs. The heart rhythm was regular; a short grade 3 systolic murmur and a loud S\n3\ngallop were audible at the cardiac apex; no diastolic murmur or pericardial friction rub was heard. The abdomen was normal. The extremities were warm, the peripheral pulses were intact, and no digital clubbing, cyanosis, or edema was found.\nThe urine was normal; the sediment contained a few crystals per high-power field and no red or white cells. The hematologic and blood chemical findings are presented in\nTable 1\nand\nTable 2\n, respectively. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 132, with an R-wave axis of +14 degrees and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. A radiograph of the chest obtained by portable technique revealed that the endotracheal tube terminated 3 cm above the tracheal carina; the heart appeared normal; there was dense perihilar consolidation of both lungs, with relative sparing of the apexes and to a lesser extent the bases; the consolidation had increased in comparison with that shown on the films from the referring hospital; a small left pleural effusion was evident. The results of arterial-blood gas measurements are presented in\nTable 3\n. Microscopical examination of a stained specimen of sputum showed no neutrophils, a few red cells, and no microorganisms.\nSpecimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and a urine specimen was sent for testing for legionella urinary antigen. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, and cimetidine were administered by vein. During the next few hours the blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg systolic; dopamine and norepinephrine were begun by intravenous infusion. The findings on cardiac catheterization are presented in\nTable 4\n. An x-ray film of the chest disclosed that the endotracheal tube, a right internal jugular pulmonary arterial line, and a nasogastric tube terminated in appropriate locations; the heart size remained normal; there was slight clearing of the bilateral air-space disease. The systolic blood pressure became stable in the vicinity of 95 to 100 mm Hg. Gentamicin, vancomycin, and methylprednisolone were added by vein. The temperature rose to 38.7 \u00b0C and later subsided to 37.9 \u00b0C. The arterial-blood oxygen levels are shown in\nTable 3\n.\nAt 1 a.m. on the second hospital day a transthoracic echocardiographic examination, performed with portable technique, showed slight dilatation of the left atrium; there was a large mass of echoes in the left atrium that prolapsed into the left ventricle during diastole; the site of attachment of the mass was indeterminate; the size and systolic function of the left ventricle were normal; the aortic and tricuspid valves appeared normal; small anterior and posterior pericardial effusions were noted. At 6 a.m. the temperature was 37.1 \u00b0C. The blood pressure was 105/55 mm Hg. The cardiac-catheterization findings are presented in\nTable 4\n. Later in the morning, cultures of all specimens obtained at this hospital and the referring hospital were reported to be negative.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. John J. Reilly, Jr.[\\*](#FN1): May we review the x-ray films and the echocardiographic study?Dr. Robert E. Dinsmore: A film of the chest obtained at the other hospital shows a normal appearance of the heart. There is no evidence of pleural fluid. Bilateral patchy areas of increased density with a nodular component are evident in the mid-lungs, with a tendency to spare the apexes and bases. There are also linear shadows, some with the appearance of thickened interlobular septa. The examination on admission to this hospital shows a considerable increase in the density of the bilateral air-space disease, with a perihilar mid-lung pattern. The heart is still normal in size, and a small amount of pleural fluid is visible at the left base. A film obtained several hours later demonstrates some clearing of the bilateral air-space disease. The heart size remained normal.Dr. Stefan Mark Nidorf: The echocardiograms reveal a dense, homogeneous mass in the left atrium prolapsing into the left ventricle, which is of normal size.Dr. Reilly: Was there any evidence of a mass in the right atrium?Dr. Nidorf: The patient was undergoing ventilation, and the presence or absence of a right atrial mass could not be determined.Dr. Reilly: Was there any evidence of an atrial or ventricular septal defect?Dr. Nidorf: Those possibilities could not be excluded, but the right-sided chambers were not dilated.Dr. Reilly: This patient was a previously healthy young man in whom a life-threatening illness developed over a period of one week. His initial presenting manifestations of hemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain were suggestive of pulmonary infarction, and then profound hypoxemia occurred, with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. He had mild anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, an extremely elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and severe hypoalbuminemia. Laboratory testing demonstrated normal hepatic and renal function. There was no evidence of coagulopathy. The respiratory failure worsened, requiring mechanical support, and hemodynamic measurements performed after the development of hypotension showed pulmonary hypertension and a markedly elevated pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure in the presence of a good cardiac output and a persistently normal cardiac silhouette on x-ray films of the chest. These findings suggest the presence of either a left-to-right shunt or an impediment to filling of the left ventricle, as might be seen in disorders affecting the pulmonary venous bed or mitral valve. Echocardiographic examination, performed at the bedside on an urgent basis, demonstrated a large mass of echoes in the left atrium that prolapsed into the left ventricle during diastole; there were no signs of an intracardiac shunt. All cultures were negative.I suspect that the diagnostic procedure was a thoracotomy with excision of the left atrial mass. Although scanning with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been reported to be useful in the evaluation of cardiac masses, the severity of this patient's illness and the fact that surgical therapy would almost certainly be required regardless of the radiographic findings dictated proceeding directly to a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic procedure[1,2](#core-r001).Although the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in a young, presumably immunocompetent host is broad, several features of this case narrow the spectrum considerably. Possible causes for his initial presentation with fever, cough, and subsequent hemoptysis and pleuritic pain include pneumonic processes involving the left lung in a subpleural location and causing pleuritic pain. Also possible is pulmonary infarction, which is usually the result of pulmonary thromboembolic disease. This previously healthy young man had no known factors predisposing him to deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. The physical examination did not suggest deep venous thrombosis, although many patients with pulmonary emboli lack such evidence on presentation. Subsequent developments in this case make pneumonia and pulmonary thromboembolic disease unlikely, since neither should result in an echogenic mass in the left atrium.In view of the echocardiographic findings, the differential diagnosis in this case centers on intraatrial masses, which can be benign tumors, primary or metastatic malignant tumors, vegetations, or thrombi[3](#core-r003). The setting in this case would be unusual for a left atrial thrombus. Factors predisposing patients to its development include atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction. There is little evidence to support a diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarct. The electrocardiographic pattern did not suggest ischemia, there was no enzymatic evidence of damage to the heart although the lactate dehydrogenase level was slightly elevated, and the echocardiographic study demonstrated vigorous contraction of the left ventricle without regional-wall motion abnormalities. Although it is possible that the patient had antecedent atrial fibrillation, there is no information in the case record to suggest it, and thrombus alone would not explain the prominent constitutional symptoms and the possible pulmonary infarction.The possibility that the echogenic mass was an infectious vegetation deserves consideration. The site of attachment of the mass was not clearly visualized, and it may have been attached to a leaflet of the mitral valve. The diagnosis of mitral-valve endocarditis is consistent with the systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation caused by deformity or destruction of the valve or by interference with valvular closure as the prolapsed mass reentered the atrium during systole. The fever, arthralgia, elevated sedimentation rate, and anemia are also consistent with that diagnosis. Positive blood cultures for a bacterial pathogen would support the diagnosis of endocarditis, but in 5 percent of the cases cultures are persistently negative. In that circumstance one must always consider causative organisms that typically result in negative blood cultures, such as rickettsia. Q fever has been reported to cause endocarditis with negative blood cultures,[4](#core-r004) but in the absence of a history of exposure to livestock or travel to an area where the disorder is endemic, this diagnosis seems unlikely. Also possible is a nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, characterized by sterile vegetations[5](#core-r005). This disorder typically occurs in patients with a malignant tumor or a chronic debilitating disease and is thought to be associated with a hypercoagulable state. It is unusual (2.7 percent of 770 cases)[5](#core-r005) in patients in this age range, as is a mass of the size described in this case. In addition, the presence of left-sided vegetations would not account for this patient's pleuritic pain and hemoptysis.A vegetation of the size of the mass seen in this case has been described in a patient with Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis,[6](#core-r006) and left atrial vegetations, as opposed to mitral-valve vegetations, have also been reported[7](#core-r007). Fungal endocarditis can also cause large vegetations. In the absence of an underlying malignant tumor or an immunodeficiency state and with no history of intravenous drug abuse, insertion of central venous lines, or other instrumentation and no history of valvular heart disease, endocarditis with persistently negative blood cultures and such a large vegetation seems unlikely.Tumors causing an intracavitary myocardial mass are secondary 20 to 40 times as often as primary. Of the primary tumors involving the heart, 75 percent are benign and 25 percent are malignant[8](#core-r008). The presentation of primary cardiac tumors, which are found at autopsy in only 0.0017 to 0.28 percent of the cases,[2](#core-r002) depends on their location and, to a lesser extent, the tumor type.Benign tumors of the heart include myxoma (30.5 percent), lipoma (10.5 percent), papillary fibroelastoma (9.9 percent), rhabdomyoma (8.5 percent),[8](#core-r008) and rarely fibroma, hemangioma, teratoma, mesothelioma of the atrioventricular node, granular-cell tumor, neurofibroma, and lymphangioma. Malignant primary cardiac tumors are predominantly sarcomas and include angiosarcoma (9.2 percent), rhabdomyosarcoma (6.1 percent), fibrosarcoma (3.3 percent), and a variety of rare tumors[8](#core-r008). Primary malignant lymphoma accounts for 1.7 percent of primary cardiac tumors.The symptoms associated with tumors of the left atrium are constitutional or result from embolic phenomena and hemodynamic effects[2,9\u201312](#core-r002). The systemic symptoms, which are most notable in patients with myxomas, include fever (50 percent), weight loss (25 percent), and Raynaud's phenomenon[12](#core-r012). A third of the patients have an elevated sedimentation rate, and a third have anemia; a variety of other laboratory abnormalities have been described, including elevated immunoglobulin levels, both thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis, and erythrocytosis. Embolic events are common with left atrial tumors, particularly with myxomas. When tumors are right-sided they can be manifested by pulmonary emboli, which occur in 25 percent of patients with a myxoma, or paradoxical systemic emboli. Emboli from left atrial lesions can spread to all parts of the systemic circulation, and the diagnosis of myxoma by identifying emboli in the skin or elsewhere in the peripheral vasculature has been reported. Pulmonary emboli can occur in the presence of a left-to-right shunt, which is usually intracardiac. Left atrial masses can present with hemodynamic effects and a clinical picture that mimics mitral-valve disease. Thus, 70 percent of patients with a myxoma have evidence of pulmonary hypertension on presentation, 70 percent have a \u201cmitral\u201d diastolic murmur, 50 percent have a \u201cmitral\u201d systolic murmur, and a third have an additional sound heard after the second heart sound[12](#core-r012). Often referred to as a \u201ctumor plop,\u201d this sound is thought to result from the abrupt collision of the tumor with the endocardial wall or its abrupt deceleration at the end of this excursion during diastole. The sound occurs somewhat later than the opening snap but earlier than S3 and is often confused with either of those sounds.Many features of the case under discussion are consistent with the diagnosis of a left atrial tumor. This patient had hemoptysis, which is seen in 15 percent of patients with a myxoma, and he had pulmonary hypertension and systemic hypotension, although without evidence of total mitral-valve occlusion. His short apical systolic murmur may have been due to mitral regurgitation as the mass moved back into the left atrium, and his loud S3 gallop may have been the \u201ctumor plop\u201d that I discussed. The physical findings vary according to clinical reports, and the patient's position can influence both the physical findings and the symptoms. The apparent absence of a systolic murmur on presentation at the other hospital, despite a grade 3 apical systolic murmur on admission to this hospital, could reflect interobserver variability but might also be interpreted as evidence of a variable systolic murmur. There is no mention of a positional component of this patient's symptoms. The perihilar consolidations demonstrated on the x-ray films of the chest may have been a manifestation of transudation of fluid in the setting of an elevated pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure of 30 mm Hg and hypoproteinemia.Although many features of this case can be explained by a cardiac tumor, several points deserve further discussion. Among the patient's initial symptoms were left-sided pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis, which suggest pulmonary embolism or infarction. One possibility is an embolus from the left atrium traveling across a left-to-right shunt and producing pulmonary vascular occlusion. However, no intracardiac defect was visualized on the echocardiographic study, the sizes of the right-sided chambers were normal, and there is no indication of a step-up in oxygenation during the right-sided cardiac catheterization to support the existence of an intracardiac shunt. In addition, the physical examination revealed no signs of systemic embolism. Taken together, these facts reduce the probability that an embolus from the left atrial mass was responsible for pulmonary vascular occlusion.A second mechanism by which a left atrial mass can produce pulmonary infarction is occlusion of the draining pulmonary veins, which can occur when neoplasms grow from the pulmonary veins into the left atrium, and vice versa. Schiller and Madge[13](#core-r013) reported 15 cases of neoplasms within the pulmonary veins with a prominent intraatrial component on pathological examination. Although in two of these cases the tumors appeared to be primary sarcomas of the pulmonary veins, most of them were bronchogenic carcinomas invading the veins and atria. The authors of several subsequent reports[14](#core-r014) described the same phenomenon in patients with lung cancer and suggested that CT scanning may be helpful in making this diagnosis. Recently, there was a report[15](#core-r015) of a 30-year-old woman who presented with fever, cough, dyspnea, and signs of pulmonary edema, and echocardiographic examination demonstrated an intraatrial mass suggestive of a myxoma; the patient died before its excision, however, and at autopsy was found to have an adenocarcinoma invading the pulmonary veins and growing into the left atrium. That case report is remarkably similar to the case under discussion. In addition, there are reports of primary cardiac tumors, including myxomas and sarcomas, producing pulmonary venous occlusion with resultant pulmonary infarction[16,17](#core-r016). It is therefore possible that this patient had a pulmonary infarct due to this mechanism, which would explain the pleuritic pain, hemoptysis, and subsequent development of a left pleural effusion. It is also possible that pulmonary infarction, with or without superinfection, contributed to the patient's toxic presentation. There is no mention in the case record of whether the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was measured bilaterally, but in the presence of pulmonary venous thrombosis there can be regional differences in the measured wedge pressure. Such a finding would suggest the diagnosis of pulmonary venous disease.A third mechanism causing pulmonary infarction is the rare occurrence of an atrial myxoma involving both the right and left atria[18](#core-r018).Myxomas are the most common benign cardiac tumors. Although the distinction between benign and malignant primary cardiac tumors is difficult to make preoperatively on clinical grounds, several factors suggest the presence of a malignant tumor. They include mediastinal invasion, rapid growth, involvement of the right side of the heart, and a combined intramural and intracavitary mass on presentation[2](#core-r002). Isolated masses of the left atrium are most often myxomas.Several features of atrial myxomas deserve special mention. They have a strong association with prominent constitutional symptoms and cause symptoms suggestive of inflammatory disorders. Examples are syndromes resembling polymyositis and other connective-tissue disorders,[19](#core-r019) clinical and angiographic findings consistent with polyarteritis nodosa,[20](#core-r020) and in one case systemic amyloidosis with an elevated serum AA protein level that fell after excision of the tumor[21](#core-r021). Autoantibodies whose levels diminish after excision of a myxoma have also been reported[22](#core-r022). Finally, myxomas can produce interleukin-6, as evidenced by the observation that the serum levels may become undetectable after resection of the tumor[23](#core-r023). Most reports of left atrial myxomas emphasize the nonspecific nature of the symptoms and note that the presenting syndromes often resemble those of primary mitral-valve disease, endocarditis, primary pulmonary hypertension, connective-tissue disease, or cerebrovascular disease[12](#core-r012). Thus, it is difficult to be entirely confident of the diagnosis before excision of the mass. Myxomas have been reported in patients ranging in age from 3 to 83 years, with a mean age of 56 years. There is a 3:1 female predominance; 90 percent are solitary tumors, and 86 percent involve the left atrium. The usual site of attachment is the fossa ovalis, but other sites have been reported. Approximately 7 percent of patients with a myxoma have either a family history of myxoma or the so-called syndrome myxoma, which can include pigmented cutaneous lesions, primary nodular adrenocortical hyperplasia, myxomatous mammary fibroadenomas, testicular Sertoli-cell tumors, and pituitary adenomas with excessive production of growth hormone[2](#core-r002). The patient under discussion had none of these findings. Further complicating the picture are case reports of atrial myxomas that became infected and presented with bacteremia[24\u201326](#core-r024). In this setting the presenting picture is virtually indistinguishable from that of bacterial endocarditis. This patient lacked the positive blood cultures that would suggest such a diagnosis.The diagnosis of intracardiac tumors almost always requires excision of the tumor mass. Although certain features on imaging studies may suggest a particular tumor type, none are specific enough to warrant a confident diagnosis before a biopsy. Echocardiographic study, particularly two-dimensional echocardiographic study, is the initial diagnostic procedure of choice. It often provides sufficient information concerning tumor size, site, and attachment to allow one to proceed to excision without further diagnostic testing[2](#core-r002). Recent reports have suggested that transesophageal echocardiographic examination may allow better visualization of the atria and atrial septa in confusing cases such as this one[2](#core-r002). The diagnosis in cases in which no definitive site of attachment is found is uncertain, with no uniform agreement whether the patient has an intracavitary thrombus or a myxoma[27](#core-r027). Similarly, some observers believe that the presence of echolucent areas within the mass suggests a myxoma with central degeneration, whereas other authors contend that the same appearance may be seen in patients with an intraatrial thrombus[2](#core-r002). CT scanning and MRI scanning can also demonstrate intracardiac tumors and, in the unusual case of a lipoma or lipomatous infiltration of the septum, can suggest the diagnosis on the basis of the characteristic imaging qualities of fat[1](#core-r001). Angiographic examination has been used less frequently since the advent of two-dimensional echocardiographic examination.The treatment for primary cardiac tumors is surgical excision. Its results for benign tumors, particularly myxomas, are good, with low recurrence rates and good long-term survival[28](#core-r028). Surgical results in patients with malignant tumors are not as good. In most cases a surgical procedure is undertaken to establish the diagnosis. Resection of a malignant tumor mass sometimes results in palliation of symptoms. In cases in which invasion and occlusion of pulmonary veins have occurred, resection of the involved pulmonary tissue may be undertaken at the time of the excision of the cardiac mass.In conclusion, it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis before the diagnostic procedure in this case. I favor a left atrial tumor with possible occlusion of pulmonary veins. I favor the diagnosis of a primary rather than a secondary cardiac tumor, because the patient's age and habits make a primary lung neoplasm very unlikely and there is no evidence of another primary tumor. If the pulmonary veins were involved, it might have been possible to establish the diagnosis with a \u201cpull-back\u201d cytologic aspirate obtained through the pulmonary-artery catheter while it was in the wedge position. In this clinical setting, however, I suspect that the decision was to move quickly to a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic excision of the echogenic left atrial mass, which was probably a myxoma. If pulmonary venous invasion was found at the time of this excision, resection of the affected portion of the lung could also have been undertaken.Dr. Eugene J. Mark: Dr. O'Gara, will you comment on your impressions before the diagnostic procedure?Dr. Patrick T. O'Gara: I saw the patient just before a transesophageal echocardiographic study was performed. I thought that he had an atrial myxoma with pulmonary edema, but I was perplexed by the high cardiac output. In view of the size and visibility of the mass, I thought that it was responsible for severe mitral-inflow obstruction, and I had expected that his systemic output would prove to have been markedly decreased. I postulated that his acute presentation might have been caused by an abrupt increase in the size of the mass, perhaps as a result of hemorrhage within it, with an associated increase in mitral-orifice obstruction. I did not think that he had an important amount of mitral regurgitation.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Nidorf: The diagnostic procedure was a transesophageal echocardiographic study, which confirmed the presence of a large, smooth multilobular mass containing sonolucent areas; the mass prolapsed freely across the mitral valve and well into the cavity of the left ventricle. The mass was attached to a pedicle that arose from the inferior portion of the left atrial septum, adjacent to the mitral annulus ([Figure 1](#f01)). There was some thickening along the atrial septum at the base of the pedicle. The mitral leaflets themselves appeared normal. At the time of the study, with the patient supine, there was no Doppler evidence of a gradient across the valve, and only mild mitral regurgitation was detected by color flow Doppler examination. The left atrium was dilated. The left ventricular function was normal. The only other finding of note was the presence of a small circumferential pericardial effusion.In conclusion, the features described are characteristic of a solitary left atrial myxoma arising from the left side of the inferior basal portion of the interatrial septum.Dr. Mark: Shortly after the echocardiographic procedure a median sternotomy was performed. The pericardium was found to contain 120 ml of clear, straw-colored fluid. In the left atrium there was a large hemorrhagic, gelatinous mass on a pedicle attached to the inferior atrial septum. The mass was excised, along with a small rim of underlying atrial muscle. The anterior leaflet of the mitral valve was slightly thickened as a result of trauma from the tumor.The resected tumor was 4 cm in greatest dimension and had a pedicle 1.5 cm wide. Sectioning disclosed cystic spaces up to 1 cm in diameter filled with pink gelatinous fluid ([Figure 2](#f02)). These cysts accounted for the irregular echogenic character of the mass on the echocardiographic study. Microscopical examination revealed microcysts ([Figure 3](#f03)) lined by small polyhedral cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. These cells appeared epithelioid when they formed a monolayer or formed micropapillae. Invaginations from the endocardial surface were lined by similar polyhedral cells. Within abundant myxoid stroma there were individual stellate mesenchymal cells with bland nuclei ([Figure 4](#f04)) and an arborizing network of arterioles and venules ringed by polyhedral cells ([Figure 5](#f05)). The epithelioid cells and the stellate cells stained strongly for vimentin and weakly for \u03b1-1-antitrypsin, \u03b1-1-antichymotrypsin, and \u03b1-smooth-muscle actin. A variety of reactions for mesenchymal and epithelial markers have been seen in other atrial myxomas and indicate multipotential differentiation of the mesenchymal cells[29\u201331](#core-r029). The epithelioid cells and the stellate cells stained negative for keratin, epithelial membrane antigen, Leu-7 antigen, S-100 antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, factor VIII, ulex antigen, desmin, and muscle actin.It is surprising how such a large tumor could have caused symptoms for only one week. The shortest duration of symptoms before the diagnosis in one series of 24 patients with cardiac myxoma was two months[32](#core-r032). It is possible that symptoms had been present previously but were ignored by the patient. Perhaps torsion caused rapid cystic degeneration with hemorrhage into the cysts. Hemosiderin was present in small amounts, and some of the cysts contained fresh blood. Quick expansion of the tumor over a week then could have caused critical obstruction of blood flow from the pulmonary veins or through the mitral valve, or both. Cardiac myxoma produces systemic symptoms in many patients and did so in this patient. Fever of otherwise undetermined origin was found in 2 of 130 patients in one series[8](#core-r008). The arthralgias, myalgias, fatigue, anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated sedimentation rate observed in this patient have all been encountered in other patients with cardiac myxomas[8,29,32](#core-r008).Dr. Reilly: In regard to Dr. Mark's point about the chronicity of the disease, for this patient to present to the hospital with an albumin level of 1.8 g per deciliter despite being previously healthy and asymptomatic would be very unusual, and one wonders whether he had had previous symptoms. In addition, the hemoptysis and chest pain, which could have been due simply to pulmonary hypertension associated with this mass, may have also reflected a transient acute positional occlusion of the mitral valve, with an abrupt rise in pulmonary pressures. Certainly, to present with a wedge pressure of 30 mm Hg, even though the transesophageal echocardiographic study with the patient recumbent did not show a large gradient across the mitral valve, suggests that at some point during the natural history of this disorder, perhaps when the patient was upright or in other positions, there were hemodynamic effects due to movement into and out of the valve orifice.Dr. Brian J. Morrison: It was remarkable how quickly the patient's condition improved postoperatively. The abnormalities shown on x-ray examination of the chest cleared within 24 hours, and he was extubated within 24 hours and up and about within three days.\n",

      "question": "An 81-year-old, right-handed man was admitted to the hospital because of progressive disorientation and repeated falls.\nThe patient had been well until six weeks earlier, when he was believed to have been in an unwitnessed automobile accident, with swelling of the forehead. There were scratches on his car, but he could not recall details of the accident. He began to fall frequently and had episodes of slurred speech. He became unable to dress himself, prepare his own meals, or care for a grandchild. He became lost while crossing the street to visit his children's home and often failed to recognize them in photographs. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cranial examination was normal.\nThree weeks before admission, he was apparently involved in another automobile accident. During the two weeks before admission, he had difficulty finding words and could not complete sentences. His family brought him to this hospital.\nThe patient had a six-year history of Meniere's syndrome, characterized by impaired hearing that was more prominent in the left ear, with intermittent bouts of vertigo. He had lost 9 kg of weight during his illness. There was no history of witnessed loss of consciousness or seizures, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, stroke, cancer, risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection, chronic infection or autoimmune disease, exposure to toxic substances, headache, use of illicit drugs, use of alcohol or tobacco, incontinence of the bladder or bowel, visual disturbances, fever, sweats, focal weakness, paresthesias, dysphagia, chest pain, or rash; and there was no family history of neurologic disease.\nThe temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the pulse was 84, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 150/70 mm Hg.\nOn examination, the patient was alert and trying to get out of bed. The general physical examination was normal except for a maxillary ecchymosis. On neurologic examination, the patient was awake and alert but easily distracted. He was oriented to person and place but not to time. His speech was fluent, but with paraphasic errors, neologisms, intermittent echolalia, and poor repetition. He confused his right and left sides and misidentified his fingers. When asked to count backward from 10 to 1, he counted from 10 to 20; he could perform only the simplest calculations with single digits. He recalled one of three objects immediately and none after five minutes. He was able to write his name; he copied a square but not interlocking squares, a triangle, or a circle. No glabellar, grasp, palmomental, or startle reflex was elicited. The cranial-nerve functions were preserved, except for poor vision, inaccurate pursuit in all directions, and bilaterally diminished hearing. Muscle strength and tone were normal, without abnormal movements except for a mild tremor of his arms when outstretched. The sensations of light touch and a pinprick were intact. His gait was characterized by a normal rhythm and arm swing but a slightly widened stance. Romberg's test was negative. He compensated poorly when jostled. The deep-tendon reflexes were + in the arms, ++ at the knees, and absent at the ankles; the plantar responses were flexor.\nThe urine was trace positive for protein and otherwise normal. The values for the prothrombin time, the partial-thromboplastin time, and folate were normal. The results of other hematologic tests are shown in\nTable 1\n. Serum tests for the presence of 66 drugs of abuse were negative. Tests for antibodies to double-stranded DNA, Sm, U1-RNP, smooth muscle, parietal cells, anticardiolipin IgG and IgM, and\nBorrelia burgdorferi\nwere negative, as was a serologic test for syphilis. The results of agarose-gel electrophoresis were normal. The results of other immunologic tests are shown in\nTable 2\n.\nRadiographs of the chest were normal. A computed tomographic (CT) cranial scan, performed without the intravenous injection of contrast material, showed a hyperdense elongated right periventricular area high within the convexity of the white matter, without evidence of surrounding edema or mass effect. The ventricles appeared normal. There was nonspecific low attenuation within the periventricular white matter. No evidence of extracerebral fluid collection was observed. Calcifications were noted in the cavernous portions of the carotid arteries. The orbits and paranasal sinuses appeared normal. A lumbar puncture was performed. A cerebrospinal fluid culture and a test for syphilis were negative. Other cerebrospinal fluid findings are shown in\nTable 3\n. A cranial MRI scan obtained before and after the intravenous injection of gadolinium revealed an area of enhancement, 18 mm by 4 mm by 4 mm, in the right postcentral gyrus near the convexity (\nFigure 1\n). On the T\n2\n-weighted image (\nFigure 2\n), there was hypointensity in the same region, a finding consistent with calcification or previous hemorrhage. The abnormalities corresponded to the region of hyperdensity observed on the CT scan and were consistent with a small cavernous malformation. There was also a linear signal void, with enhancement on the images obtained after the administration of gadolinium, that extended superiorly to the convexity and inferiorly to the subependymal region, a finding consistent with an associated venous anomaly. No evidence of mass effect was noted. There was mild cortical and central atrophy, without a shift of midline structures or abnormal fluid collections. The flow signal within the major intracranial vessels was unremarkable. There was minimal periventricular hyperintensity on T\n2\n-weighted images. The paranasal sinuses were clear. A cerebral angiographic examination showed no evidence of vasculitis. A culture of the urine and two blood cultures were sterile.\nOn the second hospital day, the patient was much more lucid, with no evidence of a language deficit. During the next few days, he had two bouts of delirium, each of 16 hours' duration. During the first episode, an electroencephalographic study performed while the patient was awake revealed generalized slowing without consistent focal features and occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves, obscured by much muscle and movement artifact. During sleep, the results were normal.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. David N. Caplan[\\*](#FN1): This elderly man had a subacute confusional process that waxed and waned in severity.Acute and subacute confusional states are common in the elderly. Up to a third of patients over the age of 65 years are confused on admission to a hospital, and another 15 to 20 percent have confusion or delirium during their hospital stay.[1](#core-r001) The hallmark of a confusional state is the inability to sustain a normal level of arousal or attention. Confusional states are associated with disorders of spoken and written language, praxis, memory, and other cognitive functions,[2](#core-r002) which may be due in part to the primary attention problem.Confusional states are commonly caused by metabolic disorders, infections, pulmonary and cardiac failure, and other systemic conditions.[3](#core-r003) This patient had anemia, elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, and a low calcium level, but these abnormalities were probably too slight to have caused his cognitive deterioration. They did not fluctuate in a way that could account for the temporal course of his symptoms. I shall therefore consider diseases that affect the central nervous system more specifically.Bacterial, viral, rickettsial, spirochetal, and fungal infections of the brain and meninges are common causes of confusion, but the absence of signs of infection in the cerebrospinal fluid and the absence of nuchal rigidity make central nervous system infections unlikely. Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, herpes simplex encephalitis, and Lyme disease are specifically unlikely, because the electroencephalographic findings, CT and MRI studies, and serologic results do not support the diagnoses.Because of the history of trauma and the presentation with a facial ecchymosis, I must also consider brain injury as a possible cause of this patient's cognitive disorder. The CT and MRI scans can be useful in the diagnosis of post-traumatic brain injury. May we see them now?Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: The CT scan showed a hyperdense focus in the right-parietal-lobe white matter, extending from the region of the right lateral ventricle superiorly to the cortex in the region of the postcentral gyrus, and mild cortical atrophy. The MRI scan showed a signal abnormality in the same region. On a scan obtained with the use of a magnetic-susceptibility\u2013sensitive pulse sequence, the abnormality appeared as a focus of hyperintensity surrounded by a region with a very low signal ([Figure 2](#f02)). The low signal was consistent with either calcification or, more likely, old blood products. The abnormality appeared to be linear and was intensely enhanced after the administration of contrast material ([Figure 1](#f01)). This constellation of findings suggests a venous anomaly, possibly associated with a cavernous malformation that had previously bled. The T2- and proton-weighted images showed a few nonspecific foci of increased signal in the deep white matter. Mild cortical atrophy was evident. The angiogram revealed a minor irregularity of the internal carotid arteries, but the intracranial arteries appeared normal. During the venous phase, an anomalous vein was visible in the right parietal lobe.Dr. Caplan: The clinical picture could not have resulted from the small cavernous malformation in the parietal lobe, and neither the CT scan nor the MRI scan shows evidence of contusions, which could have accounted for the presentation. Chronic subdural hematoma can cause confusion but is more likely to produce stupor than delirium, and this diagnosis is also ruled out by the MRI and CT studies. White-matter shearing after a closed head injury can produce cognitive impairments and be difficult to diagnose radiologically, but it would be a very unlikely cause of this patient's symptoms, because there were no other signs of central nervous system dysfunction at the time of the head trauma.[4,5](#core-r004)Strokes and other acutely developing lesions (traumatic contusions, primary and metastatic tumors, and abscesses) can cause confusional states with few motor or sensory disorders when the lesions are located in the anterior portions of the frontal lobes,[6](#core-r006) the right parietal lobe,[7](#core-r007) the left superior temporal lobe (Wernicke's area) (personal observation), either inferior temporal lobe,[8](#core-r008) the occipital and medial regions supplied by the basilar artery (\u201ctop of the basilar\u201d syndrome),[9](#core-r009) or the anterolateral part of the thalamus.[10](#core-r010) In this case, however, the CT and MRI scans and the cerebral angiogram provide no evidence of these disorders.I must consider diseases that affect the brain without revealing their full extent on CT, MRI, or angiographic examination in a patient with evidence of a systemic illness \u2014 weight loss, anemia associated with chronic disease, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a positive test for antinuclear antibodies, a borderline vitamin B12 level with an abnormal Schilling test, and a high protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid.The borderline vitamin B12 level and abnormal gait suggest subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord with mental changes. In one study, 3 of 141 patients with B12 deficiency but without macrocytic anemia had cognitive changes, abnormal gait, and normal sensation of pain or touch, as in this patient.[11](#core-r011) The absence of parietal-cell antibodies in this patient, however, as well as the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and positive test for antinuclear antibodies, is not consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. Another nutritional disease that can produce confusional states, Wernicke's encephalopathy, is also unlikely because there was no history of malnutrition or alcoholism and the characteristic eye movements of that disorder were absent.Another condition in which mental changes are associated with systemic disease is paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis. Symptoms of this disorder, including personality change and memory impairment, have been associated with cancers of many organs but are most commonly a complication of small-cell carcinoma of the lung.[12,13](#core-r012) The typical limbic encephalopathy associated with small-cell lung cancer affects memory more than language, praxis, or other cognitive abilities,[14](#core-r014) which is not consistent with the cognitive profile in this case, and the mental state does not usually return nearly to normal after delirium in the course of 24 hours. However, the mental-state abnormalities in this patient are not outside the range of abnormalities seen in patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis. The patient's chest film was normal, but as many as half of patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis present with central nervous system signs before a cancer is found.[12](#core-r012) A high level of antinuclear antibodies is not characteristic of paraneoplastic disease, and anti-Hu antibodies, which are found in patients with the disease,[15](#core-r015) were not present in this patient. In short, there is no evidence of a small-cell lung cancer or other cancer associated with a paraneoplastic limbic encephalopathy in this patient. A CT scan of the lungs and a test for antineuronal antibodies would have been helpful diagnostically.Vasculitis can also be present without CT, MRI, or angiographic abnormalities,[16](#core-r016) and several features of this patient's course suggest that diagnosis. Subacute cognitive changes are common when vasculitis affects the central nervous system, and episodes of delirium lasting less than a day can be due to transient hypoxic episodes or to nonconvulsive epileptiform discharges. Weight loss, anemia associated with chronic disease, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein level, and an abnormal electroencephalogram are all common features of vasculitis syndromes. A mild pleocytosis is common but is not seen in all cases.[17](#core-r017)Vasculitic diseases that affect the central nervous system include systemic necrotizing, rheumatologic, and primary central nervous system forms. Polyarteritis nodosa is associated with central nervous system symptoms in 20 to 40 percent of patients. An encephalopathy with cognitive changes is one common central nervous system presentation, and the symptoms can evolve in hours and resolve in days to weeks, as in this patient. Tinnitus, vertigo, and unilateral hearing loss, which this patient had, occur in 5 percent of patients with polyarteritis nodosa.[18](#core-r018) However, antinuclear antibodies are not usually present in high titers,[19](#core-r019) the neurologic manifestations more commonly affect the peripheral nervous system,[17](#core-r017) and they are usually accompanied by signs of systemic vasculitis. Churg\u2013Strauss vasculitis is associated with eosinophilia and pulmonary disease,[20](#core-r020) of which there is no evidence in this patient. In temporal arteritis, loss of vision is the most common neurologic manifestation but may not occur. Headache, temporal-artery tenderness, and polymyalgia rheumatica, none of which were present in this case, are frequent symptoms. In addition, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in this patient was slightly lower than that usually seen with temporal arteritis. Giant-cell arteritis also occurs in Takayasu's disease, but it principally affects the aortic arch. Wegener's granulomatosis can cause confusional states but is more commonly associated with mononeuritis multiplex and cranial-nerve palsies.[21](#core-r021) This patient did not have the upper respiratory tract and renal involvement characteristic of Wegener's granulomatosis, and antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies were not found. Central nervous system sarcoidosis usually produces cranial-nerve abnormalities and is associated with a high level of angiotensin-converting enzyme.[22](#core-r022) On rare occasions, lymphomatoid granulomatosis (now thought to be a T-cell lymphoma rather than a vasculitis) affects only the central nervous system, but it is usually associated with fever, respiratory symptoms, and cutaneous lesions. Cryoglobulinemia and Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura are also unlikely in the absence of any characteristic findings.The rheumatologic syndromes that can be associated with central nervous system vasculitis include systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective-tissue disease, Beh\u00e7et's syndrome, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, progressive systemic sclerosis, and Reiter's syndrome. This patient had no physical or serologic evidence of rheumatoid arthritis or mixed connective-tissue disease. The negative test for antibodies to U1-RNP is also evidence against mixed connective-tissue disease. Beh\u00e7et's syndrome is associated with genital and oral ulcers, although neurologic symptoms can occur without them.[23](#core-r023) Twenty percent of patients with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome have central nervous system symptoms,[24](#core-r024) but the syndrome is associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca and antineuronal antibodies, which were not present in this case. There were no signs of progressive systemic sclerosis or Reiter's syndrome.Systemic lupus erythematosus warrants consideration because of the elevated titer of antinuclear antibodies. Although only a small percentage of patients with this disorder have neuropsychiatric symptoms initially,[25](#core-r025) they develop in more than a third of patients, usually early in the course of the disease.[26](#core-r026) Of the 11 diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus, however, only 2 were met in this case: an elevated level of antinuclear antibodies and changes in the mental state; 4 criteria are required to make the diagnosis. The tests for highly specific double-stranded\u2013DNA, Sm, and U1-RNP antibodies were negative. The sensitivity of these markers individually ranges from 25 to 75 percent.[27](#core-r027) Thus, this patient probably did not have systemic lupus erythematosus. A stroke syndrome associated with circulating lupus anticoagulants and antiphospholipid antibodies is also unlikely because of the patient's age and the negative test for anticardiolipin antibodies, although some patients have lupus anticoagulants without anticardiolipin antibodies.[28](#core-r028)Nonetheless, I cannot ignore the strongly positive test for antinuclear antibodies. Only 5 percent of normal persons have positive tests for antinuclear antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence, and abnormal titers are usually lower than 1:320, are often less than 1:40, and show a homogeneous staining pattern.[27](#core-r027) The presence of a speckled pattern of antinuclear antibodies in a titer of 1:2540 in the absence of Sm, double-stranded\u2013DNA, or RNP antibodies and presumably in the absence of other antinuclear antibodies is a nonspecific but strong indicator of systemic inflammatory disease.Vasculitic diseases that affect the central nervous system exclusively often begin with cognitive changes and are associated with an elevated level of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as slowing and sharp waves on the electroencephalogram. Pleocytosis is usually found. MRI and CT scans and angiographic studies can be normal.Primary angiitis of the central nervous system usually develops over a period of three months or more and is marked by headaches and focal signs.[29](#core-r029) A more aggressive form of angiitis, idiopathic granulomatous angiitis of the central nervous system, which mainly affects small arteries, causes a diffuse encephalopathy with progression to obtundation and coma over a period of a few weeks.[30](#core-r030) In one review, only 56 percent of angiographic studies in patients with biopsy-confirmed idiopathic granulomatous angiitis of the central nervous system were abnormal, and only 11 percent showed changes diagnostic of vasculitis.[30](#core-r030) The absence of pleocytosis is unusual in this disorder, but the number of white cells in the cerebrospinal fluid can be small. In one review, there were 0 to 9 white cells per cubic millimeter in the cerebrospinal fluid in 20 percent of biopsy-confirmed cases.[30](#core-r030) A strongly positive test for antinuclear antibodies is unusual in patients with idiopathic granulomatous angiitis of the central nervous system. However, vasculitis can affect mainly small intracranial vessels, with giant-cell arteritis affecting larger intracranial vessels,[31](#core-r031) and a systemic vasculitis can be associated with infections and neoplasms, especially lymphomas, leukemia, and Hodgkin's disease.[32,33](#core-r032) In one study, 11 of 38 postmortem examinations of patients with presumed primary vasculitis of the central nervous system revealed vasculitis outside the brain that had been asymptomatic.[34](#core-r034) A number of other mixed angiopathic findings have been described in patients with systemic vasculitis. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy has been reported in association with cerebral giant-cell arteritis,[35](#core-r035) rheumatoid arthritis,[36](#core-r036) and other conditions. I am not aware of any association of a primary central nervous system angiitis with an isolated elevated level of antinuclear antibodies, although intracranial giant-cell arteritis has been reported in association with systemic lupus erythematosus.[37](#core-r037)Three other very rare forms of vascular disease, each of which has a clinical feature similar to a feature of this patient's disease, warrant mention. The first is intravascular lymphomatosis, in which lymphoma, usually of the B-lymphocyte type, proliferates within small vessels, leading to occlusions and hemorrhage. The disease should be considered in this case because it has a predilection for the central nervous system, where it often produces a rapidly progressive dementia before causing death.[38](#core-r038) Other possible features of the disease that are similar to those in this case are a high protein level and an absence of white cells in the cerebrospinal fluid,[39](#core-r039) a normal angiographic examination, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.[38](#core-r038) Indeed, in the absence of an extraneurologic tumor, intravascular lymphomatosis can be indistinguishable from idiopathic granulomatous angiitis of the central nervous system,[29](#core-r029) and I cannot rule out this diagnosis. The chief argument against it is the high level of antinuclear antibodies.The second rare condition is angiodysgenetic necrotizing encephalopathy (the van Bogaert\u2013Divry syndrome), a disease in which diffuse meningocerebral angiomatosis produces small hemorrhages leading to a necrotizing encephalopathy with prominent cognitive symptoms.[40](#core-r040) This diagnosis is unlikely, because it is usually associated with widespread hemorrhage when the mental state has deteriorated to the extent seen in this case.The third rare disease is subacute diencephalic angioencephalopathy, which is characterized by subacute fluctuating cognitive disturbances on presentation and deterioration within a few weeks.[41](#core-r041) In some cases, the cerebrospinal fluid protein level is elevated without pleocytosis, the angiographic examination is normal, and CT and MRI scans are normal before the disease becomes well entrenched.[42](#core-r042) Subacute diencephalic angioencephalopathy is a combined vasculitis and encephalopathy located chiefly in the diencephalon, especially the thalamus. In this disorder, strokes can produce a wide range of cognitive impairments[9](#core-r009) and are associated with considerable fluctuation in cognitive functions.[43](#core-r043) All the features of subacute diencephalic angioencephalopathy were found in this patient.In conclusion, this case presents a diagnostic challenge. The principal location of the disease was the brain, particularly in the cortex or the diencephalic structures that support attention, or both. The number of cognitive domains that were impaired and the degree of fluctuation of these symptoms are more suggestive of a vasculitis than a paraneoplastic encephalopathy. I therefore conclude that the patient had a vasculitis that mainly involved the central nervous system but that was associated with an inflammatory process elsewhere. I suspect that the diagnosis was made on the basis of a brain biopsy.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. David N. Louis: The diagnostic procedure included biopsies of the right temporal artery, frontal dura mater, and frontal cortex. Microscopical examination of the temporal artery and dura was negative. In the brain, however, multiple small vessels were filled with large malignant cells ([Figure 3](#f03)). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that these cells were of B-cell, lymphocytic lineage ([Figure 4](#f04)) and expressed kappa, but not lambda, light chains. Some vessels were surrounded by scanty collections of small, reactive-appearing lymphocytes, which stained for T-cell markers. The surrounding white matter appeared unremarkable, without evidence of infarction or demyelination. These histologic findings are characteristic of intravascular lymphomatosis of the brain,[44\u201346](#core-r044) an often challenging diagnosis.Intravascular lymphomatosis usually affects the nervous system and skin, but involvement of most organs has been reported.[44,46](#core-r044) The mechanisms whereby the neoplastic lymphocytes home to endothelial cells, without migrating into the surrounding parenchyma, are unclear but are probably related to the expression of particular lymphocyte\u2013endothelium adhesion molecules.[45](#core-r045) Vascular occlusion by the neoplastic cells usually causes one of four syndromes: progressive, multifocal infarctions; paraparesis, pain, and incontinence; subacute encephalopathy; or cranial or peripheral neuropathy.[44](#core-r044) In a recent case record, a patient with intravascular lymphomatosis had multiple nervous system infarcts, resulting predominantly in a spinal cord syndrome.[45](#core-r045) In the present case, the subacute encephalopathy most likely also resulted from scattered, small ischemic insults.Dr. Lyndon Kim: Intravascular lymphomatosis with central nervous system involvement is associated with a very poor prognosis. In a review of 86 cases, the diagnosis was made in almost half of them at autopsy; when the diagnosis was made before death, the median survival was about five months.[47](#core-r047) Although there have been a few cases of long-term responses to systemic chemotherapy,[46,48](#core-r046) responses to corticosteroid therapy and various types of chemotherapy have been mostly transient.[38,44,49](#core-r038) In this case, the patient was treated initially with dexamethasone, with some improvement. Subsequently, he received six cycles of high-dose intravenous methotrexate therapy over a five-month period. Since no mass was demonstrable on imaging studies, we monitored his mental status, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and levels of antinuclear antibodies, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and haptoglobin as indexes of disease activity. After two cycles of methotrexate, he became ambulatory, fed and dressed himself, and prepared for a vacation in Florida by participating in an intensive rehabilitation program. All the follow-up indexes improved after each course of chemotherapy, but there was a slow, progressive deterioration of his condition thereafter, with numerous hematologic and infectious complications. He died five months after the diagnostic procedure.Dr. Louis: An autopsy, which was restricted to the brain, heart, and lungs, revealed extensive intravascular lymphoma at all three sites. No extravascular lymphoma was identified. The cerebral white matter contained multiple small, recent infarcts ([Figure 5](#f05)), which may have contributed to the encephalopathy. Incidental findings were a venous angioma or anomaly in the right parietal white matter and capillary telangiectases in the left middle temporal gyrus and right cerebellar hemisphere.Dr. Caplan: This case illustrates the value of early cerebral biopsy in patients with confusional states of uncertain cause. This man's course was improved by treatment, and there have been other cases in which primary angiitis of the central nervous system was diagnosed only by brain biopsy and responded to immunosuppressive treatment.\n",

      "question": "First admission\n. A 53-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of disseminated intravascular coagulation.\nShe was well until one month earlier, when she entered another hospital because of deep thrombophlebitis of the left leg. Anticoagulant treatment was given, but hematuria developed. After the therapy was discontinued signs of deep thrombophlebitis appeared in the right leg; heparin was administered, with improvement. After discontinuance of heparin the patient was found to have a prolonged partial thromboplastin time, diminished fibrinogen and an elevated titer of fibrin-split products. Heparin therapy was resumed, and she was transferred to this hospital.\nThe patient had married at 42 years of age; the menopause occurred soon thereafter, and she never conceived. She had been examined regularly by a gynecologist and had not taken oral contraceptives or estrogens. A sister had had endometrial carcinoma.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 80, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 125/80 mm Hg.\nExamination, including pelvic and rectal examination, was negative except for signs of bilateral pleural effusions and a whitish vaginal discharge.\nUrinalysis disclosed innumerable white cells and 10 red cells per high-power field in the sediment. The hematocrit was 30.3 per cent; the white-cell count was 7000, with a normal differential count; the platelet count was 225,000. The prothrombin time was 12 seconds, with a control of 11.2 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 32.9 seconds. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The urea nitrogen was 10 mg, the glucose 87 mg, and the protein 6.8 g (the albumin 3.2 g, and the globulin 3.6 g) per 100 ml. The lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) was 128 U, the alkaline phosphatase 14.7 Bodansky U, and the 5\u2032 nucleotidase 5.6 Bodansky U (normal, 0.3 to 3.2 Bodansky U). X-ray films of the chest showed bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right side. A right-sided thoracentesis yielded 75 ml of cloudy, yellow fluid that contained 170 red cells and 2180 white cells per cubic millimeter; a differential count disclosed 35 per cent neutrophils, 32 per cent lymphocytes and 33 per cent mesothelial cells; the glucose was 118 mg, and the protein 4.5 g per 100 ml; the LDH was 166 U; cytologic examination disclosed no tumor cells, and a culture yielded no growth of micro-organisms. Microscopical examination of the vaginal secretions revealed no tumor cells. A test for alpha-fetoprotein was negative. A culture of urine gave no bacterial growth.\nHeparin was administered by vein. On the second hospital day the patient complained of dyspnea and left-sided chest pain. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while she was breathing room air, revealed that the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO\n2\n) was 52 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO\n2\n) 34 mm Hg, and the pH 7.43. A\n133\nXe ventilation pulmonary scan disclosed diffuse trapping in the left lung. A\n99m\nTc human albumin microaggregate (HAM) perfusion pulmonary scan showed multiple defects in both upper lung fields, the region of the lingula, the right lower lobe and the right middle lobe. An inferior venacavagraphic examination, performed via the right femoral vein, demonstrated a normal appearance of the inferior vena cava. A pulmonary angiographic study showed large to massive proximal emboli in both lungs; the pressure was 50/14 mm Hg in the pulmonary artery, 40/0 mm Hg in the right ventricle, 16/18 mm Hg in the right atrium, and 8 mm Hg in the inferior vena cava. A\n99m\nTc sulfur-colloid liver-spleen scan was negative.\nLigation of the inferior vena cava was performed; heparin was resumed, and hydrochloride was administered. On the 15th hospital day a\n75\nSe-methia-nine pancreatic scan was negative. On the following day an intravenous pyelographic examination showed a hazy density, 12 cm in transverse diameter, in the pelvis; the size and contour of the kidneys appeared normal, and the calyxes and ureters were normal in outline and position; the dome of the bladder was compressed, apparently by the pelvic density; a small residuum of urine was observed after voiding. The abdomen was too distended for adequate palpation of the pelvic organs. Vaginal examination disclosed a probable mass anterior to the uterus, consistent with uterine leiomyoma. An endometrial biopsy was performed; the uterine cavity was 6 cm deep; microscopical examination of the biopsy specimen revealed basal endometrium with slightly atypical hyperplasia. On a repeated determination the alkaline phosphatase was 18.5 Bodansky U, and the 5\u2032 nucleotidase was 8.4 Bodansky U. A needle-aspiration biopsy of the bone marrow showed no abnormality. An abdominal ultrasound examination disclosed that the uterus appeared enlarged, with multiple complex internal echoes. An oral cholecystographic study and an intravenous cholangiographic examination were negative. An upper gastrointestinal series revealed a sliding hiatus hernia, with gastroesophageal reflux; no evidence of esophagitis was seen, and the stomach and duodenum appeared normal. A barium-enema examination demonstrated a soft-tissue density within the pelvis; the colon appeared normal. Fiberoptic endoscopic examination showed a normal appearance of the stomach, duodenal loop and ampulla of Vater; attempted cannulation of the ampulla was unsuccessful.\nThe dose of heparin was slowly tapered, and warfarin was begun. On the 47th hospital day superficial phlebitis was observed in the left leg; it improved on ambulation. On the 51st hospital day the alkaline phosphatase was 41.3 Bodansky U. The patient was discharged on the 53d hospital day on warfarin, dipyridamole and hydrochlorothiazide.\nSecond admission\n(five weeks later). The patient felt well until one week before entry, when progressive dyspnea developed. A repeated\n99m\nTc sulfur-colloid liver-spleen scan showed no abnormality. Another abdominal ultrasound study (\nFig. 1\n) demonstrated a solid mass, 12 by 15 cm, in the midline of the pelvis; the mass appeared considerably larger than on the previous study; a moderate amount of ascitic fluid was present; the uterus was not identified. She was read-mitted to the hospital.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse 120, and the respirations 28. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient was pale and in respiratory distress. There were signs of bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right side. The abdomen was distended, with a fluid wave; a mass was felt at the level of the umbilicus. Vaginal and rectal examinations disclosed increased fullness within the pelvis in comparison with the findings on the previous admission. The extremities were normal.\nThe urine gave a ++ test for protein; the sediment contained 10 white cells and innumerable red cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 36.8 per cent; the white-cell count was 13,600, with a normal differential count; the platelet count was 170,000. The prothrombin was 23.9 seconds, with a control of 10.7 seconds. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The urea nitrogen was 18 mg, and the protein 7.5 g (the albumin 3.4 g, and the globulin 4.1 g) per 100 ml. The LDH was 104 U, the amylase 8 U, the alkaline phosphatase 62.1 Bodansky U, and the 5\u2032 nucleotidase 27.9 Bodansky U. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 135, with low voltage in all the leads. X-ray films of the chest showed a large right pleural effusion and a moderate left pleural effusion. A film of the abdomen disclosed a hazy soft-tissue density throughout the abdomen and pelvis. The carcinoembryonic antigen was 8.3 ng per milliliter (normal, 0 to 2.5 ng in 95 per cent of non-smokers); tests for alpha-fetoprotein and the beta sub-unit of human chorionic gonadotropin were negative. Microscopical examination of the vaginal secretions disclosed no tumor cells.\nIntravenous infusion of heparin was resumed, and hydrochlorothiazide was administered. A right-sided thoracentesis yielded 1350 ml of cloudy, yellow fluid; the glucose was 178 mg, and the protein 4.8 g per 100 ml; the LDH was 86 U; cytologic examination disclosed no tumor cells, and a culture showed no bacterial growth. An abdominal paracentesis yielded 400 ml of cloudy, yellow fluid; the glucose was 116 mg, and the protein 4.3 g per 100 ml; cytologic examination disclosed no tumor cells, and a culture gave no growth of micro-organisms. Repeated abdominal paracentesis yielded 2.5 liters of clear, brown fluid, and 1700 ml of fluid was withdrawn on a repeated right-sided thoracentesis. The patient remained dyspneic, and 1500 ml of serosanguineous fluid was removed from the left pleural cavity. The alkaline phosphatase rose to 82.8 Bodansky U; a heat test showed 94 per cent residuum.\nAn operation was performed on the 16th hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. C. Thomas Griffiths\\*: In summary, we have the problem of a 53-year-old woman with chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) that antedated the detection of a presumably malignant pelvic tumor. The DIC was only partially controlled by anticoagulation, and multiple large pulmonary emboli necessitated vena-cava ligation. Although abdominal exploration was deferred to stabilize the coagulation disorder the patient's condition deteriorated, with progressive growth of the tumor, and its removal became imperative. Before proceeding with the discussion, may we see the x-ray films and sonograms?Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: A film of the chest taken on the first admission shows a moderate amount of fluid in both pleural spaces. The lung scan, which was performed with technetium macroaggregates, demonstrates multiple segmental perfusion defects on both sides. The xenon pulmonary ventilation study reveals diminished ventilation and air trapping on the left side with excellent ventilation throughout the right lung. The pulmonary angiographic study subsequently demonstrated multiple diffuse thrombi, including one massive clot in the left main pulmonary artery.The evaluation of the pelvic disease was carried out with intravenous urograms, which show normal upper tracts and ureters and a poorly defined central soft-tissue pelvic mass indenting the dome of the bladder. No calcification is visible within the mass. The remainder of the abdominal structures appear normal. The films from the barium-enema examination reveal some elevation of the sigmoid but no fixation or invasion and no indication in the remainder of the colon of a primary neoplasm.A film of the chest obtained on the second admission shows an increase in the bilateral pleural effusions, much more marked on the right side. The size of the heart is slightly increased, but the cardiac margins are somewhat obscured on both sides by the overlying pleural fluid.The initial ultrasound study, made with gray-scale technic, demonstrates in the parasagittal projection a supravesical soft-tissue mass, about 11 cm in diameter, with rather dense, clumped internal echoes indicating its solid nature. The mass was thought to be inseparable from the uterine fundus. The repeated ultrasound examination ([Fig. 1](#f001)) before the second admission discloses an increase in the diameter of the solid mass to almost 15 cm. A small amount of fluid is visible in the cul de sac and in both flanks.Dr. Griffiths: A brief discussion of the association between thrombotic states and malignant neoplasia is in order. In 1865 Armand Trousseau described the occasional concurrence of cancer and thrombophlebitis, which was often migratory. It is now apparent that the phlebitis of Trousseau's syndrome is the most common manifestation of a chronic form of DIC. Less often, a hemorrhagic phenomenon results from the consumption of clotting factors, or arterial emboli originate from nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is another manifestation of chronic DIC. In view of the many factors that may initiate the clotting mechanism it is not surprising that more than one factor associated with the neoplastic state has been implicated as a cause of DIC. In some cases the extrinsic pathway is activated by the release of thromboplastin from tissues injured by the invading tumor or by a high level of thromboplastic substances in the tumor itself. In another situation endothelial disruption within or adjacent to a tumor may result in the release of Hageman factor (XII) and activation of the intrinsic cascade. Since venous thrombosis has occurred predominantly with malignant tumors that produce mucin, such as pancreatic carcinoma, it has been proposed that the release of mucinous substances from these tumors initiates DIC. Experimentally, mucin extracts have promoted clotting by activation of factor X (Stuart factor).[1](#core-r001) This effect is comparable to that of Russell viper venom or trypsin and, in contrast to activation by tissue thromboplastin, is independent of factor VII.In the case under discussion the diagnosis of DIC was first suggested clinically by the second occurrence of deep venous thrombosis after the anticoagulant was withdrawn. The laboratory criteria for this diagnosis were fulfilled since the results of two determinations (partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen level) indicated a consumption of clotting factors, and fibrinolysis was established by an elevated titer of fibrin degradation products. Although the history did not suggest pulmonary embolism, bilateral pleural effusions were apparent on physical examination and the roentgenograms of the chest. The aspirated pleural fluid did not contain tumor cells, and since the protein and LDH determinations indicated that the fluid was exudative bilateral pulmonary embolism can be assumed. The normal platelet count, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time provided evidencethat the DIC was in abeyance. The hematocrit of 30.3 per cent in the absence of recent blood loss and in the setting of DIC suggests a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Nevertheless, damaged red cells \u2014 i.e., helmet cells, schistocytes and red-cell fragments \u2014 were not described in the peripheral smear.Despite heparin therapy large to massive bilateral pulmonary embolism ensued and necessitated ligation of the inferior vena cava. The extraperitoneal approach must have been chosen, since the transabdominal route would have solved the major diagnostic problem promptly. Subsequently, diagnostic studies designed to uncover an intra-abdominal neoplasm were undertaken. Special attention was paid to the pancreas, the most common site of an occult cancer manifested by unexplained DIC. Radiologic contrast studies of the colon and urinary tract disclosed a pelvic mass, but vaginal examination and sonograms suggested no more than a uterus enlarged by leiomyomas.By the time of the second admission a pelvic tumor was obvious, and it had grown over a three-month period from an impalpable mass to one that was 15 cm in diameter. The urinary bladder deserves consideration as a possible source of this tumor. Hematuria was an assumed complication of anticoagulation at the other hospital, and proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were found on the second admission. In addition, the mass was palpable anterior to the uterus and could have been a leiomyoma. Although a cystoscopic examination would have resolved the question, the intravenous pyelograms showed only extrinsic pressure on the dome of the bladder, and subsequent events made that organ an improbable site of origin of the tumor. Since the barium-enema examination was negative and at least two stool specimens gave negative tests for occult blood I shall discard the diagnosis of cancer of the sigmoid colon. The initial sonographic study suggested an enlarged uterus, but the sonograms from the repeated study indicate that the suspicious image was in fact the mass in question. The absence of vaginal bleeding, the small size of the uterus (6 cm deep) and the endometrial-biopsy findings are sufficient to exclude uterine neoplasia. Nevertheless, the slightly atypical hyperplasia of the endometrium is consistent with a resurgence of estrogenic activity 10 years after the menopause, and that finding leads me to the diagnosis of a malignant ovarian neoplasm. One need not invoke the possibility of an estrogen-secreting tumor, however, since stimulation of the adjacent ovarian stroma by any number of benign and malignant ovarian tumors can induce androstenedione production, and this steroid can subsequently be converted peripherally to estrone.In addition to the associated DIC, the evidence favoring a malignant tumor includes elevation of the carcinoembryonic antigen above 5 ng per milliliter, a finding in 20 per cent of patients with ovarian carcinoma. The steeply rising alkaline phosphatase level appeared to parallel increments in tumor growth. Although a hepatic origin of the excess alkaline phosphatase was suggested by a parallel increase in the 5\u2032 nucleotidase level, the results of liver-function tests were normal, and ultimately a heat test of the alkaline phosphatase resulted in only 6 per cent inactivation. An alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme demonstrating such extreme heat stability is consistent with that of placental origin or the indistinguishable Regan isoenzyme, which is of tumor origin. Although not usually reflected in an elevation of the total serum alkaline phosphatase, the Regan isoenzyme has been identified in 53 per cent of patients with ovarian carcinoma. The similar rise in the 5\u2032 nucleotidase without apparent cause strongly suggests that this enzyme was also of tumor origin.Ovarian carcinoma complicated by DIC has attracted little attention in the medical literature. The association may be relatively common, however, and in one series of patients with ovarian carcinoma circulating fibrin degradation products were found in 72 per cent.[2](#core-r002) In their extensive review Sack and his associates[3](#core-r003) listed seven cases of ovarian cancer, which accounted for 3.8 per cent of their total number of cases and ranked this malignant tumor eighth as a cause of tumor-associated DIC.In the age group of the patient in question one of the neoplasms categorized under \"common epithelial tumors\" is most likely. The subgroups of carcinoma within this category, based on their consistent cell types, are, in order of frequency, serous cystadenocarcinoma, endometrioid carcinoma, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear-cell carcinoma and the rare malignant Brenner tumor. It is not possible to make the diagnosis of a specific cell type with any certainty, nor would this degree of specificity bear on the appropriate management. Nevertheless, in the spirit of this exercise I shall attempt to proceed further. Chronic DIC has not been identified with a specific neoplastic cell type, but it is tempting to select one that secretes mucin. I favor an endometrioid carcinoma because it can produce abundant mucin, and its solid consistence is compatible with the sonographic findings. Since the aspirated ascitic fluid did not contain tumor cells and no more than one mass was detected by sonography over a three-month period, I suspect that the tumor was localized to the ovary. In the presence of ascites and the reaccumulation of pleural fluid, predominantly on the right side, one is compelled to make a diagnosis of Meigs's syndrome. Since I believe that the tumor was malignant, however, the designation must be pseudo-Meigs's syndrome.I am somewhat bothered by the acute respiratory-tract symptoms that brought the patient to the hospital for the second admission. Except for the prolonged prothrombin time consistent with the warfarin therapy there was no evidence of DIC. Could a recurrence of pulmonary embolism have been responsible for the severe dyspnea and pleural effusions? Depending on the level of the vena-cava ligation, emboli could have originated from the ovarian veins or from a segment of the vena cava below the renal veins. Can the right side of the heart be implicated? The possibility of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis must be considered in all cases of chronic DIC. Twenty per cent of the 154 patients included in the collective review of Sack and his associates proved to have this additional complication at autopsy, and 85 per cent of those patients had experienced arterial embolism.[3](#core-r003) Thrombotic vegetations on the tricuspid valve could have been the source of pulmonary emboli in this case and might also explain the markedly elevated right atrial pressure noted during the first admission. On the other hand, murmurs were not described, and right-sided cardiac involvement has rarely been observed in the absence of left-sided involvement. It is conceivable that the hematuria and proteinuria were manifestations of emboli from valvular thrombi, but the evidence of arterial emboli is unconvincing, at best.A Physician: Would you consider the diagnosis of a metastatic tumor from the bowel in this case?Dr. Griffiths: I should have mentioned the possibility of a metastatic carcinoma, but the gastrointestinal tract was well studied and was an unlikely source.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Barnes, you followed this patient during the preoperative course. Will you comment?Dr. Ann B. Barnes: She was referred to the Hematology Service because of thrombophlebitis unresponsive to anticoagulant therapy. On the first admission I saw her only once, when I felt a slightly enlarged uterus. She was recovering from the vena-cava ligation and was still not adequately controlled on anticoagulation, and it didn't seem appropriate to do anything further at that time. She went home but subsequently returned to my office incredibly dyspneic, with tachycardia and tachypnea. The abdomen was markedly tense as a result of ascites. She was admitted and over the course of the next two weeks underwent repeated thoracenteses and paracenteses. We were unable to control the DIC, and diuretics were ineffective. There was evidence of rapid growth of the tumor from the ultrasound study. So after having implied that she was too sick to undergo an operation during the first admission, we had no choice but to explore her at that time, even though she was far sicker.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Barnes: Since the endometrial-biopsy specimen obtained on the first admission was no more than slightly atypical and the uterus was of normal size, it seemed probable that the tumor was adnexal. At operation there was more than a liter of ascitic fluid. The right ovary was replaced by a large mass that was adherent to the uterus and the right pelvic wall. Because of difficulty in achieving hemostasis we decided to perform a right salpingo-oophorectomy, a supracervical hysterectomy and an omentectomy. During the immediate postoperative period the DIC was still present. Fluid reaccumulated, and she continued to have cardiac problems.Dr. Stanley J. Robboy: The ovarian tumor was a 12.5-cm, predominantly solid, only partly encapsulated mass. Microscopical examination revealed a Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma ([Fig. 2](#f002)), a type of common epithelial tumor that resembles adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. Substantial portions of the tumor were hemorrhagic or necrotic.It has been recognized for some time that Trousseau's syndrome, which is characterized clinically by migratory thrombophlebitis in patients with malignant neoplasms, is a manifestation of low-grade chronic DIC.[3,4](#core-r003) It has also been suspected that sub-clinical DIC has been associated with a variety of cancers. In at least two surveys of patients with cancer and overt hematologic abnormalities nine[5](#core-r005) and 48 per cent[6](#core-r006) had a coagulation disorder. Although clinically evident DIC is rare in patients with ovarian tumors,[3,7\u20139](#core-r003) laboratory evidence of this disorder is common. In the series of 32 patients with ovarian cancer studied by \u00c5stedt et al.[2](#core-r002) 72 per cent had an elevated level of fibrin degradation products, ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg per 100 ml. In contrast, only 4 per cent of 131 patients with benign conditions had an elevated level, and the highest level was only 2 mg per 100 ml. Several years later these workers investigated 19 patients with ovarian carcinoma and ascites.[10](#core-r010) In the ascitic fluid the fibrin degradation products were as high as 190 mg per 100 ml, suggesting that in this form of cancer extravascular coagulation occurs in the peritoneal cavity, followed by extravascular lysis of the clots and seepage of the breakdown products back into the bloodstream. Several years ago we did a prospective study of 45 patients in whom DIC developed while they were in this hospital.[11\u201313](#core-r011) Although bleeding into the skin was the most common clinical manifestation,[14](#core-r014) bleeding from a bodily orifice was the first indication of the disorder in some cases. Even diffuse bleeding into the lungs occurred fairly frequently.[13](#core-r013) One of the rarest presenting signs was thrombophlebitis. On the basis of these studies we postulated that at least three major mechanisms can trigger DIC[15](#core-r015): damage to endothelial cells with exposure of the underlying collagen, leading to activation of factor XII and finally activation of the intrinsic process of coagulation; necrosis of the cancer cells with release of thromboplastin, resulting in activation of the extrinsic system of coagulation; and the breakdown of platelets, with release of phospholipids and activation of the coagulation system. All three mechanisms converge through a common pathway \u2014namely, the formation of thrombin and transformation of fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and clots. Another key feature of the syndrome that is not generally appreciated is simultaneous activation of the plasminogen system by the thrombin. This system is a physiologic compensatory mechanism designed to dissolve clots that have formed. If plasmin were not formed and clots were not lysed every patient would die of widespread occlusive clots. Plasmin cleaves fibrin clots into fibrin degradation products. Thus, the measurement of the degradation products is simply a reflection of the severity of the DIC.Dr. Scully: Was there any mucin in the tumor?Dr. Robboy: Although mucin was present, I am not convinced that it was the specific factor that activated the DIC. Prostatic carcinomas and acute promyelocytic leukemia, which do no secrete mucin, may also be associated with DIC and fibrinolysis.Dr. Scully: This patient has very interesting follow-up findings.Dr. Barnes: Since she had residual tumor in the pelvis after the operation and was too sick for extensive chemotherapy we decided to give her progestin therapy, first in the form of 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone-17-n-caproate (Delalutin), administered intramuscularly, and later in the form of megestrol acetate, an oral progestin. We thought that this therapy would not harm her, and that it might help. She improved progressively and went home two months after the operation.Dr. George S. Richardson: One point that we should establish is whether she had an objective response to progestin therapy, since I believe that there have been very few reports of endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary responding to that treatment. I've always been surprised by that observation since the tumor resembles carcinoma of the endometrium in its histologic features.Dr. Robboy: It will be difficult to establish with certainty whether the patient responded to the progestins. She had a stormy postoperative course. At the time of the operation the platelet count was 95,000. The titer of fibrin degradation products, which had been at 1:512 nine days preoperatively, had fallen to 1:128 by the time of the operation and stabilized at 1:32 during the first postoperative week. The platelet count also remained stable for a week. Then, *Klebsiella pneumoniae* septicemia occurred, and the platelet count suddenly plunged from 180,000 to 32,000. Twelve days postoperatively she began to receive 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone-17-n-caproate. During the ensuing week the platelet count rose to 350,000, and the titer of fibrin degradation products remained at 1:32, suggesting that with most of the tumor gone and the klebsiella septicemia subsiding she was already on the road to recovery and would probably have shown a response regardless of what drug she received. After the megestrol acetate was begun the platelet count stayed at its elevated level of above 500,000, and the titer of fibrin degradation products plateaued at 1:16. Thus, it is very difficult to determine whether she was already getting better, or whether the improvement was due to the progestin therapy. Dr. Zareh Demirjian, the hematologic consultant on this case, believed that the dramatic clinical response occurred just after the progestin therapy was begun, and that it was responsible for the clinical change.Dr. Griffiths: Was there a response of the alkaline phosphatase level?Dr. Robboy: It was 56 Bodansky U before the operation, 8 Bodansky U one week later, and 20 Bodansky U at the time of discharge.Dr. Barnes: She returned for a follow-up examination after three months in an excellent condition, able to do some housework and regaining her strength. She had very little ascites at that time.Dr. Robboy: She remained relatively well until eight months after the operation, when she had an episode of acute abdominal pain and weakness with a falling hematocrit, a rising alkaline phosphatase level and an exacerbation of the DIC. She was admitted to the hospital and treated conservatively. About six weeks later she returned once again with a stroke and died a few weeks later. The autopsy disclosed extensive necrotic tumor in the pelvis with adhesions to the mesentery and serosa of the large bowel. Numerous small, friable, nonbacterial vegetations were present on the mitral valve. The brain was the site of several recent infarcts, and an embolus was found in the left vertebral artery. Numerous recent infarcts were also present in the kidneys. There were multiple bilateral healed pulmonary infarcts.\n",

      "question": "A 21-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of thoracolumbar pain.\nThe patient had been well until 17 weeks earlier, when she began to have pain in the midline thoracolumbar region of the spine, with radiation to the right flank, accompanied by nocturnal fever. The pain was aggravated by coughing, sneezing, straining, and recumbency and was not relieved by acetaminophen.\nFourteen weeks before admission she came to this hospital. Her temperature was 38\u00b0C. The physical examination was normal except for tenderness in the right costovertebral angle and a narrow introitus that prevented a digital examination. The urine was normal, except that the sediment contained 4 red cells per high-power field, 8 white cells per high-power field, and moderate numbers of bacteria per high-power field. The hematocrit was 36.4 percent; the white-cell count was 5500 per cubic millimeter, with 71 percent neutrophils, 20 percent lymphocytes, 8 percent monocytes, and 1 percent eosinophils. A urine culture yielded abundant lactobacilli. The urea nitrogen concentration was 5 mg per deciliter (2 mmol per liter). The values for creatinine, glucose, conjugated and total bilirubin, electrolytes, amylase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, and a test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative.\nRadiographs of the chest and abdomen were normal. An ultrasonographic examination of the upper portion of the abdomen showed a normal appearance of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and kidneys. Radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine were normal. The patient had undergone pharaonic circumcision at the age of five years, with amputation of the cervix and nearly complete obliteration of the vaginal orifice. An antibiotic agent and a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug were prescribed, and the patient's condition improved for a time.\nThree weeks before admission the pain worsened; it was exacerbated by walking, sneezing, and laughing and was accompanied by nocturnal fever. The patient returned to this hospital. The physical examination, including a neurologic examination, was unremarkable. The hematocrit was 37.6 percent, the white-cell count was 5000 per cubic millimeter, the platelet count was 358,000 per cubic millimeter, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 56 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen concentration was 5 mg per deciliter, and the total protein concentration was 8.1 g per deciliter (albumin, 3.4; globulin, 4.7). The values for uric acid, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, amylase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal.\nRadiographs of the thoracolumbar spine (\nFigure 1\n) showed an osteolytic lesion in the proximal right 11th rib, which was confirmed on coned views; that rib did not articulate normally, in contrast to the left 11th rib. There was no evidence of intervertebral disk disease. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the lower thoracic spine (\nFigure 2\n) showed a soft-tissue mass to the right of T11, which extended into the neural foramina and involved the proximal portion of the right 11th rib. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the thoracolumbar spine, obtained before and after the administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine (\nFigure 3\n), showed a right-sided paravertebral soft-tissue mass extending from the inferior aspect of T10 to the superior aspect of T12. The mass had the same signal intensity as muscle on T\n1\n-weighted images and was hyperintense on T\n2\n-weighted images, with heterogeneous enhancement. The lesion extended into the T11 neural foramina and abutted the right T11 nerve root. There was erosion of the T11 posterior elements, the right lateral portion of the T11 vertebral body, and the proximal portion of the 11th rib. A left-sided paravertebral mass with similar signal characteristics extended from the inferior aspect of T8 to the superior aspect of T10, entered the T9 neural foramina, and obliterated the T9 nerve root, causing erosion of the posterior elements of T9 and the inferior portion of the posterior elements of T8. A cranial MRI examination was normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nShe was a native of a country on the northeastern coast of Africa and had immigrated to the United States two years before admission. Her general health had always been good except for a bout of hepatitis at the age of seven years. She did not drink or smoke; her menses were normal, and she had never been sexually active. There was no history of urinary incontinence or retention, cough, hemoptysis, diarrhea, heart murmur, serious infections, receipt of blood products, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to pets, or weakness in the legs.\nThe temperature was 37\u00b0C, the pulse was 72, and the respirations were 16. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\nOn physical examination the patient appeared well. No rash or lymphadenopathy was found. The head, neck, lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. An abdominal examination was normal; no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly was detected. No scoliosis or kyphosis was observed; there was tenderness over the vertebral spines from approximately the fifth thoracic to the second lumbar vertebra and in the right costovertebral angle, with less tenderness on the left side. The extremities were normal. A neurologic examination, including an assessment of motor power, sensation, and reflexes in the lower extremities, was normal.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 35.2 percent, the white-cell count was 4800 per cubic millimeter, the platelet count was 352,000 per cubic millimeter, and the mean corpuscular volume was 98 \u03bcm\n3\n. The values for urea nitrogen, creatinine, conjugated and total bilirubin, electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. A chest film was normal.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Henry J. Mankin[\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic imaging studies?Dr. Edward B. Marianacci: A coned-down view of the lower thoracic spine ([Figure 1](#f01)) shows a destructive lesion in the proximal right T11 rib. The vertebral body appears intact. A CT scan ([Figure 2](#f02)) through the same level shows an expansion of the proximal portion of the right 11th rib, with bony destruction. Bony destruction is also evident along the adjacent lateral aspect of the 11th vertebral body, surrounded by an ill-defined soft-tissue mass centered at the costovertebral articulation. An axial image at the T9 level shows bony destruction along the left lateral aspect of the vertebral body and the proximal portion of the left ninth rib, with an associated, ill-defined soft-tissue mass. An axial T1-weighted MRI scan ([Figure 3](#f03)) through the T11 level shows a soft-tissue mass in the region of the proximal right 11th rib that has predominantly the same signal intensity as muscle. A gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image shows heterogeneous enhancement of the mass, as well as an adjacent area within the vertebral body. A chest film obtained on admission was normal.Dr. Mankin: If any laboratory tests for infectious diseases had been performed, particularly a tuberculin test, but also blood cultures and blood tests for some of the rarer fungal infections, the results would have been helpful in the differential diagnosis. I assume that these tests were not done.The features of this case that are important to consider in arriving at the appropriate diagnosis include the anatomical sites of the lesions, the patient's country of origin, and the nature of the illness. I shall address each in turn.First, there were two lesions in distinct anatomical sites, both of which arose in the paravertebral space. The lower lesion on the right side had displaced a rib, destroyed its head, and entered the canal through the foramen without causing much damage to the vertebral body. The lesion on the left side had entered the spinal canal but had a smaller soft-tissue component. The only bone disease was in the rib and on the surface of the vertebrae, and it is therefore unlikely that the bone was the principal site of the disease. The process probably arose in the soft tissue, the paravertebral space, or even the spinal canal.Second, the patient came from the northeastern coast of Africa, and I assume that she was black. I base this assumption principally on the history of clitoral circumcision, which is performed by a number of black African tribes, mostly in Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, although Kenya is considered to be in central rather than northern Africa.[1\u20133](#core-r001) It is important at this point to rule out the clitoral circumcision as the cause of the presenting symptoms. Although gynecologic abnormalities and urinary tract and soft-tissue infections have been reported in association with this practice, none of these disorders are consistent with this patient's presentation.Somalia, Sudan, and Ethiopia are currently considered to be major reservoirs for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In addition, some disorders that are rarely seen in the United States are prevalent in these countries, including leishmaniasis, kala-azar, schistosomiasis, trypanosomiasis, toxoplasmosis, sporotrichosis, cryptococcosis, yaws, and bejel.[4,5](#core-r004) Few of these diseases present as isolated granulomatous abscesses of the spine, however, and I can put them at the bottom of the diagnostic list, although I shall return to one of them during my final analysis.Third, this patient's illness seems to have been infectious and, in view of changes shown on the imaging studies, probably granulomatous. The febrile course, with a daily rise of the temperature to 38\u00b0C, and the rapid sedimentation rate support this conclusion. Lymphoma, the only other disease commonly associated with fever of this sort in young adults, is a possible explanation, although the absence of palpable lymph nodes, the absence of organomegaly on the abdominal ultrasonographic study, and the peculiar shape and character of the lesions make lymphoma less probable than infection. An even less likely diagnosis is neurofibromatosis, with two dumbbell-shaped destructive soft-tissue lesions (both inside and outside the spinal canal), but this diagnosis is improbable in the absence of axillary freckling, fibroma molluscum of the skin, or plexiform neurofibromas at other sites. The destruction of the rib makes a neurofibroma improbable. The patient was too young for metastatic carcinoma, and the presence of two distinct lesions makes the diagnosis of a primary malignant bone or soft-tissue neoplasm unlikely. Having said that, I must mention that Ewing's sarcoma can be multicentric and can arise from the ribs and soft tissue of the paravertebral space. Two separate foci of Ewing's sarcoma are much less likely, however, than two foci of granulomatous infection.What kind of infection could this patient have had? It could have been an unusual type indigenous to the northeastern coast of Africa. Sporotrichosis, cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis are three such infections that in their disseminated form may produce bone lesions and soft-tissue abscesses.[6,7](#core-r006) The absence of skin lesions, pulmonary abnormalities, hepatomegaly, and a variety of other changes in the nervous and gastrointestinal systems, however, makes any of these diseases an unlikely cause of this patient's illness.Of the granulomatous processes, the most prevalent worldwide is tuberculosis. This disease has reached epidemic proportions in some parts of the world, and a third of the world's population is infected with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* [8](#core-r008) (known as the \u201cRed King\u201d). The form of tuberculosis that affects the musculoskeletal system in urban populations in this country was until recently almost always secondary disease (reinfection) and principally involved the joints and the spine. Tuberculous osteomyelitis, soft-tissue abscesses, and miliary disease in the bone marrow were seen principally in Eskimos and native Americans and have become rare even in these populations. With the advent of AIDS, however, the Red King has returned to the cities in this country, with not only a wide array of new presentations but also resistance to many of the medications that were previously so effective in treating the disease.[9\u201311](#core-r009) The frequency of tuberculosis in New York City and San Francisco is increasing rapidly, and these cities are on the brink of having epidemics.[9,10](#core-r009)Tuberculosis affecting the spine has a long history in orthopedics and was one of the most common diseases encountered in the early days of the specialty. At the turn of the century and later, patients with chronic musculoskeletal problems associated with tuberculosis, chronic osteomyelitis, anterior poliomyelitis, or the sequelae of acquired or congenital syphilis filled the orthopedic wards, and these diseases caused severe disability. The typical presentation of spinal tuberculosis was an initial destructive lesion in the subchondral region of the body of a lumbar segment (or less commonly, a thoracic segment, or even less frequently, a cervical segment) that extended beneath the anterior longitudinal ligament to the adjacent segment, producing a similar lesion in that bone. This disorder resulted in the characteristic picture of Pott's disease: subcortical and cortical destruction on both sides of a narrowed but usually not completely collapsed disk space, a juxtaarticular osteopenia, and a soft-tissue (cold) abscess that tracked with the psoas muscle, either along or directly posterior to the ribs. Less commonly, sufficient granulomatous material and pus accumulated in the epidural space to produce neurologic changes, a process that became known as \u201cPott's paraplegia.\u201d This lesion requires early drainage to prevent permanent damage to the spinal cord, cauda equina, and nerve roots.Since the advent of antituberculous drugs, the frequency of these two characteristic presentations of spinal disease has declined. Use of antituberculous drugs has also virtually eliminated the severe distortion of the spinal segment occurring late in the course of the disorder, which often produced a deforming gibbus or severely fixed scoliosis and pelvic obliquity in the early days, when the Red King predominated among orthopedic diseases.The picture in Third World countries was and still is considerably different. In the days before effective drug treatment was available, many patients had the primary disease, with dissemination to the meninges, peritoneum, bone marrow, skin, and lymph nodes, and they often died of the disease. Tuberculosis remains a serious health problem in Africa. In Somalia the rate of positive tuberculin tests is estimated to be 54 percent in persons 15 years of age.[12](#core-r012) A case report from Toronto described an Ethiopian man who presented with mild constitutional symptoms, bony tenderness of the chest wall, and rib erosions, with a normal chest film and normal sputum studies. He was evaluated for lymphoma and ultimately was given the diagnosis of tuberculosis.[13](#core-r013) Similarly, although Pott's disease is the characteristic form of spinal tuberculosis,[14,15](#core-r014) in recent years, particularly among the African populations, there have been reports of paraspinal abscesses and skip lesions with little or no effect on the adjacent vertebral bodies.[16](#core-r016) Tuberculosis of the spine affecting only the posterior elements and pedicles has also been described.[17](#core-r017)In view of the prevalence of tuberculosis in Somalia and Ethiopia and the recent discovery, particularly with the use of modern imaging techniques, that tuberculous granulomas can present as paravertebral or epidural abscesses, which can even destroy a rib,[18](#core-r018) it is logical to conclude that this patient had a tuberculous infection. The principal question is whether tuberculosis can cause such extensive spinal disease without some pulmonary, renal, or gastrointestinal abnormalities or lymphadenopathy. Such a presentation is possible, as the recent case report by Hanania and Hoffstein indicates,[13](#core-r013) but it is unlikely in view of the typical presentation of reinfection with hematogenous spread to the spine from an active pulmonary focus.Before making an unequivocal diagnosis, I shall discuss one other possible diagnosis: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Primary lymphoma of bone is not uncommon, and the spine and even the ribs are not unusual sites.[19,20](#core-r019) Multiple foci are the rule. Although nocturnal fever (in the form of Pel\u2013Ebstein fever) is more characteristic of Hodgkin's disease, it can also occur with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and may be the symptom heralding the disorder. The sedimentation rate is often elevated in patients with lymphoma; the white-cell count and the rest of the studies generally provide little help in making the diagnosis. Although lymphadenopathy and organomegaly may be present in such patients, these findings are not the rule, especially in patients with a primary lymphoma of bone. The findings in this case could be those of lymphoma, probably arising in the 11th rib, with a second focus in the paravertebral tissues two segments cephalad to the presenting site.As for fungal and other disorders possibly related to the patient's African background, it is improbable that cryptococcosis or histoplasmosis would cause so much destruction and such a well-defined soft-tissue abscess without involvement of the lungs, central nervous system, viscera, and skin and without a much less indolent course. Sporotrichosis is a more likely possibility, since it is associated with pulmonary or visceral disorders less often, and osteomyelitis and central nervous system involvement are not uncommon.In the final analysis, then, I must include the possibilities of sporotrichosis, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and tuberculosis. None of these diagnoses are consistent with all the historical, physical, imaging, and laboratory data in this case, and I am tempted to list lymphoma and sporotrichosis just to learn more about them, but as an orthopedist, I remain drawn to the Red King, which has so dramatically changed the world and remains a predominant medical problem. A paravertebral and epidural abscess with *M. tuberculosis* is therefore my diagnosis in this case.Dr. Mandel E. Cohen: Was there a family history of tuberculosis?Dr. Eugene J. Mark: No family history of tuberculosis is indicated in the case record.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Horace C. Wu: The diagnostic procedure was a fine-needle aspiration, which revealed scanty chronic inflammation, epithelioid cells, giant cells, and necrotic material ([Figure 4](#f04)). A Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain for acid-fast organisms was negative on the cell-block preparation. Fluorescence microscopy with the use of auramine O showed rare acid-fast organisms, however, and cultures of the specimen were positive for *M. tuberculosis,* which was sensitive to ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifampin, and streptomycin.The infectious agent was identified by a specific method of acid-fast staining that involves the use of a fluorochrome, such as auramine O, which has a bright-yellow fluorescence. Most investigators believe that this technique is more sensitive than bright-field microscopy, which is the more common method of examination. Although the equipment for fluorescence microscopy with acid-fast staining is more expensive and requires greater expertise to use, many experienced pathologists report that it is superior and should be used when possible.It is generally believed that skeletal tuberculosis is caused by the dissemination of bacilli in the bloodstream early in the course of the initial infection.[21\u201324](#core-r021) In some cases the infection appears to spread to bone through lymphatic drainage from another focus of tuberculosis. Infection in the pleura or kidneys may spread through the paraaortic lymph nodes, with erosion of the vertebral column. In children and probably also in adults, skeletal involvement may be the only manifestation of systemic disease and, like the pulmonary form, may smolder for years before being recognized.[24](#core-r024)Although skeletal involvement is present in only about 1 percent of cases of tuberculosis, it is the most common site of extrapulmonary disease, accounting for 35 percent of such cases.[25](#core-r025) In adults tuberculosis of the skeletal system usually occurs in the joints most subject to trauma. Spinal involvement accounts for approximately half the cases, and involvement of the hip and the knee accounts for about 15 percent of them.[21](#core-r021) Tuberculosis of bone is more common in elderly patients than in those who are younger and is apt to have an unusual location.The first lumbar vertebra is the most frequently affected.[21,24](#core-r021) Although solitary lesions are not uncommon, multiple lesions, ranging in number up to 10, are typical.[21,24,26](#core-r021) The vertebral body is affected more often than the posterior elements, although the latter are initially or predominantly affected in some patients.In most cases, tuberculous spondylitis begins in the anterior portion of the vertebral body adjacent to the subchondral plate. Enlargement and caseation of the lesion lead to an identifiable radiographic abnormality in two to five months.[21,25](#core-r021) During this time, infection may spread to the adjacent intervertebral disks if the bacilli extend beneath the anterior or posterior longitudinal ligament and involve the peripheral disk tissue. The collapse of partially destroyed vertebral bodies can lead to severe deformities, such as a kyphosis or a gibbous deformity.[21,25,27](#core-r021)Tuberculosis frequently extends from the vertebrae and disks to the adjacent ligaments and soft tissue. The extension is usually anterolateral and only rarely posterior in the peridural space.[28,29](#core-r028) After infection has been established in the perispinal tissue, it may remain localized or extend for a considerable distance. Abscess formation can produce soft-tissue swelling, which is commonly bilateral and fusiform and may contain foci of calcification.With a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, the morphologic and microbiologic diagnosis of vertebral tuberculosis can be made with confidence, and conservative medical treatment should be initiated as early as possible.[30\u201333](#core-r030) The hazards of an open biopsy of a malignant tumor, which can mimic tuberculous spondylitis radiographically, are avoided with this procedure. In the hands of a trained cytopathologist, fine-needle aspiration is not hazardous, and it results in fewer complications and costs less than an open biopsy.[30](#core-r030)Dr. Mark: The patient was in the hospital for three days, during which time antibacterial therapy was started and she was fitted for a back brace. She was discharged to be cared for at home.Dr. Robert B. Colvin: Dr. Mankin, will you comment on the treatment of this disease?Dr. Mankin: In the past a surgical approach was the only option, but drugs such as isoniazid, rifampin, and streptomycin are now used to treat the disease in the absence of paraplegia. When Pott's paraplegia develops, we often need to perform a decompression to avoid permanent damage.\n\nAddendum\n--------\n\nDr. Howard M. Heller: The organism was susceptible to all the drugs that were tested, but rifampin had to be discontinued because of the development of a generalized rash, and ofloxacin and pyrazinamide were stopped because of severe arthralgia. The patient has continued to take isoniazid and ethambutol. At her last visit, seven months after treatment had been instituted, she was well. Her back pain had resolved almost completely, and she had no neurologic deficits.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Jonathan Reisman\n(Internal Medicine): A 77-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of leg edema, hematuria, and acute renal failure.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and an aortic aneurysm. He had been in his usual health until approximately 1 month before admission, when bilateral lower-leg edema developed, followed by a red rash on the feet. He saw his physician, who noted worsening hypertension; the patient's antihypertensive medications were changed, including discontinuation of amlodipine, a short trial of atenolol (which caused increased shortness of breath and wheezing), and initiation of diltiazem, without improvement in blood-pressure control and peripheral edema. Twenty days before admission, he saw his cardiologist and reported leg swelling and dyspnea. On examination, the blood pressure was 156/90 mm Hg and the pulse 70 beats per minute (irregularly irregular rhythm), with 3+ lower-leg edema. Diltiazem was stopped, and chlorthalidone begun. At a follow-up visit 5 days later, the patient reported slight improvement in dyspnea, his weight had decreased 3.6 kg, and the blood pressure was 146/80 mm Hg. The blood urea nitrogen level was 34 mg per deciliter (12.1 mmol per liter) (reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), and the creatinine, which reportedly had been 1.4 mg per deciliter (123.8 \u03bcmol per liter) the previous year, was 2.7 mg per deciliter (238.7 \u03bcmol per liter) (reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53.0 to 132.6 \u03bcmol per liter]). Chlorthalidone and lisinopril were stopped, and follow-up was scheduled. Medications also included aspirin (81 mg), terazosin, and a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen.\nDuring the next week, subjective fevers and shaking chills developed; chest tightness occurred occasionally, but dyspnea on exertion lessened. Six days before this admission, two episodes of vomiting, with nonbilious emesis, and one episode of hemoptysis occurred. The urine appeared dark red. The next day, the patient went to the emergency department at another hospital. On examination, the height was 170 cm, the weight 72.1 kg, the blood pressure 141/85 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute and irregular, the temperature 36.7\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were fine crackles at the base of the left lung and a papular rash on the legs, without pretibial edema; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of total protein, phosphorus, magnesium, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, amylase, lipase, uric acid, IgA, IgG, and complement (C3 and C4) were normal, as were tests of coagulation and liver function. Testing was negative for antibodies to glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), including those with a cytoplasmic pattern of staining (c-ANCA, antibodies to serine proteinase 3) and those with a perinuclear pattern of staining (p-ANCA, antibodies to myeloperoxidase); other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Specimens of urine and blood were cultured, and intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone were administered. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nRenal ultrasonography reportedly showed an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 8 cm. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, without the administration of contrast material, reportedly showed a circumferential fusiform aneurysm (8.3 cm) of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and another aneurysm (2 cm) in the right iliac artery. Terazosin,\nLactobacillus acidophilus,\nheparin, clonidine, omeprazole, ferrous sulfate, nifedipine, and a polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine were administered. The blood level of creatinine rose daily. On the third day, testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative, and no monoclonal immunoglobulin was detected; other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. On the second, third, and fourth hospital days, methylprednisolone (500 mg daily) was administered. On the third day, insulin was added. A unit of leukocyte-poor packed red cells was transfused. On the fifth hospital day, blood cultures drawn on admission remained sterile. A renal biopsy was performed. The next afternoon, pathological examination of the biopsy tissue revealed mild proliferative glomerulonephritis with crescents, segmental nodular glomerulosclerosis, diffuse linear immunofluorescence reactivity for IgG along the GBM, and signs of active and healed mesangiolysis, moderate tubular atrophy, and widespread endothelial-cell injury. The patient was transferred to this hospital.\nThe patient had a history of intermittent hemoptysis during the previous 5 years and reported no recent headache, changes in vision, malaise, fatigue, chest or abdominal pain, or diarrhea. He had hypertension, atrial fibrillation (for which he had declined anticoagulation therapy), hepatic and renal cysts, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and an aneurysm (4.3 cm by 4.4 cm) of the ascending thoracic aorta as revealed by CT imaging 2 years earlier. He had had orthopedic surgery, an appendectomy, and a deep venous thrombosis that was treated with heparin. He was married, had children, and was retired from the construction industry. He was a current cigarette smoker (55 pack-years), drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. His father died at 58 years of age of myocardial infarction, his mother died at 67 years of age of breast cancer, a daughter had breast cancer, and two children had diabetes mellitus.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg and the pulse 85 beats per minute and irregular; the temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. He had faint crackles in both lungs, 3+ pitting edema to the knees, and a nonpalpable, pink, blanching macular rash on both medial malleoli; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of protein, albumin, globulin, phosphorus, and magnesium were normal, as were tests of coagulation and liver function; other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. A chest radiograph showed focal, patchy opacification in the right lower lobe.\nDiagnostic test results were received, and management decisions were made.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Hasan Bazari:* May we review the imaging studies?*Dr. Alexander R. Guimaraes:* The initial chest radiograph ([Figure 1A](#f01)) showed increased reticulonodular opacities at both lung bases, more on the left lung than on the right lung. A high-resolution CT scan of the chest ([Figure 1B and 1C](#f01)) showed centrilobular emphysema at the apexes of the lungs; at the bases, where the crackles were heard, there were small reticular opacities without gross consolidation ([Figure 1C](#f01)). Ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening (in a \u201ccrazy paving\u201d pattern), which are considered suggestive of pulmonary hemorrhage, were not seen. A CT scan of the abdomen without intravenous contrast material ([Figure 1D and 1E](#f01)) showed a heavily calcified aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta that measured approximately 8 cm in maximal cross-sectional diameter.*Dr. Bazari:* I am aware of the diagnosis in this case. This 77-year-old man presented with progressive renal failure, leg edema, and hemoptysis. He meets the criteria for the syndrome known as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, which is defined as a loss of renal function of at least 50% in less than 3 months and evidence of glomerular injury, with hematuria and proteinuria.[1](#core-r001) The hematuria is of upper tract origin, with dysmorphic red cells and often red-cell casts in the sediment. The pathological correlate of the clinical syndrome of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is crescentic glomerulonephritis, in which crescents are formed by extracapillary proliferation of epithelial cells and more than 50% of the glomeruli are affected.[2](#core-r002)\n### Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis\n\nRapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is caused by three major categories of disease: anti-GBM disease (in approximately 10% of cases), pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (in approximately 60%), and immune-complex glomerulonephritis (in approximately 30%). The clinician will need to decide on the risks and benefits of empirical therapy with immunosuppression while the evaluation is in progress. Our patient was empirically treated with glucocorticoids because of the results of the urinalysis and the presence of dysmorphic red cells in the sediment.\n### Goodpasture's Syndrome\n\nThis patient had a history of intermittent hemoptysis and was a smoker. Ernest Goodpasture described two cases of pulmonary hemorrhage with systemic vasculitis in 1918, which he ascribed to the influenza epidemic.[3](#core-r003) Goodpasture's syndrome was later shown to be due to autoantibodies to the noncollagenous 1 (NC1) domain of type IV collagen in the GBM.[4,5](#core-r004) Patients with Goodpasture's syndrome (also known as anti-GBM disease) often present with the abrupt onset of oliguria, hematuria, and acute renal failure, as this patient did.[6](#core-r006) The age distribution is bimodal \u2014 young men who smoke present with a pulmonary\u2013renal syndrome, and women in their sixth and seventh decades present with disease limited to the kidney.[7](#core-r007) Lung involvement occurs in patients who smoke, such as this patient, presumably because of lung injury and the exposure of new epitopes to the immune system. Diagnosis is made by the detection of the antibody in the blood and of the deposition of IgG on the GBM on biopsy.This patient could have anti-GBM disease, on the basis of acute glomerulonephritis and the history of hemoptysis. However, the test for anti-GBM antibody was negative.\n### Pauci-Immune Glomerulonephritides\n\nThe more common causes of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis are the pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritides, including the ANCA-associated vasculitides \u2014 microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener's granulomatosis), and the Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome. Microscopic polyangiitis is a vasculitis of the small and medium vessels[8](#core-r008) that typically is manifested by prolonged constitutional symptoms,[9](#core-r009) with renal involvement in 80% of patients[10](#core-r010) and pulmonary involvement in 20 to 55% of patients.[11](#core-r011) Mononeuritis multiplex and cutaneous lesions occur less frequently.[12](#core-r012) Patients present with hematuria with or without proteinuria, occasionally in the nephrotic range, and 10 to 46% require dialysis.[9,10,12](#core-r009) Circulating ANCA directed against myeloperoxidase (p-ANCA) are found in 50 to 75% of patients.[10,13,14](#core-r010) The positive predictive value of the test for ANCA for a diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis in patients with active renal disease ranges from 47 to 99%.[15](#core-r015)Granulomatosis with polyangiitis typically involves the upper and lower respiratory tracts and is associated with glomerulonephritis. The disease can be indolent, with involvement of the sinuses (chronic sinusitis), the ears (otitis media), and the trachea (tracheal stenosis),[16](#core-r016) before the onset of systemic vasculitis. The disease mostly affects white men and women in the fifth decade.[17,18](#core-r017) Most patients have upper-airway or lung involvement, which varies from nodules that cavitate to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Eye disease occurs in one third to one half of patients. Skin involvement can include a vasculitic rash and nonhealing ulcers. This patient had hemoptysis and a rash but no upper airway disease. Most patients have a positive test for ANCA directed against proteinase 3, with the immunofluorescence staining in a cytoplasmic distribution (c-ANCA).[19](#core-r019) The ANCA tests have a sensitivity up to 90% and a specificity up to 98%. In this case, the negative ANCA test argues against the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis but does not rule it out.The third ANCA-associated disease is Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome, characterized by asthma, eosinophilia, granulomatous vasculitis, and tissue eosinophilic infiltration.[20\u201322](#core-r020) It occurs in patients in their 30s and 40s, unlike this patient, with a slight male predominance. The renal involvement is typically mild, unlike in this case.[23](#core-r023) ANCA directed against myeloperoxidase (p-ANCA) can be detected in 65% of patients. Eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels are characteristic features. Our patient did not have any asthma or eosinophilia, making the Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome unlikely.\n### Immune-Complex Glomerulonephritides\n\nThe immune-complex glomerulonephritides that need to be considered include the hypocomplementemic and normocomplementemic groups. Disorders associated with low C3 levels include systemic lupus erythematosus, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, endocarditis, visceral abscesses, and shunt nephritis. The major disorder associated with low C4 levels is cryoglobulinemia. Normocomplementemic glomerulonephritides include mainly IgA nephropathy, Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, and fibrillary glomerulonephritis.Postinfectious glomerulonephritis occurs after an upper respiratory tract infection or skin infection.[24,25](#core-r024) There was no preceding infection to explain this patient's disease. An immune complex glomerulonephritis caused by endocarditis was much more common in the pre-antibiotic era than it is now.[26\u201329](#core-r026) We have seen cases of Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura triggered by infection with bacteria, including *Staphylococcus aureus*.[30](#core-r030) In this patient, there was no evidence of infection or sepsis.Cryoglobulinemia of any of the three types (type I, monoclonal; type II, monoclonal plus polyclonal; and type III, polyclonal)[31](#core-r031) involves the skin, with petechial rash, livedo reticularis, ulceration, and digital ischemia. Other manifestations include arthritis, central nervous system involvement, cardiac involvement, gastrointestinal vasculitis, and pulmonary involvement. This patient had a rash and renal disease, raising the possibility of cryoglobulinemia. However, he had no risk factors for and no clinical manifestations of an infection, such as hepatitis C,[32,33](#core-r032) or a clonal or malignant hematologic disorder, which is typically associated with cryoglobulinemia.Systemic lupus erythematosus is most often manifested in young women but can also occur in the elderly and in men. The manifestations include skin, joint, serosal, gastrointestinal, renal, psychiatric, pulmonary, and hematologic manifestations. The symptoms in patients with lupus nephritis can range from none to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. This elderly male patient had none of the classic features of systemic lupus erythematosus.IgA nephropathy and Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura are IgA-deposition diseases that cause glomerulonephritis. IgA nephropathy[34](#core-r034) is the most common cause of glomerulonephritis, and symptoms range from asymptomatic hematuria to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.[35](#core-r035) Proteinuria, hypertension, older age, male sex, black race, and the presence of scarring and crescents on examination of a renal-biopsy specimen are all associated with a poor prognosis in patients with IgA nephropathy.[36](#core-r036) Patients with Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura and renal disease have palpable purpura and gastrointestinal manifestations, including abdominal pain, bleeding, infarction, and intussusceptions.[37](#core-r037) This patient with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and a rash could have an IgA-mediated process; however, the renal-biopsy specimen did not show IgA deposition.\n### Summary\n\nIn a patient with rapidly progressive renal failure, the finding of red-cell casts allows for a clinical classification of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. We can perform a sequential serologic evaluation ([Figure 2](#f02)), but the pattern of organ involvement may help define the pretest probability of a certain disease ([Table 2](#t02)). Anti-GBM antibodies are highly sensitive and specific and their presence can be confirmed by Western blot analysis. Similarly, ANCA-associated vasculitis may be diagnosed when the clinical syndrome is classic, and a confirmatory tissue diagnosis may not be necessary. In this patient, the serologic evaluation was negative, but results of examination of a kidney-biopsy specimen were interpreted as anti-GBM disease.Confronted with a negative serologic assay and a biopsy specimen showing anti-GBM disease, one has to explore the limitations of the test and consider whether the result may be a false negative. The ELISA may be spuriously negative, or the biopsy specimen may have shown nonspecific binding of IgG instead of true anti-GBM antibody. In addition, even a test that is 98% sensitive will be negative in 2% of patients with anti-GBM disease. We considered the possibility that this patient had antibodies that bound mainly to the kidney with high affinity and circulated only in low levels, below the sensitivity of the ELISA.[38](#core-r038) Higher-avidity antibodies have been shown to be associated with more severe disease.[39](#core-r039) Another possibility is that the target antigen for the anti-GBM antibody was not NC1. In patients with Alport's syndrome, who have mutations in the type IV collagen gene, anti-GBM disease may develop after transplantation in response to the normal antigen in the allograft. There is also a case report of anti-GBM disease in which the antigen was a renal 59-kD antigen.[40](#core-r040) These new autoantibodies should be detected by Western blot analysis, in which the patient's serum is screened for an autoantibody to the Goodpasture's antigen.On the basis of the clinical presentation, we believed that the patient had a low-titer, high-affinity antibody that was causing anti-GBM disease. Therefore, we requested a Western blot analysis to look for an antibody in the patient's serum to bind to the 27-kD and 54-kD proteins present in a collagenase digestion of the GBM, which form monomers and dimers in the NC1 domain of the \u03b13 chain of type IV collagen.[41,42](#core-r041) In case immunofluorescence with anti-IgG2 and anti-IgG3 would yield better staining than the traditional IgG1 staining, a subclass analysis was also sought.*Dr. Eric S. Rosenberg* (Pathology): Dr. Reisman, would you tell us what you and your team were considering when this patient arrived?*Dr. Reisman:* When this patient arrived at 1 a.m., we were aware of his rapidly progressive kidney failure, which was confirmed with a biopsy examination showing crescentic glomerulonephritis. The differential diagnosis included ANCA-associated vasculitis, anti-GBM disease, lupus, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, and IgA nephropathy. The patient's history of one episode of hemoptysis suggested Goodpasture's syndrome, whereas the vomiting suggested Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura with gastrointestinal involvement. On examination, the rash on his legs was not palpable. However, he said with certainty that if he had run his hand over the rash with his eyes closed 1 or 2 weeks ago, he would have felt a texture to it. We awaited the serologic test results, and microscopical examination of a urine sample showed proteinuria, hematuria, and numerous granular casts. The patient had already received glucocorticoids to halt the kidney-function decline; the more immediate concern that first night involved controlling his hypertension, especially given his enlarged abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Yael B. Kushner:* A kidney biopsy was performed and the tissue was processed and the diagnosis rendered at the Brigham and Women's Hospital; slides and photographs were sent to us for review. Examination of formalin-fixed tissue by light microscopy showed that about 30% of glomeruli were globally sclerotic; of the remaining glomeruli, about 20% had cellular and fibrocellular crescents within the urinary space ([Figure 3A](#f03)). The underlying glomeruli had a proliferative appearance, with occasional formation of well developed mesangial nodules ([Figure 3B](#f03)). Some glomeruli showed loss of mesangial cell nuclei and a lacy, disrupted appearance of the mesangial matrix, known as mesangiolysis ([Figure 3C](#f03)). The GBM was focally duplicated with periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining. There was a minimal interstitial inflammatory infiltrate. Chronic changes were also identified in the tubulointerstitial compartment, with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Renal tubules showed mild acute injury with epithelial-cell vacuolization and regenerative changes. A few arterioles showed marked edema with focal luminal occlusion and intramural fragmented red cells. Arterioles contained some intramural hyalinosis.Immunofluorescence studies performed on frozen tissue ([Figure 3D](#f03)) showed relatively strong staining with IgG in a linear pattern along the GBM. Fibrin was seen within cellular crescents. IgM and C3 were seen in segmentally scarred glomeruli. Electron microscopy (not shown) revealed widespread effacement of podocyte foot processes. In addition, the endothelial cells were markedly edematous with focal subendothelial electron-lucent material. Deposits were not seen, and there were no tubuloreticular inclusions or other signs of immune-complex glomerulonephritis or autoimmune disease.Cellular crescents seen on examination of a renal-biopsy specimen are the pathological equivalent of the clinical syndrome of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Distinction among anti-GBM disease, pauci-immune (ANCA-associated) glomerulonephritis, and immune-complex glomerulonephritis is made on the basis of the pattern of immunofluorescence. In this case, the presence of linear immunofluorescence reactivity for IgG along the GBM is diagnostic of anti-GBM disease, which in the presence of pulmonary manifestations is referred to as Goodpasture's syndrome. In this patient, although the initial ELISA for anti-GBM antibodies was negative, anti-GBM antibody was subsequently detected with the use of Western blot analysis ([Figure 3E](#f03)).The presence of prominent nodular glomerular changes raised the possibility of diabetic renal disease; this may have been an important pitfall in this case, because immunofluorescence studies of tissue specimens from patients with diabetes can also show a linear IgG pattern and the initial test for anti-GBM antibodies was negative in this patient. However, this patient does not have diabetes. What other possibilities exist for nodular glomerulosclerosis? Paraprotein deposition and immune-complex diseases with membranoproliferative patterns, such as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and cryoglobulinemia, can be ruled out on the basis of the findings on immunofluorescence and ultrastructural studies, as well as by the clinical history. An entity termed idiopathic nodular glomerulosclerosis has been described, typically in middle-aged men who have hypertension and who smoke.[43](#core-r043) This diagnosis is possible in the presence of mesangiolysis, since healed mesangiolysis may later change to a nodular pattern.The presence of arteriolar edema and luminal occlusion with intramural fragmented red cells along with ultrastructural signs of endothelial injury suggest subclinical thrombotic microangiopathy. Typical causes include malignant hypertension, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (indicated by a positive test for lupus anticoagulant or other antiphospholipid, such as an anticardiolipin antibody or an antibody against B2-glycoprotein 1), scleroderma, the hemolytic\u2013uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and drugs with vascular toxic effects. However, in this case, it is possible that the same injury (caused by smoking and hypertension) that led to the mesangiolysis and nodular glomerulosclerosis also led to arteriolar endothelial injury.*Dr. Bazari:* Patients confirmed to have anti-GBM disease are treated with glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis.[44](#core-r044) Aggressive treatment leads to better patient survival, approaching 85%. Renal survival with therapy is 65%, and poor prognostic criteria are oligoanuria and a serum creatinine level greater than 6 mg per deciliter (530.4 \u03bcmol per liter) at presentation.[45](#core-r045) Plasma exchange is continued until the antibody is no longer detected.*Dr. Rosenberg:* Dr. Reisman, would you tell us what happened with this patient?*Dr. Reisman:* We continued glucocorticoid therapy, used plasmapheresis to remove the anti-GBM antibodies, and started the administration of cyclophosphamide. The patient underwent open aortic aneurysm repair on the 10th hospital day, because of concern about rupture. At the time of discharge, on the 21st day, he had an undetectable level of anti-GBM antibodies in his serum, and his creatinine level was 3 mg per deciliter (265 \u03bcmol per liter). He presented 2 weeks later with progressive kidney failure that required hemodialysis. A month after that, a perforated viscus developed, and it was decided that surgical repair was not within his goals of care. He died soon thereafter.*Dr. Rosenberg:* Are there any questions?*Dr. Lloyd Axelrod* (Endocrinology): Dr. Bazari, I would be curious about your thoughts about the microangiopathic component and what the basis is for that finding.*Dr. Bazari:* The patient did not have a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. He had evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy in the kidney but not necessarily a systemic thrombotic microangiopathy. The presence of thrombotic microangiopathy on a biopsy specimen without the finding of a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia most likely results from local factors and is not a manifestation of a systemic disease.*A Physician:* In the absence of the coexisting conditions that led to his death, what would the natural history of the kidney disease have been?*Dr. Bazari:* The patient had stage 4 chronic kidney disease, with a creatinine level greater than 3 mg per deciliter. Anti-GBM disease tends to be self-limiting, and we usually treat for 3 to 6 months or until the anti-GBM antibody titer is undetectable. If there is end-stage renal disease, we still pay attention to the titer, since pulmonary hemorrhage can occur in association with the recurrence of the anti-GBM disease.\n",

      "question": "A 65-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of a persistent cough, increasing dyspnea, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.\nThere was a history of Wegener's granulomatosis 11 months earlier, with involvement of the kidneys, lungs, and paranasal sinuses; a test for antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) was positive. Prednisone and cyclophosphamide were administered, and plasmapheresis was performed. The ANCA test became negative, but renal function worsened progressively, with the development of hypertension, and long-term hemodialysis was required twice weekly. Microscopical examination of a stained specimen of sputum early in the hospital course showed acid-fast bacilli, and isoniazid and rifampin were given; the microorganisms were later identified as\nMycobacterium avium\u2013intracellulare\n, and antituberculous chemotherapy was discontinued. A test for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative. Cyclophosphamide, 25 mg daily, was continued.\nEight months before admission pulmonary infiltrates were discovered at another hospital, and the patient was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics. Two months later a persistent cough developed, with intermittent production of sputum; the cough was more severe during recumbency, and the patient began to sleep sitting up in a chair. Three months before entry microscopical examination of a transbronchial-biopsy specimen revealed a single giant cell, and examination of specially stained specimens disclosed no evidence of\nPneumocystis carinii\n, fungi, or mycobacteria; a culture yielded\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nof three types. Gentamicin was injected intravenously after each hemodialysis for two weeks, and prednisone was given by mouth. His symptoms did not improve, and the cough became productive of a cupful daily of yellow\u2014green sputum without blood. Increasing exertional dyspnea appeared, with worsening fatigue. Two weeks before entry a repeated ANCA test was negative. Another transbronchial-biopsy procedure was scheduled, but the patient was considered too ill to undergo it and was admitted to the hospital.\nThe patient was a retired hospital technologist in a discipline that did not expose him unduly to communicable diseases. He had never married and lived alone. He contracted malaria during military service in World War II, without recurrence. Diabetes mellitus developed 15 years before entry, and insulin was begun after control by dietary means for 4 years. Five years before entry angina pectoris on exertion developed, and the following year a subendocardial infarct occurred. Coronary angiographic examination showed a 70 percent stenosis of the left main coronary artery, with critical stenosis of the right coronary and circumflex arteries; a triple coronary-artery-bypass-graft procedure was performed four years before admission. He experienced recurrent bouts of abdominal pain that were ascribed to abuse of alcohol, with chronic pancreatitis. A cholecystectomy was performed eight months before admission because of recurrent pancreatitis with gallstones; in the same month he was treated at another hospital for meningitis of unknown cause. The patient smoked as many as three packs of cigarettes daily for many years and had a chronically productive cough during much of that time; he discontinued smoking one year before admission. He experienced chronic anorexia in recent months and had lost 14 kg in weight during the four months before entry. His mother died of hypertension; a brother had angina pectoris. There was no history of headache, stiff neck, otalgia, pleuritic chest pain, recent anterior chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, or allergy; there was no family history of diabetes mellitus.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse was 90, and the respirations were 24. The blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg.\nOn physical examination the patient was cachectic, with mild respiratory distress. No rash or jaundice was seen. Nontender, shotty anterior cervical lymph nodes were palpated bilaterally. The head was normal except for poor dental hygiene; no tenderness was found over the paranasal sinuses, and no oral lesions were noted. The neck was supple. Fine crackles were heard over the lower half of each lung field, more prominently on the right side; no wheezes were heard. The heart was normal. The liver and spleen were not felt on abdominal examination. A hemodialysis shunt was present in the right forearm; no peripheral edema, clubbing, or digital cyanosis was observed. Rectal examination was negative; a stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. Neurologic examination was negative.\nThe urine gave a ++++ test for glucose and a ++ test for protein; the sediment contained 1 white cell, 2 red cells, and rare granular casts per high-power field. The hematocrit was 33.3 percent; the white-cell count was 10,900, with 82 percent neutrophils, 8 percent lymphocytes, and 10 percent monocytes on an automated differential count that is insensitive to eosinophils. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 88 \u03bcm\n3\nper cell, the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 29.5 pg per red cell, and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 33.6 percent. The platelet count was 438,000. The prothrombin time was 9.3 seconds, with a control of 10.8 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 31.0 seconds. The bleeding time was 7.5 minutes (normal, 2 to 9.5). The urea nitrogen was 14 mmol per liter (38 mg per 100 ml), the creatinine 460 \u03bcmol per liter (5.2 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 7.5 mmol per liter (135 mg per 100 ml), the bilirubin 5 \u03bcmol per liter (0.3 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 2.3 mmol per liter (9.1 mg per 100 ml), the phosphorus 1.5 mmol per liter (4.5 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 70 g (the albumin 19 g and the globulin 51 g) per liter (7.0 g [1.9 g and 5.1 g] per 100 ml). The sodium was 135 mmol, the potassium 4.1 mmol, the magnesium 1.9 mmol, the chloride 90 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 28 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) was 13 U (new normal for a man, 10 to 40), and the alkaline phosphatase 146 U per liter (new normal for a man, 45 to 115). An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 103, with left atrial enlargement and minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. An x-ray film of the chest (\nFig. 1\nand\n2\n) revealed diffuse reticulonodular and patchy opacities that were more marked on the left side and were not present on a radiograph of the chest obtained three months earlier; thickening of the bronchial walls was noted, and some of the opacities appeared to follow the bronchovascular distribution; the cardiomediastinal silhouette and bony thorax appeared normal except for mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. Pulmonary-function studies disclosed that the first-second vital capacity (FEV\n1\n) was 0.81 liter (27 percent of predicted), the vital capacity (VC) 1.38 liters (37 percent of predicted), the FEV\n1\n/VC 59 percent (75 percent of predicted), the flow at 50 percent of vital capacity 0.55 liter per second (12 percent of predicted), the flow at 25 percent of vital capacity 0.16 liter per second (10 percent of predicted), the maximum breathing capacity 32 liters per minute (27 percent of predicted), the total lung capacity (TLC) 4.51 liters (88 percent of predicted), the residual volume (RV) 3.13 liters (153 percent of predicted), the RV/TLC 0.69 (173 percent of predicted), the airway resistance 5.01 cm H\n2\nO per liter per second (normal, 0.8 to 2.4), and a single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity 6.3 ml per minute per mm Hg (28 percent of predicted). A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing room air, disclosed that the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO\n2\n) was 58 mm Hg; the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO\n2\n) 38 mm Hg, and the pH 7.45.\nNPH insulin, nifedipine, and ranitidine were given, and oxygen was administered through nasal prongs; cyclophosphamide was discontinued. On the second hospital day the temperature did not exceed 37.7\u00b0C. The urea nitrogen was 15 mmol per liter (42 mg per 100 ml), the creatinine 500 \u03bcmol per liter (5.7 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 2.0 mmol per liter (8.1 mg per 100 ml), and the phosphorus 1.6 mmol per liter (5.0 mg per 100 ml). The potassium was 3.8 mmol per liter. Another hemodialysis was performed, without incident. On being returned to the floor the patient appeared sweaty and uncomfortable; the blood pressure was 110 mm Hg systolic. He improved rapidly after the intravenous injection of 50 percent glucose in saline. Blood-chemistry determinations after the hemodialysis procedure revealed that the urea nitrogen was 6.1 mmol per liter (17 mg per 100 ml), the creatinine 250 \u03bcmol per liter (2.8 mg per 100 ml), and the glucose 3.2 mmol per liter (58 mg per 100 ml). Examination by flexible bronchoscope was negative; an open-lung biopsy procedure was performed.\nOn the third hospital day the temperature was 37.4\u00b0C per axilla; diffuse rhonchi were heard bilaterally. The hematocrit was 29.4 percent; the white-cell count was 11,000, with 81 percent neutrophils, 7 percent band forms, 7 percent lymphocytes, and 5 percent monocytes. The platelet count was 383,000. The urea nitrogen was 11 mmol per liter (31 mg per 100 ml), the creatinine 410 \u03bcmol per liter (4.6 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 9.0 mmol per liter (162 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 1.9 mmol per liter (7.6 mg per 100 ml), and the phosphorus 1.8 mmol per liter (4.6 mg per 100 ml). The sodium was 129 mmol, the potassium 4.5 mmol, the magnesium 1.7 mmol, the chloride 94 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 23 mmol per liter. An electrocardiogram disclosed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 117, without other important changes. Another x-ray film of the chest showed no change except for the presence of a left chest tube. A preliminary report of the pathological examination of the lung-biopsy specimen revealed evidence of a necrotizing bronchopneumonia; microscopical examination of touch preparations showed no\nP. carinii\norganisms; a direct fluorescence antibody preparation for legionella organisms was negative; microscopical examination of stained smears disclosed rare neutrophils and no evidence of fungi, acid-fast bacilli, or other microorganisms.\nA diagnostic report was received.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Powel H. Kazanjian\\*: This middle-aged man had an indolent multinodular necrotizing pneumonia that progressed despite two courses of antibiotic therapy. It began within three months after the institution of continuous cyclophosphamide and intermittent corticosteroids for Wegener's granulomatosis. The cause could not be established after two bronchoscopic procedures. The diagnosis remained elusive after microscopical examination of surgically obtained lung tissue. Nevertheless, a diagnostic report was eventually received. What could the disease have been?May we review the x-ray films of the chest?Dr. Theresa C. McLoud: Unfortunately, we were never able to obtain the x-ray films from the other institutions where this patient was seen. A radiograph taken at the time of the transbronchial biopsy, three months before admission, shows nodular opacities in the right upper lobe. The remainder of the lungs is clear, and there is no evidence of hilar lymphadenopathy or a pleural effusion. A film taken during admission to this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001) and [2](#f002)) demonstrates a striking change since the previous radiograph. There is a diffuse reticulonodular abnormality throughout the lungs. The nodules are 3 to 4 mm in diameter and seem to spread outward from the hilus in a broncho-vascular distribution. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is visible, and there is no evidence of a pleural effusion.Dr. Kazanjian: I shall consider first noninfectious causes. Could the pulmonary nodules have represented a progression of the underlying Wegener's granulomatosis? Although the radiographic pattern of Wegener's granulomatosis may include noncavitating nodules, the characteristic pathological finding, the necrotizing granuloma, was not present in the lung-biopsy specimen. Furthermore, since antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies have been shown to be a marker of that disease,[1,2](#core-r001) the fact that the test became negative when the patient's lung disease was active is additional evidence against progression of Wegener's granulomatosis. I shall therefore exclude it as a possibility. Other noninfectious disorders to be considered include cyclophosphamide-induced lung disease, which typically occurs two to six months after initiation of treatment with that drug. A proposed mechanism is stimulation of phagocytes by cytotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in release of toxic oxygen radicals.[3](#core-r003) This possibility may be excluded by the absence of typical features of drug-induced pulmonary disease \u2014 fever, a nonproductive cough, and enlarged, bulging alveolar lining cells demonstrable on microscopical examination. An even less likely possibility is Kaposi's sarcoma, which should be considered in a person in whom a multinodular pulmonary infiltrate develops and who may have received a blood transfusion and thus an HIV infection during a surgical procedure. Kaposi's sarcoma can be excluded by the negative serologic test for HIV infection. A final possibility is so-called lentil pneumonia, a cause of multinodular infiltrates in alcoholics with poor dentition who aspirate whole legumes that are incompletely chewed and improperly swallowed.[4](#core-r004) In view of the absence of characteristic intraalveolar starch grains lentil pneumonia can be excluded.The cause of the pulmonary disease was therefore probably infectious. Virtually any microorganism is capable of causing pulmonary disease in the immunocompromised host. Although recognition of factors such as type of immunologic defect, epidemiologic pattern, physical findings, and laboratory abnormalities may reduce this number,[5](#core-r005) a single pathogen cannot be predicted reliably in this case. If a specific immunologic defect is present the list of possible infectious causes can be narrowed. In this case the disorder was widespread, with the B-cell and T-cell lymphocytes affected by cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids and the neutrophils affected by alcohol abuse and diabetes. There were no obvious epidemiologic factors to narrow the differential diagnosis, such as residence in an area where certain fungi are endemic. On physical examination there were no extrapulmonary findings that if present would suggest certain infections. Furthermore, the radiographic and pathological features are consistent with a broad array of infectious possibilities. Therefore, several infections merit discussion.Fungal and mycobacterial infections are common causes of chronic pneumonia in immunosuppressed persons. These organisms are usually latent and reactivated by steroids. For several reasons they should be considered despite their absence on microscopical examination of specially stained sections of lung tissue. First of all, the organism may not have been present in sufficient quantity to be visualized on staining but may nonetheless have been capable of producing tissue necrosis. Secondly, the organism load could have been reduced by the host's cellular immune response. Thirdly, the area of the biopsy may have been distant from the region where the microorganisms were present. In these situations the microorganism may eventually be detected by culture techniques although absent on staining. Several fungi, mycobacteria, and bacteria will be discussed with this problem in mind.Several saprophytic fungi are ubiquitous in the environment and are known to cause pulmonary infection in middle-aged alcoholic men with emphysema, who are often receiving corticosteroid therapy, precisely like the patient under discussion. The clinical features are commonly indolent, occurring without fever or leukocytosis. Progression is insidious and associated with substantial weight loss and fatigue. Multiple nodular infiltrates are apparent on x-ray films of the chest, and necrosis is seen on pathological examination. *Aspergillus fumigatus* is the most common and thoroughly described of the fungi that produce this pattern, which has been called \"chronic necrotizing\" or \"semi-invasive\" pulmonary aspergillosis.[6,7](#core-r006) This illness is in the middle of the spectrum of aspergillosis, which ranges from localized infection within the wall of a preexisting cavity to rapidly invasive and disseminated disease. A feature against aspergillosis is the failure to isolate the organism from bronchoscopically obtained specimens. In most patients in the largest reported series aspergillus was isolated from sputum specimens.[6](#core-r006) Against the diagnosis of aspergillosis is the absence of cavitation demonstrable on x-ray films of the chest, a feature that has been observed in the majority of the reported cases. Since the presentation in this case had many features of chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis but lacked its characteristic features I shall consider the other ubiquitous fungi that may cause a similar clinical picture.*Cryptococcus neoformans* is present in soil that has been contaminated by pigeon or chicken excreta, and the route of infection is by inhalation. HIV infection is a common but certainly not requisite factor predisposing to cryptococcal infection. The radiographic appearance may begin as a single nodule and gradually progress with the formation of \"satellite\" nodules.[8](#core-r008) Cavitation occurs in 35 percent of the cases, and hilar lymphadenopathy is occasionally present. The pathological findings in this case are consistent with those of cryptococcal pneumonia, which range from minimal inflammation and variable granuloma formation with infection by encapsulated strains to suppurative necrosis with infection by nonencapsulated strains.[9](#core-r009) Mucicarmine staining is diagnostic of *C. neoformans* when it colors a small portion of the capsule red. Although hematogenous spread and meningeal involvement are common, I doubt that the \"meningitis of unknown cause\" in this case was due to cryptococcosis, since it could not have been treated effectively without specific antifungal therapy. A reactive serum cryptococcal antigen test would have been suggestive but not diagnostic of cryptococcal disease, since false positive tests have been reported in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis and in infections caused by less common fungi such as *Trichosporon beigelii*[10](#core-r010) a rare opportunistic fungus. This small pleomorphic yeast with septal hyphae and arthroconidia may be inconspicuous on staining and yet cause chronic necrotizing bronchopneumonia.[11](#core-r011) *Geotrichum candidum*, another uncommon fungus, is similarly distributed in the environment and has been shown to cause a similar human disease even more rarely. Only two cases with proved tissue invasion have been reported.[12](#core-r012) *Penicillium marneffei* [13](#core-r013) is another rare saphrophyte, which is mentioned because it is endemic in Southeast Asia, where the patient was probably stationed during World War II. His acquisition of malaria during World War II suggests service in this region. However, it would be unlikely for this fungus to have remained dormant for 45 years or for the patient to have acquired the fungus by an accidental cutaneous inoculation in the laboratory, a situation that has been reported only once.[14](#core-r014) *Sporothrix schenckii* is a small, ovoid yeast that is occasionally missed on a silver stain but when present may be coated with refractile eosinophilic material that forms asteroid bodies.[15](#core-r015) The diagnosis is usually established by culturing material from clinical specimens. This patient lacked the typical occupational history, since the disease is described predominantly in farmers, gardeners, forestry workers, and florists exposed to the soil and sphagnum moss, where this organism resides. The chance of substantial exposure in a hospital laboratory worker is remote. More obscure fungi capable of causing this patient's chronic pneumonia are *Emmonsia crescens* [16](#core-r016) and *Allescheria boydii*.[17](#core-r017) However, emmonsia is not endemic in the United States but is most prevalent in Eastern European nations, and allescheria occurs most often in the setting of preexisting cavitary disease.Mucor and Fusarium are fungi that may cause necrotizing pneumonia, but its rate of progression is typically more rapid than this patient's course; infection due to the former typically occurs in acidotic patients,[18](#core-r018) and infection due to the latter occurs in neutropenic patients.[19](#core-r019) More commonly occurring fungi, such as *Histoplasma capsulatum*, *Blastomyces dermatiditis*, and *Coccidioides immitis*, can be excluded on the basis of lack of residence in a region where they are endemic.Since the patient's illness had many features of the fungal diseases that I discussed but failed to exhibit a classic pattern for any particular fungal infection, I shall turn to mycobacteria. The patient's tracheal tree had been colonized with *Mycobacterium avium\u2013intracellulare*. Could it have become pathogenic after alteration of the host's defenses by corticosteroids? In the absence of HIV infection *M. avium\u2013intracellulare* may produce a disease that is similar in pattern to the fungal diseases that I discussed previously. Although patients without a predisposing illness have become infected,[20](#core-r020) middle-aged men with emphysema taking steroids have been well-described hosts for infection due to this organism.[21](#core-r021) Slowly progressive nodular opacities demonstrable on x-ray films are the predominant pattern. However, the usual pathological picture is that of a bland, foamy histiocytic infiltrate, with or without granuloma formation. The necrosis observed in this case would be an unusual finding. Another unusual finding is the absence of growth in repeated samples of sputum. Because of the lack of these typical features of *M. avium\u2013intracellulare* infection and the absence of a history of a reactive tuberculin skin test I assume that the mycobacterium was a colonizing agent rather than a pathogen. The same arguments hold for *M. chelonae* and *M. tuberculosis*. The former organism may be introduced through hemodialysis tubing and has been reported as a cause of chronic nodular pneumonia in patients undergoing hemodialysis.[22,23](#core-r022) In regard to *M. tuberculosis*, it is possible that the offending organism was misidentified as *M. avium\u2013intracellulare* and was in fact *M. tuberculosis*, and that dissemination then occurred associated with corticosteroid therapy. However, the x-ray films of the chest in the setting of dissemination typically show a more finely nodular pattern, and necrosis without granuloma formation would be unusual. Because of these features this case would not be a typical example of mycobacterial infection.I am led to consideration of certain bacteria that although capable of staining were not stained. Most prominent on this list is *Nocardia asteroides*. This beaded organism may be stained as gram-positive and not require a modified acid-fast stain. Although alveolar proteinosis is the lung disorder that usually underlies infection by this organism, other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, and bronchiectasis, may predispose to nocardiosis as well.[24](#core-r024) Scattered, diffuse nodules are a common radiographic appearance, with cavitation occurring in 20 to 50 percent of the cases.[25](#core-r025) Important extrapulmonary findings include meningitis, a brain abscess, and skin nodules. It is conceivable but unlikely that the \"meningitis of unknown cause\" in this patient was due to nocardia organisms that were not detected in spinal fluid because of their slow growth, often appearing after seven days of incubation. It is possible that the patient was treated for his meningitis of unknown cause with an antibiotic that had activity against nocardia and partially treated his pulmonary disease. Also, giant cells and necrosis are frequently seen in pathological specimens in this disease. Respiratory tract cultures may be negative, since rapidly growing oral organisms may obscure small colonies of nocardia and the pink, rugate appearance characteristic of colonization that is sufficient to arouse suspicion often requires two to four weeks to develop. The typical pathological feature of nocardiosis that is absent in this case is suppuration. That fact together with the lack of cavitation would make this case an unusual example of nocardiosis.Other bacterial causes are even less likely. Actinomyces may result in indolent pneumonia, especially in a patient with poor dentition and alcoholism who is vulnerable to aspiration. Although the failure to find sulfur granules does not exclude actinomycosis,[26](#core-r026) the absence of fever, pleural thickening due to the organism's ability to spread beyond tissue planes, and a fibrinopurulent exudate on pathological examination of lung tissue makes infection due to actinomyces unlikely.*Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, which was originally grown from a transbronchial-biopsy specimen, could not have caused this patient's prolonged, indolent course and probably was a contaminant in the bronchial tree. On occasion the widely used automated gram-negative identification system fails to differentiate *P. aeruginosa* from other pseudomonas species. Although chronic progressive nodular pneumonia may be caused by *P. pseudomallei* and the disease may remain dormant for many years before reactivation, the time between the patient's only potential exposure in Southeast Asia in World War II and the onset of his illness exceeded the longest reported duration of dormancy, 26 years.[27](#core-r027) Another feature that is lacking is the demonstration of typical upper-lobe cavitating lesions on x-ray films of the chest. *P. mallei* may cause a similar picture with lymphadenopathy and meningitis as well. It stains poorly with a Gram stain and is best demonstrated with a methylene blue stain. Although infection due to this organism may be contracted by laboratory workers, this diagnosis can be excluded, since there have been no cases of acquired disease in the United States since 1938 as a result of improved sanitation and control measures. The patient had not traveled to Asia, Africa, or South America, where sporadic cases are still seen. The primary disease occurs in livestock, with infection of human beings by inhalation of bacteria.*Listeria monocytogenes* is an unlikely pathogen, even though the patient was receiving corticosteroid treatment and meningitis occurred during the early part of the illness. Since listeria should have grown from the spinal fluid and sputum, this diagnosis can be excluded. Legionella species are also unlikely, although the underlying disturbances of host defense in this patient (cigarette smoking, chronic obstructive lung disease, steroid use, advanced age, and renal disease) are typical of legionella infection. Since the sensitivity of the direct fluorescence antibody test for the *Legionella pneumophila* strain ranges from 20 to 80 percent and is unknown for non-pneumophila species, the non-reactive direct fluorescence antibody test in this case does not exclude legionella. More sensitive tests that have been reported, in addition to culture on charcoal\u2014yeast extract, are the genus-specific DNA probe and urinary antigen.[28](#core-r028) Since the rate of progression of the disease is typically rapid without specific therapy, legionellosis can be excluded.The clinical features of this case are not typical of infection due to any particular fungal, mycobacterial, or bacterial organism that has been considered. I shall address the possibility that organisms that cannot be stained were responsible for producing this patient's illness.Viruses make up the first group of agents in this category. Viruses known to cause pneumonia in the immunocompromised patient, such as herpes simplex, varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus, have not been associated with chronic, slowly progressive nodular pulmonary infiltrates. Although necrosis may be seen in the alveolar walls and peribronchial region in all viral infections, extensive bronchopneumonia is typically seen with adenoviral pneumonia. Also, intranuclear inclusions are found frequently within alveolar lining cells in most viral pneumonias.[29](#core-r029) In the absence of these features a viral pneumonia seems unlikely.Parasitic infections also merit consideration. *Strongyloides stercoralis* is endemic throughout the tropics. The chronicity of *S. stercoralis* infestation makes past potential exposures pertinent. The experience of World War II veterans who served in Asia has helped to document the persistence of the infection for at least 50 years.[30](#core-r030) This patient's acquisition of malaria in World War II suggests service in Asia. Chronic strongyloidiasis may be undiagnosed for up to 50 years and become manifest with mild pulmonary problems. Corticosteroids, chronic renal failure, and alcoholism all alter the host\u2014parasite relation and can result in accelerated autoinfection. Eosinophilia, a feature that is seen frequently but not invariably, may have been present but not detected because of the insensitivity of the automated cell counter to eosinophils.Hyperinfection with strongyloides may present with many of the features of this patient's illness. Common gastrointestinal manifestations include abdominal pain, weight loss, and malnutrition. Pulmonary manifestations include a cough, sputum production, diarrhea, and bronchospasm. Radiographic findings may include diffuse pulmonary nodular infiltrates. Neurologic involvement, although rare, has complicated the course in some patients. Furthermore, pancreatitis has been reported. Secondary gram-negative bacterial infections, including bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, and superimposed bacterial pneumonia, have been frequent findings in more recent case reports. The pathogenesis of the secondary bacterial infections may be disruption of the bowel mucosa by the penetrating filariform larvae, facilitating hematogenous spread of enteric organisms attached to the surface of the parasites. Against the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis is the absence of the hallmark of chronic strongyloidiasis, an urticarial maculopapular skin eruption that is due to migration of infective filariform larvae through skin (larvae currens). Also, the onset of pulmonary findings after the initiation of steroid therapy is usually more rapid than the three-month interval that was seen in this case. Furthermore, the rate of progression of superimposed gram-negative pneumonia is more fulminant than the course in this case, and filariform larvae would be expected to appear in bronchioles in lung-biopsy specimens. Because of these features the hyperinfection syndrome of chronic strongyloidiasis is improbable.*Toxoplasma gondii* can also cause latent infection and persist in tissues throughout the life of the host and reactivate with immunosuppression. Corticosteroid therapy is sufficient to reactivate infection; HIV infection is not required. Therefore, remote exposure to cats becomes pertinent, an exposure that is not unusual in our society, in which domestication of cats is common. A less likely route of infection would be by whole-blood transfusion during the cardiac surgical procedure. Although pulmonary involvement with toxoplasma is rare, when it occurs x-ray films of the chest may show interstitial disease or multiple foci of bronchopneumonia. On pathological examination the cysts are difficult to find in tissues and may be missed on routine hematoxylin-and-eosin stains and revealed only on Giemsa staining,[31](#core-r031) and because of their small size the tachyzoites may easily be missed on routine pathological examination. Tissue necrosis can occur. Pneumonia has been reported to occur in the absence of involvement of other organs. Although rare, pulmonary toxoplasmosis remains a possibility.Gram-negative bacteria need to be considered. They include rickettsia (Q fever) and *Chlamydia psittaci*, which can be excluded on epidemiologic grounds in the absence of residence in regions where these organisms are endemic or of exposure to psittacine birds. Furthermore, pulmonary involvement due to these organisms typically has an acute rather than chronic and indolent course. Other chlamydial diseases deserve consideration. *Chlamydia trachomatis* has previously been isolated from the lung of an immunocompromised patient with hypogammaglobulinemia and may cause pneumonia in neonates.[32](#core-r032) The failure to find inclusion bodies does not exclude the presence of chlamydia, since they are seldom seen in pneumonias. However, the pathological features, which typically do not include necrosis, and the rate of progression, which is more rapid than that of this patient's pneumonia, make *C. trachomatis* infection unlikely. Finally, *Chlamydia pneumoniae* (TWAR) typically causes a self-limited, community-acquired pneumonia in healthy adults. Since the illnesses have not been severe enough to require a biopsy, the pathological features are not known. None of the chlamydia infections seem likely in this case.The final consideration is mycoplasma species. The major concern is *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*. Relapsing mycoplasma infections have been described, and aseptic meningitis has been an associated feature. The relapse usually occurs in the same segment of the lung. Features against mycoplasma infection in this case are the patient's advanced age, lack of exposure to children, productive cough, and progressive rather than relapsing symptoms. The pathological features of this disease are not well described, since an open-lung biopsy has been required in very few cases. Other mycoplasma species are even less likely causes. *M. hominis* has been isolated from pleural fluid but has not been described as a cause of chronic pneumonia.[33](#core-r033) There has been speculation that the described but unproved organism *M. incognitus* causes chronic necrotizing pneumonia, but since this has not been proved I shall exclude it as a possibility.[34](#core-r034) An even more remote possibility is *Brucella suis*, which has been described as causing a chronic nodular pneumonia and meningitis.[35](#core-r035) Although this organism has been shown to be spread by aerosolization to laboratory workers, it is unlikely that such an exposure occurred while the patient was employed in the hospital. There are no other historical features of this case that may have exposed the patient to brucella.What, then, was the offending pathogen? I cannot conclude reliably what it might have been. The clinical pattern was not typical of a particular organism but had features that may be caused by a variety of organisms. Testing for their presence in surgically obtained lung tissue with special stains (mucicarmine, modified acid-fast, and Giemsa), immunoenzyme tests for chlamydia, and special culture media (charcoal\u2014yeast extract and tissue-cell cultures) and the radio-metric culture system for mycobacteria are the most fruitful methods of achieving a diagnosis. A variant presentation of the more commonly occurring bacteria, including mycobacteria, and fungi is statistically more likely than a typical presentation of a rare organism. In the spirit of this conference I shall conclude that the diagnostic report was a modified acid-fast stain revealing *N. asteroides*. Since many other commonly occurring organisms mentioned produce clinically indistinguishable disease, cryptococcus, aspergillus, and *M. avium\u2013intracellulare* are also high on the list. Less likely are the more unusual fungi such as emmonsia and bacteria such as *P. pseudomallei*. I shall be surprised if the diagnostic test was an immunofluorescence test for chlamydia or a culture for mycoplasma, legionella, or a virus, since chronic pneumonia would be a new presentation of infection due to these organisms.Dr. Eugene J. Mark: Dr. Axelrod, you were the patient's primary physician. Do you wish to comment?Dr. Lloyd Axelrod: We, too, were concerned about the possibility of an opportunistic infection in this patient, who had Wegener's granulomatosis and had been treated with cyclophosphamide and steroids. We were frustrated by our inability to identify an organism consistent with the possibility of opportunistic infection and therefore proceeded from a transbronchial biopsy to the open-lung biopsy. There was an interval of several weeks between the performance of an open-lung biopsy and the availability of the diagnostic report, and during that time the only positive findings that we had were the cultures for pseudomonas. I was very dissatisfied with the diagnosis of a pseudomonas infection because, as Dr. Kazanjian has pointed out, the patient's course was atypical for it both clinically and radiographically. However, three different types of *P. aeruginosa* grew out at the time of the transbronchial biopsy, and two of them grew out very rapidly, within a day or two, after the open-lung biopsy from direct culture of the specimen. In addition, our infectious-disease consultants suggested that we consider an analogy with cystic fibrosis, with which pseudomonas pneumonia can occur and present with a radiographic pattern similar to that in this patient. For these reasons the patient was initially treated with gentamicin and ceftazidime. As the sensitivity results became available and we learned that both types of pseudomonas were resistant to gentamicin, we switched to tobramycin and continued the ceftazidime. With that regimen plus aggressive pulmonary therapy the patient's condition improved but at a frustratingly slow rate over several weeks. We thought that possibly we were treating the pseudomonas infection but because of the slow but persistent progress were not satisfied with that diagnosis.Dr. Mark: Dr. Fienberg, do you have any comments on the Wegener's granulomatosis and the ANCA test?Dr. Robert Fienberg: This case of Wegener's granulomatosis was one in which the ANCA test was positive and became negative during treatment with cyclophosphamide. This negativity indicated that the inflammatory process had become quiescent, and as long as the negativity persisted a deterioration of the patient's clinical picture was most likely due to a secondary infection of the lung. I have been impressed by the rapid disappearance of the granulomatous lesions with cyclophosphamide therapy. Unfortunately, if the lesions are large and extensive, reconstruction of the pulmonary architecture is impossible because of fibrosis, and this circumstance together with an immuno-depressed state caused by continued cyclophosphamide therapy readily leads to infection by various pathogenic agents. The treatment is usually given for one year. I am uncertain how long the cyclophosphamide was given to this patient.The Wegener's granulomatosis was treated adequately. Perhaps a plea may be made not to push the cyclophosphamide therapy too far, to avoid a secondary infection. Apparently, the kidney did not respond to the cyclophosphamide. If a sufficient number of glomeruli are involved in the focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis the inflammation in the glomerulus disappears on treatment, but the glomerulus may become functionless as a result of fibrosis.Dr. Axelrod: We had initially decided to treat the patient for one year with cyclophosphamide for the purpose of controlling the lung disease, recognizing that there was no hope of improving the kidney disease. It is interesting that the patient was taking a relatively small dose of 25 mg a day for most of the one-year course. He had initially been taking larger doses, but leukopenia developed. So we reduced the dose, and even a dose of 37.5 mg per day produced leukopenia. We took that occurrence as evidence that small doses were producing a biologic effect, at least on the bone marrow, but we had some persistent concern about whether the drug was producing an additional effect on the Wegener's granulomatosis. Nevertheless, we continued that small dose until the ANCA test became negative and the biopsy result was available.Dr. Mark: Dr. Axelrod, this patient had long-standing diabetes. Were you confident that the renal failure was due to Wegener's granulomatosis and not to diabetic glomerulosclerosis?Dr. Axelrod: Yes. The patient had had diabetes for about 15 years. It was due to alcoholic pancreatitis, which had responded very well to abstinence for more than a decade, leaving him only with the residuum of diabetes. However, he had no proteinuria and had had no previous evidence of renal insufficiency. In addition, the rapid deterioration of his renal function was not consistent with diabetic nephropathy. Finally, the renal biopsy provided no evidence of diabetic nephropathy and only evidence consistent with Wegener's granulomatosis.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Mark: Microscopical examination of the lung-biopsy specimen showed discrete nodules of inflammation in bronchioles and alveoli ([Fig. 3](#f003)). Lymphocytes and histiocytes were the predominant cells in this focal bronchopneumonia. Organizing fibrin filled alveoli at the edge of the inflammatory nodules ([Fig. 4](#f004)). Acute and organizing bronchiolitis, characterized by focal mucosal necrosis and filling of the lumen by neutrophils and histiocytes, was found in the centers of some nodules ([Fig. 5](#f005)). The nodules were 2 to 5 mm in diameter, correlating with the radiographic findings. The intervening lung was relatively normal. The histologic changes indicate a subacute infection despite the fact that special stains demonstrated no organisms and viral inclusions were not present. Neither a diffuse expanding pseudomonas pneumonia nor pseudomonas vasculitis was present. There was no evidence of Wegener's granulomatosis.Tissue from the biopsy specimen was sent to a laboratory specializing in identification of chlamydia. Three weeks after the biopsy the laboratory reported that intracytoplasmic elementary bodies suggestive of either *C. psittaci* or *C. pneumoniae* were seen in McCoy cell culture. The inclusions due to *C. trachomatis* are vacuolar and contain glycogen, whereas those due to *C. psittaci* and *C. pneumoniae* are round and dense and cannot be stained for glycogen. The inclusions in this case were of the latter type, and *C. trachomatis* could be excluded. Chlamydial antigens have been demonstrated immunopathologically.[36,37](#core-r036) Dr. Frances Moore, Director of the Clinical Laboratory at the Angell Memorial Animal Hospital in Boston, looked for chlamydia by a peroxidase\u2013antiperoxidase method with a monoclonal antibody, and the test was negative. However, a convalescent serum sample contained antibody to *C. pneumoniae*.Three species of chlamydia produce pulmonary disease in human beings. Although *C. trachomatis* generally causes urogenital and conjunctival disease, it has caused pneumonia in infants and less commonly in adults.[32,38\u201343](#core-r032) *C. psittaci* is the cause of psittacosis, which is an endemic disease of parrots and can spread to human beings.[44,45](#core-r044) The same disease is also known as ornithosis when it spreads to persons from birds other than parrots. This patient had no exposure to sick birds, but only a minority of patients with psittacosis give such a history. *C. pneumoniae*, also known as the TWAR agent or TWAR strain of *C. psittaci*, produces mild pneumonia in the community and in epidemics.[46\u201351](#core-r046) Of the three species, only *C. trachomatis* has been particularly associated with disease in immunosuppressed patients.[32](#core-r032)The histopathological findings of nonfatal chlamydial infection in the lung in human beings are not well known. Bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia, as found in this case, have been described, and capillary thrombosis has also been noted. The intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies are seen in vitro but not generally in lung tissue in human beings. The most distinctive features are the circumscription of the pneumonia, normalcy of the intervening lung, and paucity of pus.Dr. Axelrod, will you give us the follow-up findings on this patient?Dr. Axelrod: When the diagnostic report of chlamydial infection was obtained we added doxycycline to the patient's regimen of tobramycin and ceftazidime. His subsequent course has been very satisfactory. He has recovered from the cough and now has no pulmonary symptoms. In fact, he recently resumed playing the saxophone, which he had done a number of years ago.Dr. Kazanjian: A chronic, indolent multinodular pneumonia in an immunosuppressed patient is a presentation of the TWAR agent that has not been described previously. Even in immunosuppressed patients *C. trachomatis* infection has an abrupt onset with a fulminant course. Additional evidence in support of *C. trachomatis* or TWAR as the cause of this patient's illness, such as direct fluorescent staining of material grown on culture or serologic conversion, would have been useful.Dr. Mark: Pneumonia due to the TWAR strain of chlamydia generally is an indolent and self-limited disease. Most of the patients do not enter the hospital. This patient had disease that was worse than that but did not have the fulminant fatal form, which has been studied more extensively at autopsy.Dr. Kazanjian: Yes. I still think that this is a new presentation of disease due to the TWAR agent.\n",

      "question": "An 11-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of fevers and pulmonary infiltrates. One month before admission, a month after beginning a visit to India with his parents, daily fevers, with temperatures up to 38.9\u00b0C, developed, without localizing signs or symptoms. Before the family left for India, the boy's primary care physician gave him one dose of immunoglobulin intramuscularly for hepatitis A prophylaxis and prescribed mefloquine weekly for malaria prophylaxis. He was evaluated at an Indian health care facility, and amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was administered, but there was no improvement. On the sixth day after the onset of fevers, mefloquine was stopped and chloroquine was administered for 3 days, followed by ciprofloxacin for 3 days. Fever persisted, and a nonproductive cough developed.\nNineteen days before his admission to this hospital, the patient was admitted to a hospital in India. His blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg and his pulse 138 beats per minute; although he had been febrile, his temperature was normal. Hepatosplenomegaly was noted, but the results of the remainder of the examination were normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. No parasites were seen on examination of a peripheral-blood smear, and a test for serum antibodies to\nSalmonella typhi\nwas negative. A chest radiograph showed an irregular perihilar parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms and multiple smaller air-space opacities in the left perihilar region. Ampicillin\u2013sulbactam and amikacin were administered intravenously. A tuberculin skin test showed no induration after 48 hours, and the temperature, which had been fluctuating, returned to normal on the fifth hospital day. Intravenous fluid being infused through a catheter inserted in the dorsum of the right distal forearm infiltrated into the tissue, and an adhesive bandage was applied over the site. The patient was discharged on the sixth hospital day, receiving oral amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate and clarithromycin, and his cough gradually resolved. Nine days after discharge, and 5 days before admission to this hospital, he returned to the United States.\nTwo days after his return to the United States, his temperature rose to 39\u00b0C, and fever recurred daily thereafter. The amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was stopped after completion of the course of therapy; the day before admission to this hospital, the clarithromycin was completed. On the day of admission, he was evaluated at the office of his primary care physician; his temperature was 38.7\u00b0C. An erythematous nodule, 15 to 18 mm in diameter, was present on the dorsum of the right distal forearm, at the site of the previous venipuncture. There were no other localizing signs or symptoms. A chest radiograph showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. A biopsy of the nodule on the forearm was performed, and specimens were sent for culture and pathological examination. The patient was referred to this hospital for admission.\nThe patient was born in the United States after a full-term gestation to a primigravid mother; delivery was by cesarean section because of cephalopelvic disproportion. At birth, the patient's weight was 3.075 kg (21st percentile) and his length 53.3 cm (90th percentile). At 6 weeks of age, he had been admitted to another hospital for a self-limited episode of fever and poor feeding. A palpable spleen tip was noted on examination, and ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed that the spleen was 6.2 cm in length, the upper limit of normal for his age. A culture of the blood was sterile; his temperature returned to normal and he was discharged. Follow-up ultrasonography of the abdomen 1 month after discharge was normal. Routine immunizations were given, and developmental milestones and growth parameters were normal. At 6 months of age, his weight was 7.1 kg (18th percentile) and length 71 cm (92nd percentile). While in India, the patient and his parents had stayed with relatives in an urban area, and the patient had close contact with many people, including a relative with pulmonary tuberculosis who was receiving triple-drug therapy. There were no exposures to animals. The patient had no allergies to medications, and in the United States he lived with his parents and did not attend day care. His parents were professionals who had emigrated from India. There was no family history of recurrent febrile illnesses, rheumatologic diseases, or immunodeficiency.\nOn examination, he appeared well \u2014 he was playful and breathing comfortably. His weight was 8.2 kg (3rd percentile), temperature 39.3\u00b0C, pulse 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate 42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% while breathing ambient air. A well-circumscribed area of erythema and induration, 1 cm by 2 cm, was present on the dorsum of the right forearm, and the incision from the biopsy was clean and dry. The lungs were clear, and the results of the remainder of the physical examination were normal. Levels of serum electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the test results for renal and liver function; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\nTable 1\n. Tests of nasal secretions for antigens of adenovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed nodular areas of consolidation throughout both lungs, some with calcification. The larger opacities were in the upper lobes, up to 2.6 cm by 1.7 cm by 1.9 cm. Some were contiguous with the hila and extended to the pleural surface. Soft-tissue fullness in the mediastinum, hila, and left axilla suggested lymphadenopathy. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were administered orally and ceftriaxone intravenously.\nOn the second hospital day, the temperature rose to 39.7\u00b0C. A tuberculin skin test was performed, and an aspirate of gastric secretions obtained in the early morning was sent for acid-fast staining and mycobacterial culture. Isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and rifampin were begun. Analysis of a urine specimen was normal, and a culture of the urine specimen, collected in an external bag, grew few mixed flora. Specimens of stool were sent for culture of enteric pathogens, presence of\nClostridium difficile\ntoxin, and ova and parasitologic analysis.\nDuring the next 3 days, two additional early-morning specimens of gastric aspirate were obtained; staining did not reveal acid-fast bacilli and cultures were pending. On the fourth hospital day, the temperature rose to 40\u00b0C and the patient vomited intermittently, occasionally after episodes of coughing productive of white sputum. The site of the tuberculin skin test showed no induration. The next day, the temperature fluctuated between 34.6 and 40.1\u00b0C. Serum IgG antibodies to cytomegalovirus were present; test results for Epstein\u2013Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus antibodies in the serum and legionella and histoplasma urine antigens were negative. Other laboratory-test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Additional specimens of blood were sent for culture; results of other tests were pending. A review of the slides from the skin biopsy that had been performed earlier revealed scattered nuclear debris and rare structures suggestive of fungal hyphae; in deeper sections stained for organisms, these structures were no longer visible. Ceftriaxone was stopped and meropenem and liposomal amphotericin were administered intravenously.\nOn the sixth hospital day, emesis was tinged with blood, and a sample of stool was guaiac-positive. The respiratory rate transiently increased to 66 to 75 breaths per minute, with oxygen saturations between 98 and 100%, then returned to 32 to 44 breaths per minute. The temperature ranged from 33.9 to 39.6\u00b0C. Additional chest radiography continued to show bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. A diagnostic procedure was performed on the seventh hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Jason B. Harris:* May we review the radiologic studies?*Dr. Sjirk J. Westra:* CT of the chest, performed on admission without the administration of contrast material, showed several ill-defined nodules in the posterior lung zones, several of which contained calcifications; the nodules blended with the pulmonary hila ([Figure 1A](#f01)), and some extended to the pleura. One week later, CT of the chest performed with the administration of intravenous contrast material showed fullness of the soft tissues in the mediastinum, which could be explained by the normal thymus, and mild prominence of the hilar lymph nodes. The tracheobronchial tree was normally patent. Large nodules were present, predominantly in the upper lobes of the lungs, with ill-defined and spiculated margins, which was probably indicative of inflammation; the larger nodules were calcified ([Figure 1B](#f01)). A chest radiograph taken 5 days later ([Figure 1C](#f01)) showed ill-defined nodular infiltrates, predominantly in the middle- and upper-lung zones, and ill-defined hilar markings.The differential diagnosis of bilateral nodular pulmonary consolidation with calcifications includes granulomatous infection, particularly tuberculosis. However, calcification does not occur in primary tuberculosis, and postprimary tuberculosis would be unusual in this young child. Chronic fungal infections frequently calcify, whereas bacterial and pneumocystic infections are not usually associated with calcification. Given the clinical presentation and the appearance of these nodules, a calcifying neoplastic process, such as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (inflammatory pseudotumor) or a metastatic malignant tumor, was believed to be less likely than an infection.*Dr. Harris:* I participated in the care of this patient and am aware of the diagnosis. Fever and a cough developed in this infant during travel in India, and they recurred despite antibiotic therapy. On admission, his weight gain had slowed. Imaging studies showed a chronic multinodular pneumonia with calcification. Our differential diagnosis included infectious and noninfectious conditions, and we considered the possibility that his condition might be a manifestation of primary immunodeficiency.\n### Infection with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*\n\nThis patient's young age and close contact with an adult with pulmonary tuberculosis suggested a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, the most common cause of chronic pneumonia in the world, with approximately 2 million cases per year in India.[1](#core-r001) Infants younger than 1 year of age who are infected with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* are at extremely high risk for the development of active disease, estimated to approach 40% in the first 2 years of life as compared with a 5 to 10% cumulative lifetime risk of disease in immunocompetent adults.[2](#core-r002) Does this patient's clinical presentation support the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis?First, is the incubation period consistent with tuberculosis? This child's symptoms developed 1 month after arriving in India. Infants, unlike older children or adults, often present with symptomatic primary tuberculosis 3 to 8 weeks after exposure, and disseminated disease, such as miliary or meningeal tuberculosis, may develop 2 to 6 months after exposure.[3](#core-r003) Are the other clinical characteristics of the patient's illness consistent with tuberculosis? Although infants are more likely than adults to present with extrapulmonary disease, the majority of infants diagnosed with tuberculosis in the United States do in fact have isolated pulmonary disease.[4](#core-r004) They typically present with nonproductive cough and fever, as present with nonproductive cough and fever, as this patient did. The erythematous cutaneous nodule at the site of an intravenous catheter could be a cutaneous manifestation of tuberculosis, although this would be unusual. However, the nodule might have resulted from an unrelated infection, and it appeared to be resolving at the time of admission. A transient response to amikacin may also be seen in *M. tuberculosis* infection. Are the radiographic findings consistent with tuberculosis? Parenchymal lung disease and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are characteristic of pulmonary tuberculosis in infants. Often there is a primary complex, consisting of a parenchymal lesion with associated lymphadenitis. Although miliary involvement can occur in congenital tuberculosis, the presence of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, some with calcification, suggesting multifocal granulomatous inflammation, is atypical.Finally, what can we learn from the diagnostic studies that were obtained in the first few days of the patient's hospitalization? Acid-fast bacilli stains of early-morning gastric aspirates are often negative in children with pulmonary tuberculosis and have little negative predictive value; however, cultures will be positive in up to 70% of infants with pulmonary tuberculosis.[4](#core-r004) This patient also had a negative response to a purified-protein-derivative (PPD) skin test for tuberculosis. Although the majority of infants with disseminated tuberculosis initially have a negative response to this test, 80 to 90% of immunocompetent infants with isolated pulmonary tuberculosis test positive.[4,5](#core-r004) Although not definitive, the negative result on the PPD skin test suggests that this patient either did not have tuberculosis or was immunocompromised. Although we were concerned enough to treat this patient empirically for possible tuberculosis, we considered other infectious and noninfectious causes of his illness.\n### Other Causes of Chronic Multinodular Pneumonia\n\nHistoplasmosis is endemic in India and in the United States and can mimic tuberculosis. It can manifest as a primary pulmonary infection, though infants are predisposed to progressive reticuloendothelial infection characterized by fever, failure to thrive, and hepatosplenomegaly. In this case, a urine antigen test was negative. Blastomyces and cryptococcus are also found in India and can cause chronic pneumonia and cutaneous manifestations, including isolated skin nodules and ulcers. However, these infections rarely result in calcified lung lesions. Aspergillus species are an important cause of nodular pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts, particularly patients with hematologic malignancies, neutropenia, or phagocyte disorders, and chronic infections may calcify. Thus, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis due to an underlying immunodeficiency was a consideration, despite the fact that this child had been healthy for the first 10 months of life.Nontuberculous mycobacteria need to be considered, especially in view of the negative finding on the PPD skin test and the partial clinical response to amikacin, which is active against nontuberculous mycobacteria. However, pulmonary infection of this magnitude with nontuberculous mycobacteria is rare in a healthy host, and symptoms recurred on use of clarithromycin, which is highly active against most nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. *Burkholderia pseudomallei,* the causative agent of melioidosis, is endemic in India and can manifest as a chronic, multinodular pneumonia. Skin manifestations, including ulcers and abscesses, can occur in isolation or as part of disseminated disease; thus, melioidosis was a possible diagnosis in this case. *Rhodococcus equi* is an increasingly recognized cause of chronic nodular pneumonia in immunocompromised patients; however, infection with *R. equi* is typically associated with exposures to animals or soil, neither of which was present in this case. Nocardia species can cause chronic lung infections, including multinodular pneumonia, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Paragonimus, a lung fluke that is endemic in India, can present as chronic pneumonia with multiple calcified nodules; however, most patients have peripheral blood eosinophilia and a history of shellfish exposure, neither of which applied in this case.Sarcoidosis is a chronic pulmonary granulomatous disease; however, the infantile form, Blau syndrome, does not typically involve the lungs. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (also known as inflammatory pseudotumor or plasma-cell granuloma), the most common primary lung tumor in children, is often associated with calcification. [6](#core-r006) However, most of these tumors are solitary lung lesions and are not associated with fever. Metastatic Wilms' tumor or neuroblastoma can occur at this age, but there is no evidence of a primary tumor in the abdomen.\n### Chronic Multinodular Pneumonia as a Manifestation of Primary Immunodeficiency\n\nAn early concern was that the patient had a primary immunodeficiency. Primary immunodeficiency disorders are typically suspected in the presence of repeated infections, opportunistic infections, failure to thrive, a positive family history for such a disorder, hematologic abnormalities, abnormal responses to common infections, or characteristic features of a syndrome associated with immunodeficiency, such as DiGeorge's syndrome, which is distinguished by cleft palate, endocrine abnormalities, and congenital heart defects. Because many immunodeficiency syndromes can present after 6 months of age, the fact that this child had thrived in early infancy does not exclude such a diagnosis. Although we had not documented the presence of an opportunistic infection, the finding of multiple calcified pulmonary nodules suggested that a chronic granulomatous process preceded the visit to India and the development of symptoms. This could represent an abnormal response to infection \u2014 a characteristic feature of chronic granulomatous disease.Chronic granulomatous disease, which is due to a primary defect of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase pathway, is one of the most common serious primary immunodeficiency syndromes, with an incidence of at least 1 in 200,000 births in the United States.[7](#core-r007) The clinical manifestations are listed in [Table 2](#t02). Pulmonary infection occurs in more than 80% of cases, particularly in a form of calcifying multinodular pneumonia known as encapsulating pneumonia.[7,8](#core-r007) Another common clinical manifestation is the formation of relatively painless subcutaneous nodules, known as cold abscesses, which are a classic manifestation of phagocytic dysfunction. This patient's lung and skin lesions are thus highly characteristic of chronic granulomatous disease.The diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease is often suggested by a microbiologic diagnosis, since the majority of infections in this disease are due to five catalase-producing microorganisms: *Staphylococcus aureus, B. cepacia, Serratia marcescens,* nocardia species, and aspergillus species. Aspergillus is the predominant causative agent of pulmonary infections, accounting for more than 40% of cases in which a causative organism is identified.[7](#core-r007) Aspergillus and *B. cepacia* account for many of the deaths in patients with chronic granulomatous disease.[7](#core-r007)During the course of our patient's treatment at this hospital, additional information was obtained that increased our concern for chronic granulomatous disease. Although there was no family history of immunodeficiency, we learned that the patient's parents were closely related. Consanguinity greatly increases the likelihood of an autosomal recessive disorder. In addition, the skin biopsy was interpreted as showing a possible fungal hypha, which heightened our suspicion that the patient had chronic granulomatous disease.Other causes of primary immunodeficiency are much less likely. Cystic fibrosis and ciliary defects are associated with chronic sinopulmonary disease, but they are usually associated with bronchiectasis. T-cell and B-cell immunodeficiencies can present with pneumonia, but in this case the normal immunoglobulin levels, the lack of lymphopenia, and the lack of prior recurrent infections or chronic diarrhea argue against these immunodeficiencies. Other phagocytic disorders include deficiencies in the interferon-\u03b3\u2013interleukin-12 receptor signaling pathway.[9](#core-r009) Like chronic granulomatous disease, these disorders are associated with a remarkably specific microbiology \u2014 typically mycobacterial infections or nontyphoid salmonellosis. However, these disorders are much less common than chronic granulomatous disease.\n### Diagnostic Testing\n\nTo evaluate for chronic granulomatous disease, on the fourth hospital day we sent peripheral-blood leukocytes from this patient to another laboratory for an oxidative burst assay. While this result was pending, we obtained a specimen from the involved lung tissue for histopathology and culture, which we considered essential to establishing a diagnosis.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Richard L. Kradin:* Pathological examination of a video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy specimen of the right upper lobe of the lung revealed necrotizing granulomas, primarily centered on small airways ([Figure 2A](#f02)), with extensive necrosis and dystrophic calcifications ([Figure 2B](#f02)). Special stains were negative for mycobacteria, but Gomori's methenamine silver staining ([Figure 2C](#f02)) revealed fragmented, varicose, septate hyphae with rare orthogonal pyriform conidia in areas of necrosis. The presence of fragmented varicose hyphae with small, lateral, pyriform conidiophores and conidia in tissue are typical of aspergillus of the flavipes\u2013terreus group.[10](#core-r010) A hyphal form was highlighted by immunohistochemical staining for aspergillus species. Cultures of the specimen showed no growth of fungi or bacteria, but a culture of the skin-biopsy specimen that had been obtained before admission grew *Aspergillus terreus*. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease are most commonly infected with *A. fumigatus* or *A. nidulans*.[11](#core-r011) *A. terreus* is a ubiquitous environmental fungus, which is emerging as an important pathogen in pulmonary infections in immunocompromised hosts.[12,13](#core-r012)The host response to aspergillus in this case mimics that of a mycobacterial or fungal yeast infection. Whereas invasive infections due to aspergillus species are well recognized in chronic granulomatous disease, well-defined necrotizing granulomatous inflammation is infrequent. As there was no evidence of angioinvasion in the sampled lung tissue, the infection is best classified as invasive chronic necrotizing aspergillosis, which is distinguished specifically by the absence of vascular invasion.*Dr. Ian C. Michelow:* The dihydrorhodamine assay, a quantitative measure of NADPH oxidase function during the respiratory burst of phagocytic cells, is the diagnostic test for chronic granulomatous disease. Chronic granulomatous disease is caused by mutations in genes that encode for one or more of the six components of the NADPH oxidase complex, an enzyme that is present in phagocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages and is critical to the production of the reactive oxygen species that help eradicate organisms that have been subject to phagocytosis. In our patient, the assay ([Figure 3](#f03)) showed a broad peak of fluorescence that was lower than that of normal neutrophils, a pattern typically associated with autosomal recessive variants of chronic granulomatous disease.[14](#core-r014) Assays from patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease typically demonstrate a narrow peak, with activation in response to stimulation virtually absent. Test results for the parents were normal; since a carrier of the X-linked form would be expected to have a dual population of neutrophils, some showing normal activation and others with decreased activation, this finding suggests a diagnosis of autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease.We then proceeded to genetic testing. The majority of cases of chronic granulomatous disease are due to mutations in the gene gp91 *phox,* which causes the X-linked disorder (accounting for approximately 70% of cases). Autosomal recessive cases are caused by abnormalities in the genes p47 *phox*  (approximately 20%), p22 *phox*  (approximately 5%), and p67 *phox*  (approximately 5%). Rarely, abnormalities in Rac2, a small guanosine triphosphatase, or GTPase, can cause a chronic granulomatous disease\u2013like phenotype. In this patient, sequencing of the relevant genes identified a novel missense mutation in the p22 *phox*  gene, in which lysine was substituted for glutamic acid at amino acid 129 of exon 6. The interactions among the six NADPH oxidase components are shown in [Figure 4A](#f04). [Figure 4B](#f04) shows a proposed model for p22phox topology.[15](#core-r015) An alternative model exists,[17,18](#core-r017) but there is consensus about the location of the target for p47phox binding as shown in the figure. The patient's mutation at amino acid 129 appears to affect the ability of p22phox and gp91phox to form the flavocytochrome b heterodimer (Dinauer M: personal communication), which presumably causes lack of expression of flavocytochrome b (gp91phox and p22phox complex) in neutrophils, as in most other patients with a documented p22 *phox*  mutation.The treatment of documented or suspected invasive infections in a patient such as this with chronic granulomatous disease is the same as for other immunocompromised hosts. Long-term treatment with interferon-\u03b3 has been shown to reduce the frequency of opportunistic infections, as has prophylaxis with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and itraconazole. Currently, the only widely accepted definitive treatment is bone marrow transplantation.[19,20](#core-r019)*Dr. Harris:* Unfortunately the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and a seeming Pandora's box of microbiology was opened. A blood culture obtained on hospital day 4 grew *Candida parapsilosis* at 72 hours, the skin biopsy obtained before admission grew *A. terreus* after 7 days, and blood cultures obtained on hospital days 11 through 17 were persistently positive for *B. cepacia,* despite the organism's susceptibility to meropenem, which the patient had been taking since hospital day 4. In addition to antimicrobial chemotherapy, treatment included interferon-\u03b3 and eventually a granulocyte transfusion, which was performed in the setting of sepsis and multiorgan failure. The patient died on hospital day 17, and permission for an autopsy was not obtained. The results of the genetic tests were obtained after the patient died.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Britta Panda\n(Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 43-year-old woman (a multigravida) was admitted to the labor and delivery service of this hospital at 36.4 weeks of gestation because of vaginal bleeding.\nThe patient had had regular prenatal care at this hospital; routine prenatal screening tests were negative. She had had four previous uncomplicated pregnancies, with spontaneous vaginal deliveries, the most recent 14 years earlier. She had a history of obesity (prenatal body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 32.1) and migraine headaches; she had no known allergies. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Marginal placenta previa was seen on obstetrical ultrasonography, and two episodes of bleeding occurred, at 27.7 weeks and 32.7 weeks of gestation, which resolved after the patient was admitted for bed rest, hydration, and the administration of betamethasone. She was advised to maintain bed rest at home and continue prenatal visits; the medications on discharge were iron sulfate and prenatal vitamins. At a routine prenatal visit 8 days before this presentation (at 35.3 weeks of gestation), obstetrical ultrasonography revealed an anterior placenta with the edge covering the internal os, a finding consistent with placenta previa. Heavy vaginal bleeding developed on the day of admission; the patient came to this hospital and was admitted to labor and delivery.\nOn examination in the labor and delivery unit, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal; there was active vaginal bleeding. Plans were made for emergency cesarean delivery. The hematocrit was 30.9% (reference range in women who are not pregnant, 36.0 to 46.0), the hemoglobin level was 10.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), and the ABO blood type was O, Rh-positive, with negative antibody screening; the white-cell and platelet counts were normal. A spinal anesthetic was administered, and a cesarean section was performed, with delivery of a healthy boy; the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 9, respectively. The placenta previa was removed. Twenty minutes after delivery, as the abdominal fascia was being closed, the patient's systolic blood pressure fell to 70 to 80 mm Hg, the pulse to 30 to 39 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation to 70 to 80%. The patient reported chest pain, and her lips became white; apnea developed rapidly thereafter, and she became unresponsive. Electrical activity was present on electrocardiography (ECG), but radial and carotid pulses were not palpable. The trachea was intubated, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun, with closed chest compressions and the administration of pressors.\nDiagnostic procedures were performed, and additional management decisions were made.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Jeffrey L. Ecker:* All discussants are aware of the diagnosis in this case. This healthy woman had a sudden and profound cardiorespiratory collapse in the middle of what appeared to be an uncomplicated cesarean delivery at term. Such situations require clinicians to focus promptly on a most-likely diagnosis in order to direct problem-specific therapies.\n### Causes of Sudden Intraoperative Circulatory Collapse\n\nPrimary cardiac events need to be considered as a cause of intraoperative cardiorespiratory collapse. Myocardial ischemia and infarction can cause profound alteration in vital signs, yet this patient was relatively young and had no history of heart disease, and the intraoperative cardiac monitoring did not suggest ischemic changes. Arrhythmias may also produce dramatic alterations in physiology, but the only dysrhythmia seen in this case was a bradycardia, a finding associated with what we soon determined was the likely diagnosis.Complications associated with anesthesia also need to be considered. Regional anesthesia affecting a higher spinal level than expected can cause apnea but would be unlikely to lead immediately and concomitantly to loss of respiration and cardiac output. Inadvertent intravascular injection of anesthetic agents has been associated with cardiovascular collapse; in this case, however, so much time had passed since the successful initiation of anesthesia that it seems unlikely that the subsequent events were directly linked to an anesthetic complication.Embolic events can produce sudden collapse of the sort seen in this case. There are three varieties of emboli. A thrombotic pulmonary embolus belongs in the differential diagnosis. However, formation (and migration) of a clot of the necessary size after less than 30 minutes of immobilization seems unlikely, especially since the patient was wearing intermittent pneumatic-compression stockings, as we use in all patients undergoing cesarean deliveries. Air emboli have been reported at the time of cesarean deliveries.[1](#core-r001) Although this patient had received no intravenous injections close to the time of collapse, the uterus had been exteriorized for repair of the hysterotomy; since it had been raised slightly above the level of the heart, the possibility of an air embolus cannot be entirely ruled out. Embolization of amniotic fluid and fetal material is the third type of embolic event we considered.\n### Amniotic-Fluid Embolism\n\nAmniotic-fluid embolism is thought to result from maternal reaction to fetal material entering the pulmonary circulation and can cause apnea, hypotension, and bradycardia. Amniotic-fluid embolism, although rare, is well known and feared by obstetricians, and because it seemed the most likely explanation for this patient's condition, this diagnosis will be the focus of the discussion here, as it was that day.Two analyses of administrative data report amniotic-fluid embolism as a complication in 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000 deliveries.[2,3](#core-r002) Amniotic-fluid embolisms are described in association with both vaginal and cesarean deliveries and can occur at any time during labor and delivery, as well as during the postpartum period. Risk factors for amniotic-fluid embolism include advanced maternal age, precipitous labor, cesarean delivery, and conditions associated with bleeding in pregnancy. This patient was of older maternal age, with placenta previa, and she had just undergone cesarean delivery. However, regardless of how many risk factors one patient has, each individual risk factor is relatively common, although amniotic-fluid embolism itself is quite rare; therefore, the conclusion of many observers is that amniotic-fluid embolism is unpredictable and unpreventable.The clinical presentation of amniotic-fluid embolism includes cardiovascular collapse (bradycardia or hypotension or both), apnea, bleeding, or evidence of fetal compromise (if delivery has not yet occurred). Often, as in this patient, there is a period of anxiety or agitation preceding the alteration in vital signs and physiology.[3](#core-r003)Pathophysiologically, amniotic-fluid embolism is thought to be a maternal anaphylactic reaction that unfolds in two phases. A first phase, often lasting less than 30 minutes, is marked by sudden pulmonary vasoconstriction with resulting pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. This is followed by a second phase, involving left-sided heart failure, endothelial activation and subsequent leakage, and bleeding, all probably caused in part by either the hypoxemia of the first phase or the release of injury-associated agents in the serum. It is not known why some women mount a vigorous reaction and others apparently little reaction at all. However, individual variation, including variation in the time until any response is apparent, most likely accounts for the observation that many cases of amniotic-fluid embolism occur after delivery.[4\u20137](#core-r004)Amniotic-fluid embolism poses a serious risk to a mother's life and is a leading cause of maternal death in the developed world; in a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the condition accounts for 5% of maternal deaths.[8](#core-r008) It was not so long ago that survival of an amniotic-fluid embolism merited a case report; series from the 1970s and 1980s report mortality rates associated with amniotic-fluid embolism of 50% or higher.[4](#core-r004) More recent series from both the United States and United Kingdom report mortality rates of approximately 20%.[2,3,9](#core-r002)Treatment of an amniotic-fluid embolism is supportive. As was done in this patient, the airway should be secured and supplemental oxygen delivered. Either crystalloid or blood products are used with pressors as needed to maintain blood pressure. Although volume may be needed acutely, all involved need be mindful of the second phase of amniotic-fluid embolism, in which peripheral and pulmonary edema are prevalent; central monitoring may be vital. Extraordinary measures, including cardiopulmonary bypass,[10](#core-r010) have been used to provide circulatory support and oxygen exchange when such resources are available. A final component of support in cases of amniotic-fluid embolism is treatment of bleeding due to either coagulopathy or atony. Replacement of blood products is central to treating either condition. Uterine atony should be treated first with uterotonic agents, such as ergot derivatives and prostaglandins, tamponade from an intrauterine balloon, or some combination of these. If these measures are ineffective, hysterectomy may be considered, but performing an operation on women who have this condition and have ongoing coagulopathy is itself fraught with peril.Unfortunately, there is no quick, standard confirmatory test for the diagnosis of amniotic-fluid embolism. The condition was diagnosed in the past when large amounts of fetal material were seen in a mother's lungs at the time of autopsy; it was thought that the presence of fetal material in the pulmonary circulation was always pathological.[11](#core-r011) However, pulmonary arterial-blood samples analyzed as part of studies of right heart catheterization in pregnant patients contained fetal cells more often than previously thought, and the presence of these cells did not always indicate clinical amniotic-fluid embolism.[12](#core-r012) Therefore, amniotic-fluid embolism is a clinical diagnosis that is made after ruling out other common causes for a patient's condition. It has been suggested that transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may support the diagnosis.[13](#core-r013)Our working diagnosis was amniotic-fluid embolism. The real story is in the resuscitation and the support that an institution like this one can provide to optimize the outcome in an individual patient. We quickly asked for help, and help quickly came. At the outset, I want to recognize that many people participated in this patient's care. Not all will speak today, but that in no way diminishes their vital contributions.*Dr. Ken Solt:* Approximately 20 minutes after delivery of the neonate, as the abdominal fascia was being closed, the patient had an acute onset of bradycardia. Over the course of 1 minute, her heart rate decreased from 81 beats per minute to 42 beats per minute ([Figure 1](#f01)). During cesarean section, a sudden increase in vagal tone may occur in response to manipulation of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries, resulting in acute bradycardia. However, this patient had bradycardia during closure of the abdominal fascia. Occasionally, a patient may have a vasovagal response to the stress of undergoing a major operation while awake, but this patient initially appeared well despite the bradycardia. We administered glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg intravenously), but the heart rate continued to decrease, into the 30s. The patient then reported pain and clutched her chest. Her eyes rolled back, her lips turned white, and she rapidly became unresponsive and apneic. We administered succinylcholine and performed a rapid-sequence intubation. No end-tidal carbon dioxide was detected by a capnograph, despite clear bilateral breath sounds. Despite electrical activity on the ECG, the patient had no palpable radial or carotid pulses. Chest compressions were initiated and epinephrine (1 mg intravenously) was administered. Although the blood pressure was initially restored, she rapidly became hypotensive and pulseless again and required a second dose of epinephrine (1 mg intravenously). Because of the wide swings in blood pressure associated with the administration of bolus doses, we started the patient on an epinephrine infusion for further hemodynamic support.A subclavian central venous catheter and a radial arterial catheter were placed. The first arterial blood gas measurement was recorded approximately 20 minutes after the initial arrest. This revealed a large gap between the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (Paco2) (48 mm Hg) and the end-tidal carbon dioxide (18 mm Hg). When both the Paco2 and the end-tidal carbon dioxide are known, one may calculate an estimate of the fraction of dead space using the Bohr equation.[14](#core-r014) Under normal conditions, approximately 10% of the tidal volume is dead space, representing the anatomical dead space (i.e., the volume of the tracheobronchial tree, which does not participate in gas exchange). In this patient, the calculated dead space was 62.5% of the tidal volume, implying a large component of alveolar dead space (i.e., 50% of the alveoli were ventilated but not perfused). The end-tidal carbon dioxide of 0 at the time of intubation indicated that the patient's entire pulmonary system was dead space during the initial arrest.In this patient with the sudden onset of bradycardia, chest pain, loss of consciousness, and apnea during cesarean delivery, performed because of bleeding placenta previa, the finding of 100% pulmonary dead space in the context of cardiac arrest presenting as pulseless electrical activity rapidly led us to the preliminary diagnosis of an amniotic-fluid embolism. We performed TEE to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nDiagnostic Discussion\n---------------------\n\n*Dr. Michael G. Fitzsimons:* Emergency TEE was performed by the cardiac anesthesia service ([Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C](#f02); and [Videos 1, 2, and 3](#v01), available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org), and it revealed a dilated right atrium with a shift of the interatrial septum toward the left, severe tricuspid valve insufficiency, mild-to-moderate pulmonary insufficiency, and shifting of the interventricular septum toward the left during systole, resulting in the classic D-shaped left ventricle. The cavity of the left ventricle appeared small. Over time, the right ventricle became more hypokinetic, with bulging of the free wall. There was no evidence of aortic dissection, clot in the proximal pulmonary artery, patent foramen ovale, or pericardial effusion.TEE is a quick, portable, and reliable means of identifying the potential causes of hemodynamic collapse during labor and delivery. Amniotic-fluid embolism causes intense pulmonary vasoconstriction and an acute pressure overload on the right ventricle, leading to dilatation and hypokinesis. Tricuspid regurgitation leads to dilatation of the right atrium and a shift of the interatrial septum toward the left. Hypotension results from impaired filling of the left ventricle associated with pulmonary vasoconstriction and a shift of the interventricular septum toward the left, resulting in the classic D shape seen in transgastric images. The left ventricle initially appears small and underfilled but hyperkinetic. Worsening left ventricular function may be due to hypoxemia and ischemia. Dilatation of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary regurgitation further support the diagnosis of amniotic-fluid embolism. Several case reports[10,13,15\u201319](#core-r010) have documented such TEE findings at the time of presumed amniotic-fluid embolism ([Table 1](#t01)).The utility of TEE in acute cardiopulmonary collapse associated with labor and delivery is not limited to diagnosis but may also include management, the evaluation of the placement of venous and arterial cannulae for extracorporeal membranous oxygenation, the placement and effect of intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, or the effects of inotropic agents.\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Thomas E. MacGillivray:* When I arrived in the obstetrics suite, a well-coordinated resuscitation was under way. The patient was receiving infusions of high-dose vasoactive agents and intermittent chest compressions to maintain a palpable pulse and blood pressure. Owing to the echocardiographic findings of right ventricular distention and an underfilled left ventricle, combined with the marginal hemodynamic status, we decided to proceed with mechanical circulatory support.\n### Mechanical Circulatory Support\n\nNumerous devices can support the cardiopulmonary circulation. Percutaneous devices that can be expeditiously inserted include the intraaortic balloon pump, the Impella pump (Abiomed), and the TandemHeart (CardiacAssist). These devices support the failing left ventricle, but because they do little to support the right ventricle or pulmonary circulation, we did not think they would be appropriate for this patient.Traditional ventricular assist devices can be used to support the left ventricle, right ventricle, or both. Implantation is performed in the operating room; the pumps are usually implanted through a sternotomy and with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. These pumps are not ideal in situations such as this one, in which active resuscitation is under way, unless you can quickly get the patient to a cardiac-surgery operating room and rapidly initiate cardiopulmonary bypass. Although they can completely replace the pumping function of either or both ventricles, these pumps do not provide any respiratory support or gas exchange, which was a major issue for this patient.\n### Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation\n\nWe chose to initiate extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in this patient.[20](#core-r020) The two types of ECMO are venovenous ECMO and venoarterial ECMO. Venovenous ECMO is essentially lung support. Cannulae are placed through the femoral vein and through the internal jugular vein. One cannula removes the deoxygenated blood, which is pumped through a membrane oxygenator. The oxygenated blood is then pumped back in through a cannula in the vena cava. The right ventricle must pump the oxygenated blood through the lungs, and the left ventricle pumps the blood through the systemic circulation.We chose venoarterial ECMO, which is essentially a heart\u2013lung machine without a reservoir, to provide both respiratory and circulatory support. We used the Seldinger technique[21](#core-r021) and quickly obtained access to both the left femoral artery and the right femoral vein with guidewires. A heparin bolus increased the activated clotting time to more than 180 seconds. An 18-French arterial catheter was introduced over one guidewire into the femoral artery, and a 25-French venous cannula was directed through the femoral vein into the right atrium over the other guidewire, with the assistance of TEE. With the initiation of ECMO, 4 liters per minute of blood could flow, which provided excellent support of the patient's circulation such that most of the vasoactive medications could be discontinued, and we could provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation.The duration of ECMO support in an adult is best limited to hours or days, although it has been effectively used for several weeks. Given the likely diagnosis of an amniotic-fluid embolism, we predicted that the patient's cardiopulmonary system would recover quickly. We moved the patient from the obstetrics suite to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Initially, she was hemodynamically stable, but later she showed signs of hemorrhagic shock. She had large amounts of vaginal bleeding due to uterine atony. She also had abdominal distention that we initially presumed was due to bleeding from the cesarean section. Exploration of her abdomen and pelvis revealed that, in addition to bleeding from the uterus, she also had lacerations of the liver, most likely from cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A hysterectomy was performed for the uterine bleeding, and the liver hemorrhage was controlled by packing with gauze. As predicted, the hemodynamics, gas exchange, and right ventricular function improved overnight, and we were able to discontinue ECMO the next day.*Dr. Fitzsimons:* Midesophageal TEE views obtained after 24 hours of ECMO support showed that the right ventricle had returned to its normal anatomy. Tricuspid regurgitation was reduced from severe to mild ([Figure 2D](#f02) and [Video 4](#v01)). TEE images obtained during weaning of the ECMO circuit showed further improvement in right and left ventricular function. Transgastric TEE images showed a normal position of the interventricular septum.*Dr. William D. Hoffman* (Surgery): The patient's ICU course was complicated by medical events that were a consequence of her initial cardiac arrest, subsequent surgeries, and bleeding. Acute nonoliguric renal failure developed, which required continuous venovenous hemofiltration. The causes of this complication are multifactorial and include renal hypoperfusion and administration of an aminoglycoside antibiotic, which was exchanged for another antibiotic early in the patient's stay in the ICU. The patient was sufficiently awake that we could extubate and remove mechanical ventilation support 7 days after admission.The patient awoke with an encephalopathy characterized by lack of speech, intact language comprehension, intact nonverbal expression, normal cranial-nerve function, and normal motor and sensory functions. The symptoms could not be attributed to an infarct in the territory of a major cerebral artery. Brain CT revealed no hemorrhage or infarct. Her speech returned to normal during the next 10 days. She was discharged from the ICU 13 days after admission.*Dr. Ecker:* I met this patient only briefly on the morning of delivery. I have subsequently seen her several times and had many conversations with her, which was not something I expected given the initial events. She left the hospital after 32 days and was readmitted very briefly 2 weeks later for a pleural effusion, which resolved. Her baby is healthy.*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): Are there any questions?*A Physician:* If initial severe vasoconstriction in the pulmonary vasculature is a trigger for the other events, are there other agents, such as prostaglandins or sildenafil, that might address this pathophysiological feature?*Dr. MacGillivray:* The pathophysiological features of pulmonary emboli are fascinating. The profound right ventricular dysfunction seems to be caused by more than just a mechanical obstruction of the pulmonary artery. In thoracic surgery, we can clamp a large branch of the pulmonary artery without circulatory collapse. However, with a pulmonary embolism, there is frequently a severe, diffuse pulmonary vasoconstriction in addition to the mechanical obstruction. Perhaps rapid initiation of a selective pulmonary arterial relaxant, such as nitric oxide, might be beneficial.*Dr. Ecker:* One week after this conference, the patient was readmitted to the hospital with multiple pulmonary emboli. A source of the emboli was never identified. The patient was given anticoagulant agents and was discharged after 2 days. She remains well more than 1 year later.\n",

      "question": "A 58-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of recurrent left pleural effusions.\nHe was well until 10 months previously, when pain developed in the left side of the chest accompanied by a nonproductive cough, anorexia and loss of weight. Three months later the symptoms worsened, and he entered another hospital. Atrial fibrillation was found. X-ray films of the chest showed blunting of the left costophrenic angle, believed to result primarily from scarring; a small amount of pleural fluid was evident on lateral decubitus projections. A tuberculin skin test was positive. Six months before admission he returned to the same hospital for elective cardioversion of the atrial fibrillation. The maneuver was unsuccessful, and digoxin was begun. X-ray films of the chest demonstrated nearly complete disappearance of the left pleural effusion; an infiltrate was observed in the lingula. Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination disclosed no abnormality. Microscopical examination of specimens obtained by bronchial brushing and bronchial washings revealed no tumor cells or pathogenic micro-organisms, including tubercle bacilli.\nDuring the next few months the patient appeared to improve, but 2 1/2 months before admission left pleuritic pain recurred. Five weeks before entry he returned to the same hospital, where x-ray films of the chest disclosed a recurrent left pleural effusion; an infiltrative density was again seen within the lingula. A thoracentesis yielded 500 ml of cloudy, yellow fluid; microscopical examination of the pleural fluid and of a pleural-biopsy specimen showed no evidence of malignant tumor cells or tubercle bacilli; cytologic examination of the fluid was negative for tumor cells. Bronchoscopic examination and a left bronchographic study were negative. He was referred to this hospital.\nThe patient had lost 9 kg in weight during the 10 months before entry. He had worked for many years as an aluminum machinist and gave a history of exposure in childhood to tuberculosis in a family member. There was a 28-pack-year history of cigarette smoking. A left iliofemoral bypass graft was performed six years before admission; an x-ray film of the chest obtained at that time was normal. There was no history of fever or hemoptysis.\nThe temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the pulse 60, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 90/50 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared lethargic and cachectic. There were signs of consolidation and crepitant rales at the base of the left lung. The heart was slightly enlarged, the rhythm was irregular, and a Grade 3 systolic ejection murmur was audible along the left sternal border, without radiation; no pericardial friction rub was heard. The abdomen was normal. There was + digital clubbing, without cyanosis or peripheral edema.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 33.2 per cent; the white-cell count was 5700, with 64 per cent neutrophils, 29 per cent lymphocytes, 4 per cent monocytes, 1 per cent eosinophils and 2 per cent basophils. The reticulocyte count was 2.9 per cent, and the platelet count 550,000; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 76 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg, the glucose 77 mg, the bilirubin 0.3 mg, the calcium 7.8 mg, the phosphorus 4.1 mg, and the protein 6.4 g (the albumin 2.3 g, and the globulin 4.1 g) per 100 ml. The glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) was 11 U, the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 155 U, the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 7 U, the alkaline phosphatase 8.7 Bodansky U, and the 5\u2032 nucleotidase 2.3 Bodansky U. An electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial fibrillation at a ventricular rate of 60, with a mean QRS axis of +30\u00b0; there were ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. X-ray films of the chest (\nFig. 1\n) disclosed a large left pleural effusion that had increased in size in comparison with films taken before admission; the heart shadow was enlarged and displaced slightly to the right; a rounded opacity was evident within the lingula, and a linear scar was seen overlying the apex of the heart; the right lung and the bony thorax appeared normal. Microscopical and cytologic examination of an aspirated specimen of pleural fluid disclosed no evidence of tumor cells; a needle-aspiration biopsy of the pleura was negative. Pulmonary-function studies revealed a mild obstructive defect and a moderate restrictive defect. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing room air, disclosed that the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO\n2\n) was 81 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO\n2\n) 37 mm Hg, and the pH 7.43. A\n99m\nTc diethylene triamic pentacetic acid brain scan was normal. A\n99m\nTc sulfur colloid liver-spleen scan showed minimal enlargement of the liver with normal uptake and a homogeneous distribution; the spleen appeared normal. A\n99m\nTc methylene diphosphonate bone scan disclosed no evidence of focal disease. An echocardiogram revealed that the left atrium was enlarged, and the leaflets of the mitral valve appeared abnormal, raising the possibility of mitral-valve prolapse; there was no evidence of a pericardial effusion. Serum immuno-electrophoresis demonstrated a moderate increase in IgG and a mild increase in IgA; IgM appeared normal. Agarose-gel electrophoresis showed a decrease in albumin, a mild increase in alpha globulin and a moderate, diffuse increase in gamma globulin. Cytologic examination of two specimens of sputum showed no tumor cells. A culture of sputum yielded a normal throat flora.\nOn the 12th hospital day bronchoscopic examination showed no abnormality; specimens of the bronchial washings were obtained. A left-sided thoracotomy yielded 900 ml of straw-colored fluid. The pleura appeared normal, as did the lung except for old fibronodular disease with adhesions at the left-lung apex. The medial aspect of the left lower lobe and the lingula were densely adherent to the pericardium and were pulsatile in the vicinity of the left ventricle. A ventricular aneurysm was suspected, and no further exploration of this area was carried out. A biopsy specimen of the pleura adjacent to the thoracotomy incision was obtained; no tumor cells were found in the pleura or the pleural fluid. On the 17th hospital day a\n99m\nTc human serum albumin gated cardiac scan disclosed that the size and contraction of the left ventricle appeared normal; the right ventricle was slightly enlarged, with normal contractions; there was no evidence of a ventricular aneurysm. On the following day cardiac catheterization revealed that the aortic pressure was 125/65 mm Hg, the left ventricular pressure 100/15 mm Hg, the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure 28/14 mm Hg, the pulmonary arterial pressure 36/12 mm Hg, the right ventricular pressure 38/8 mm Hg, and the right atrial pressure 10 mm Hg. A right atrial angiographic examination disclosed rigidity of the right atrial border. A coronary angiographic examination disclosed rigidity of the right atrial border. A coronary angiographic examination demonstrated right dominance with a normal appearance; contraction of the left ventricle appeared normal; there was a suggestion of rapid diastolic filling, a pattern believed consistent with constrictive pericardial disease.\nOn the 20th hospital day a repeated echocardiographic examination revealed that the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve had a generous excursion; the posterior leaflet moved with the anterior leaflet throughout the cardiac cycle, raising the question of ruptured chordae tendineae; there was no evidence of free pericardial fluid. On the following day repeated x-ray films of the chest showed an area of increased density at the base of the left lung that obscured the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe superimposed on a large left pleural effusion; an area of increased density was also noted in the left perihilar region; the right lung appeared normal except for blunting of the right costophrenic angle; the heart was enlarged, with a double density along the right heart border consistent with enlargement of the left atrium.\nOn the 25th hospital day an operation was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Edward A. Gaensler[\\*](#FN1): May we review the x-ray films now?Dr. Reginald E. Greene: A film of the chest obtained seven months before admission shows blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus and loss of volume at the base of the left lung. Small focal densities are visible in the apexes, probably representing scarring from previous tuberculosis. There is an area of ill defined increased density in the region of the central portion of the left mid-lung. A decubitus view demonstrates a thin rim of free-flowing pleural fluid, approximately 4 mm thick, extending along the lateral chest wall. The left main-stem bronchus and the take-off of the lower-lobe bronchus appear normal; the upper-lobe bronchi are not well seen. The left atrium appears slightly enlarged. A film obtained one month later demonstrates the diaphragm in a lower position, with continued effacement of the left costophrenic sulcus, slight fullness in the region of the left atrium and a density in the region of the lingula along the major fissure. There is no longer evidence of a pleural effusion. Films of the chest taken five weeks before admission demonstrate recurrent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, evidence of left pleural fluid and a slightly more prominent lingular density. The cardiac silhouette seems larger than on the previous study, with a suggestion of slight enlargement of the left atrium. An x-ray film of the chest taken just before admission shows an increase in the amount of left pleural fluid. The left-lower-lung field is opacified and obscured by the overlying pulmonary and pleural densities. The displacement of the right lateral margin of the heart farther to the right appears to be the result of the increased left pleural field.The films from the first x-ray examination after admission ([Fig. 1](#f001)), taken on the second hospital day, demonstrate an increase in the left pleural fluid, a band of scarring or platelike atelectasis and a uniform opacity in the region of the lingula. The remaining parts of the left upper lung and the right lung are unchanged, and the cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. A decubitus view discloses that the pleural effusion was free-flowing. The left main-stem bronchus is patent, but the more peripheral portions of the bronchial tree are not visualized.Dr. Gaensler: We are presented with a male cigarette smoker over the age of 50 years with a 10-month history of left-sided chest pain, anorexia, a 9-kg weight loss and a lingular infiltrate. He also had recurrent pleural effusions, which for lack of specific information I assume were exudates that did not have eosinophils, an increased viscosity suggesting the presence of hyaluronidase or a low or absent sugar content. In addition, he had clubbing of the fingers and appeared lethargic and cachectic. He was bronchoscoped three times, with normal findings, and examination of bronchial washings and brushings was negative for tumor cells and tuberculosis. Since only two thoracenteses were performed during the 10 months the accumulation of fluid apparently was intermittent or slow; the fluid was cloudy once and did not contain tumor cells or acid-fast bacilli. Two closed pleural biopsies were negative, as were all the other laboratory studies except for some suggesting a debilitating illness and perhaps a slightly damaged liver. The patient also had asymptomatic heart disease. The most impressive cardiac findings were atrial fibrillation and left atrial enlargement, which was demonstrated on the x-ray films and confirmed by echocardiographic and angiocardiographic examination. Other studies revealed slight or nonspecific changes. He had a systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border, suggesting mitral regurgitation, and that finding was confirmed by the echocardiographic study, which demonstrated an abnormal mitral valve with a possibility of prolapse and ruptured chordae tendineae.Exploratory thoracotomy revealed a pulsating mass anteriorly at the left-lung base thought to be a ventricular aneurysm. The record does not make it clear why an aneurysm was suspected because any mass or atelectatic segment adherent to the heart must pulsate as forcefully as the heart itself. Furthermore, in this country a ventricular aneurysm almost invariably is related to myocardial infarction, but this man did not have a history suggestive of that diagnosis, there was no evidence of a previous infarct in the electrocardiogram, and the coronary angiographic study was negative. A pericardial incision and biopsy above the adherent lesion might have been of interest and might have permitted palpation of the pericardial space and perhaps intrapericardial freeing of the mass. A pleural biopsy adjacent to the incision revealed neither a granuloma nor a tumor. Additional studies after the thoracotomy included a gated cardiac scan, which demonstrated normal size and contractility of the left ventricle and perhaps slight right ventricular enlargement. Cardiac catheterization suggested minimal aortic stenosis and slight pulmonary hypertension. We are not told whether the left ventricular angiograms disclosed regurgitation through the mitral valve. The coronary angiograms showed good left ventricular contraction, excluding a myopathy. There was rapid diastolic filling suggestive of constrictive pericardial disease, but several of the studies excluded the presence of pericardial fluid.In making a diagnosis one would like to put all the findings together to fit the pattern of a single disease. That is the wisest approach in young patients, but there are more often multiple problems in those who are older. For example, this patient had peripheral vascular disease with an iliofemoral bypass graft, but it was an unrelated problem, especially since the coronary arteries were normal. He also had tuberculosis, as indicated by the history of exposure in childhood, the positive tuberculin skin test, the demonstration of apical scarring on x-ray films and the nodular lesions found at exploration. It is tempting to propose that tuberculosis was responsible for all the problems, particularly since it is estimated that the infection is due to reactivation in 90 per cent of affected adults.[1](#core-r001) However, the bronchoscopic study revealed no endobronchial disease, and examination of multiple sputum specimens and pleural-fluid washings was negative on smear and presumably on culture. There were hints of constrictive pericarditis in the cardiac work-up, but it was not evident clinically. The patient did not have exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, cervical-vein distention or a Kussmaul sign, and there probably was no congestive hepatomegaly or ascites. Furthermore, none of the findings from the sophisticated noninvasive and invasive cardiac examinations supported this diagnosis. I conclude that the patient had healed tuberculosis, unrelated to the recent problem.Other disorders that might produce both the cardiac and the pulmonary manifestations described in this case record merit brief consideration. A functioning carcinoid tumor in the lung could account for the pulmonary lesion, and by secreting serotonin into the left side of the heart it could result in damage to the mitral and aortic valves rather than the pulmonic and tricuspid valves, which are typically affected in cases of abdominal carcinoid.[2](#core-r002) A pulmonary carcinoid is unlikely for several reasons, however. Eighty per cent of them arise centrally, unlike this lesion, 90 per cent are found in patients less than 50 years of age, and usually there is hemoptysis.[3,4](#core-r003) A more important objection is that patients with functioning pulmonary carcinoids and left-sided cardiac lesions generally have obvious distant metastases, with flushing, diarrhea and hypotension.[2,5](#core-r002) Among 40 such patients with the \"left-heart syndrome\" I found only one who did not have metastases.[6](#core-r006)A number of other disorders with both pulmonary and cardiac manifestations can be easily dismissed. Myocardial disease may occur in certain syndromes associated with eosinophilia. There was no history of asthma or rhinitis, however, and the patient did not have eosinophilia, although both features may be absent.[7](#core-r007) Furthermore, pleural effusion is rare in these conditions, and the abnormal shadow in the lung was not typical of such a lesion.[7](#core-r007) Sarcoidosis, like tuberculosis, may present with almost any pulmonary radiographic picture, but an effusion occurs in less than 1 per cent of the cases.[8](#core-r008) Pericardial involvement, according to my experience, is very common, and atrial fibrillation may occur. Lastly, pleural, pulmonary and cardiac lesions may result from exposure to asbestos. The possibility of a mesothelioma deserves mention in this case, but a more complete exposure history would be necessary to discuss it further. In our outpatient consultation practice, which deals largely with unresolved problems, 13 per cent of all pleural effusions have proved to be related to exposure to asbestos.[9](#core-r009)The best approach to the diagnosis in this case is one fortified by statistical probability. On that basis, both initially and throughout the course the tentative diagnosis must be bronchogenic carcinoma. Indeed, when one is told of an abnormality demonstrable on x-ray films of the chest in a man over the age of 50 years with a history of smoking, even without inspection of x-ray films a diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma will prove correct in over half the cases. That was true even 20 years ago, when we reviewed 22,000 films of various groups of employees in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Also, in 53 per cent of 436 patients with a pleural effusion studied in the post-tuberculosis era the cause proved to be a malignant tumor,[10](#core-r010) and 8 to 15 per cent of all the patients with a bronchogenic carcinoma have been reported to have a pleural effusion.[11,12](#core-r011) Finally, the presence of a chronic debilitating illness of relatively recent onset with a weight loss of 9 kg in a lethargic, cachectic and afebrile patient strongly favors the diagnosis of cancer rather than a benign pulmonary lesion, infection or primary heart disease.This patient was studied extensively, expensively and presumably sometimes painfully during several admissions to at least two hospitals. Several of the investigations were dictated by \"routine,\" and others were directed at minor imperfections that come with advancing age. Are there any procedures that could have been performed on an outpatient basis and directed more specifically at the statistically most likely diagnosis \u2014 namely, an inoperable bronchogenic carcinoma? Transbronchial lung biopsy was first described 13 years ago,[13](#core-r013) but it has been widely used only since the introduction of the fiberoptic bronchoscope.[14](#core-r014) The procedure adds little to the mortality rate of bronchoscopic study, and the morbidity from bleeding and pneumothorax is slight.[14\u201316](#core-r014) In this case there were no contraindications, such as severe hypoxemia or pulmonary hypertension. Transbronchial biopsy has a higher yield than bronchial brushing and results in a diagnosis in about 85 per cent of the cases of a distal obstructive lesion.[14](#core-r014) This procedure, performed under fluoroscopic guidance, probably would have been diagnostic in this case. A tomographic study also might have been useful to delineate the mass and demonstrate possible mediastinal involvement. A Nordenstr\u00f6m type of transthoracic needle-aspiration biopsy[17](#core-r017) could have been performed, and a mediastinoscopic examination might have been considered by some authorities.[18](#core-r018)Some features that are unusual for the diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma are easily explained. Cytologic examination of pleural fluid is negative in almost half the cases,[19](#core-r019) either because implants may not shed or because the effusion may result from distal atelectasis and infection, from irritation of the pleura by the peripheral lesion itself or from lymphatic obstruction by involved lymph nodes.[20](#core-r020) Whatever the immediate cause of the effusion, its appearance almost always signifies inoperability.[20,21](#core-r020) A negative bronchoscopic examination also is not unusual if the tumor has arisen distal to the third or fourth order of bronchi. Cardiac involvement is more common than is generally recognized in patients with cancer, particularly those with carcinoma of the breast or lung. For example, among 205 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma 98 were reported to have an arrhythmia, which caused death in 22 of those cases.[22](#core-r022) All the cardiac features described in this case record have occurred in association with bronchogenic carcinoma, although apparently only in patients with widespread metastases to a number of organs. Such metastases were apparently absent in this case. Secondary tumors that become attached to the endocardium and then invade the myocardium are occasionally encountered, although that pathway is usually the one for tumors originating in the kidneys or adrenal glands. On statistical grounds, therefore, I believe that this patient had bronchogenic carcinoma with unrelated asymptomatic heart disease.Dr. Homayoun Kazem: I concur with Dr. Gaensler's diagnosis, particularly in view of the density shown on the x-ray films of the chest and the presence of a pleural effusion in a man over the age of 50 years who smoked. One has to be a little cautious, however, in view of all the negative preoperative studies.Dr. Gaensler: This patient did not have wide-spread pleural implants. Otherwise, the surgical pleural biopsy and probably also some of the needle biopsies would have shown tumor. The primary lesion was peripheral and presumably associated with an inflammatory process. The resulting pleural lesion must have been small, so that fluid developed slowly. Finally, the lesion could have become walled off, resulting in resorption of pleural fluid.Dr. Kazemi: Dr. Gaensler, will you comment about the relation of industrial exposure, in particular to asbestos, to the development of a pleural effusion? Do you have any guidelines to use when there is a large effusion?Dr. Gaensler: We know little about the occupational history in this case. Aluminum machining is harmless. Indeed, many years ago inhalation of aluminum powder was recommended for the treatment of silicosis. A much more detailed occupational history would be required to evaluate the role of asbestos in this case because the pleural consequences of asbestos exposure may result from only very slight contact. Pleural plaques, calcifications, asbestos effusion and a mesothelioma have all been reported in relatives whose only contact was with the workers' clothes, in persons living near asbestos plants, shipyards or mines and in persons who used asbestos products only while building their own homes.We define as asbestos effusion the presence of fluid confirmed by thoracentesis or serial roentgenograms of the chest in a patient who has had a definite exposure to asbestos, however brief or slight, if the patient also has a negative tuberculin test and no evidence of a disease that may be associated with an effusion and if a malignant tumor does not appear within three years.[9](#core-r009) Asbestos effusions have now been described in several other countries.[23\u201325](#core-r023) The frequency of its development among 887 exposed workers whom we have followed for four to 10 years has ranged from 5.6 per cent among long-term pipe coverers and asbestos-products workers to 3.4 per cent among long-term shipfitters with neighborhood exposure only; no asbestos effusions occurred in 170 paper workers minimally exposed for less than seven years. The effusions occurred bilaterally, either simultaneously or, more often, asynchronously, in 55 per cent of the cases, and they were sanguineous or serosanguineous in 64 per cent. Asbestos bodies were seen in the adjacent lung whenever such tissue was available but were found only rarely in the pleura.Dr. Randall M. Zusman: The medical students considered a number of diagnoses and agreed with Dr. Gaensler that bronchogenic carcinoma was the first choice. They also thought that tuberculosis was high on the list and discussed the possibilities of lymphoma, mesothelioma, primary pericardial disease, rheumatoid lung disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. They believed that the diagnostic procedure was a thoracotomy, with biopsy of the lung or pericardium, or both.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Eugene J. Mark: The second operation was a repeated left thoracotomy. The surgeon noted again the old fibrous adhesions at the apex but found a slightly different appearance in the lower portion of the thorax from that encountered at the earlier thoracotomy. The adhesions were more extensive, involving the medial, inferior and lateral surfaces of the pleura of the left lower lobe and extending focally to the pericardial fat pad. A biopsy of the pleural adhesion adjacent to the pericardium was performed.The pleura was infiltrated by carcinoma ([Fig. 2](#f002)). The tumor cells formed solid nests ([Fig. 3](#f003)) and abortive glands. Mucin, which stained positively with both mucicarmine and the periodic-acid-Schiff technic after predigestion with diastase, was present within the cytoplasm of the tumor cells as well as within the lumens of the glands. Alcian-blue staining gave a strikingly positive reaction in the fibrous stroma of the tumor. This demonstration of acid mucopolysaccharides must be interpreted carefully. Mesothelial cells and mesotheliomas characteristically produce acid mucopolysaccharides \u2014 in particular, hyaluronic acid. Their detection in the cytoplasm of the cells of a mesothelioma that resemble epithelial cells may be of diagnostic value,[26,27](#core-r026) but their presence within the non-neoplastic stroma is not. The most useful histochemical reaction in excluding a mesothelioma is the periodic-acid-Schiff reaction for neutral mucopolysaccharides, which are absent in the cytoplasm of the cells of a mesothelioma.[28](#core-r028)The carcinoma in this case filled subpleural lymphatics and infiltrated between collagen and elastic fibers of the pleura. However, the tumor cells did not extend onto the pleural surface. This growth pattern explains why the pleural surface was relatively smooth and not suggestive of a malignant tumor at the first thoracotomy. The interruption of the pleural lymphatic drainage by tumor without surface tumor also accounts for the absence of cytologically detectable malignant tumor cells in the pleural effusion. Even on retrospective examination the cytologic smears were negative for tumor. Peripheral lung cancer, which disseminates principally via subpleural lymphatics, has been termed pseudomesotheliomatous carcinoma of the lung.[29](#core-r029) In this case extension from the pericardial pleura into the inferior pericardium resulted in a thickened and firm pericardium, which transmitted cardiac pulsation and mimicked a left ventricular aneurysm.The patient did well postoperatively. He was discharged and treated with palliative radiotherapy.Dr. James T. Heyl: Chemotherapists are increasingly interested in histologic subtyping of lung tumors. How often do pathologists have difficulty in classifying thoracic neoplasms?Dr. Mark: The pathologist can usually distinguish a mesothelioma from a carcinoma if there is more than a very small biopsy specimen with which to work. The majority of squamous-cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas and small-cell undifferentiated carcinomas also present little problem. Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma is usually distinctive. In approximately 10 to 20 per cent of lung carcinomas, however, the best diagnosis that the pathologist can make is large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma. More extensive sampling at autopsy will disclose that some of these tumors are actually poorly differentiated squamous-cell carcinomas or adenocarcinomas, but some can never be typed precisely. Large-cell undifferentiated carcinomas are subdivided into four categories by the World Health Organization,[30](#core-r030) but such histopathological finesse does not yet have a clinical correlation. Electromicroscopical examination is useful in confirming a diagnosis of mesothelioma or oat-cell carcinoma but is of less value in identifying the cell of origin in large-cell undifferentiated carcinomas.Dr. Arthur S. Pier, Jr.: Do you think that smoking was the cause of the tumor, or was it entirely unrelated to it?Dr. Mark: Although peripheral adenocarcinoma is not as highly associated with cigarette smoking as the carcinomas arising in the more central bronchi, most statistics suggest that all lung carcinomas are related to cigarette smoking to some degree.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Katharina Busl\n(Neurology): A 30-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of progressive neurologic deficits.\nApproximately 1 year before this admission, he began to have intermittent headaches and the gradual onset of difficulty with word finding and writing, without changes in cognition, memory or personality, or sensorimotor deficits. Ten months before this admission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, performed after the administration of gadolinium, showed enhancement of the genu and rostrum of the corpus callosum, and T\n2\n-weighted signal abnormality in the white matter and cortex of the left frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. He was admitted at that time to the neurology service of this hospital.\nWhen the patient was 26 years old, fever, fatigue, painful oral and genital ulcers, arthralgias, and erythematous nodular skin lesions on the shins had developed. He had been treated with immunosuppressive agents, including colchicine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. Oral ulcers persisted, and two episodes of scleral injection without ocular symptoms occurred. Biopsy specimens of cutaneous lesions obtained approximately 2 years after his initial presentation revealed a superficial and deep lymphocytic infiltrate, perineural inflammation, mucin deposition, and lymphocytic vasculitis. Testing for antinuclear antibodies and hepatitis B and C virus infection was negative. Approximately 6 months before the onset of neurologic symptoms, methotrexate (12.5 mg weekly) was begun and increased to 25 mg weekly over a period of 3 to 4 months; his skin lesions and arthritis improved, and the dose of prednisone was reduced. The patient was of Korean ancestry, had been born in the United States, worked in an office, and was married with no children. He did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. His mother had hypertension and his father and brother were well. There was no family history of neurologic or rheumatologic disease.\nOn examination during that admission, his speech was fluent with occasional circumlocution and semantic paraphasic errors, there was flattening of the right nasolabial fold, reflexes were 2 out of 4 throughout, and the plantar responses were flexor; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory testing revealed a white-cell count of 13,600 cells per cubic millimeter (96% neutrophils, 3% lymphocytes, and 1% monocytes). Results of other routine hematologic tests; tests of coagulation, renal function, and liver function; the level of C-reactive protein; electrolyte levels; and a toxicology screen were normal. Lumbar puncture was performed; results of the cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in\nTable 1\n. No oligoclonal bands or malignant cells were seen, and flow cytometry disclosed no abnormal cells; cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid and blood and testing for infectious agents (including cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, JC virus, and herpes simplex virus [HSV] type 1 and type 2 by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) and for cryptococcal antigen, Lyme antibody, and syphilis were negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the head with venography showed no evidence of venous obstruction.\nTreatment with infliximab (5 mg per kilogram of body weight every 4 weeks for three doses, and every 6 weeks thereafter) was begun; within 1 month after the first dose, language difficulties resolved and cerebrospinal fluid findings (\nTable 1\n) and the signal abnormalities seen on T\n2\n-weighted MRI of the brain improved. However, 4 weeks after the fourth dose and 5.5 months before this admission, a generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure occurred, followed by status epilepticus and a temperature of 40\u00b0C; he was readmitted to this hospital. Antiepileptic agents and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents were administered, and the seizure activity abated. CT and MRI of the brain after the administration of contrast material showed new areas of abnormal T\n2\n-weighted signal intensity in both temporal lobes and the left frontal lobe that involved white and gray matter. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed diffuse slowing of delta and theta waves, with no spikes or sharp-wave activity. Tests for the human immunodeficiency virus, antinuclear antibodies, antibodies to double-stranded DNA, and antibodies to the Ro, La, Sm, and U1-RNP nuclear antigens were negative. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in\nTable 1\n. All cultures were sterile, and antibiotics were discontinued. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid for varicella\u2013zoster virus, human herpesvirus 6, and enterovirus with the use of PCR was negative. Another dose of infliximab was administered, and the patient was discharged on the seventh day with mild residual aphasia and taking valproic acid and phenytoin.\nAfter the patient was discharged, infliximab and methotrexate were discontinued, and therapy with pegylated interferon alfa was initiated. Valproic acid and phenytoin were discontinued because of a skin rash, and oxcarbazepine was begun. Three months before admission, seizures and fevers recurred and right hemiparesis developed. His language, affect, mood, cognitive function, behavior, and ability to interact deteriorated, and he was unable to work. MRI of the brain 3 weeks before admission revealed new white-matter changes in the internal capsule on the right, increased multifocal left hemispheric white-matter changes, stable encephalomalacia of the left frontal and temporal lobes, and diffuse cerebral volume loss. EEG showed slowing in the left cerebral hemisphere and no epileptiform activity.\nOn examination in the neurology clinic 4 days before admission, there was minimal spontaneous speech and interaction, impaired comprehension, generalized hypokinesis, a spastic gait with circumduction of the right leg and absence of normal right arm swing, mild pronator drift with the arms outstretched, and bilateral grasp reflexes. Lumbar puncture was repeated. The opening pressure was 23 cm of water and testing for infectious agents was negative; other results are shown in\nTable 1\n. On the day of admission, the patient fell at home and was unable to arise. Emergency medical services found him conscious; he was admitted to another hospital. Later that evening, he was found apneic and unarousable, without visible seizure activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun and the trachea was intubated; when electrocardiographic leads were placed, a QRS complex was found. He was transferred to this hospital. Medications on admission included oxcarbazepine and prednisone daily, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole every other day, and alendronate and interferon alfa weekly.\nOn examination, vital signs were normal, with ventilated respirations. The patient's eyes opened to sternal rub and tracked to the right and partially to the left, and the oculocephalic reflex was present. There was no spontaneous movement of the limbs. Myoclonus occurred after noxious stimuli to the legs; reflexes were brisk, and the plantar responses were flexor. MRI of the brain and cervical spine after the administration of gadolinium showed progression of previous signal abnormalities seen on T\n2\n-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, new areas of patchy enhancement in the left temporal lobe, and diffuse cord enhancement. Transthoracic echocardiography showed no valvular vegetations or intracardiac thrombus. CT of the chest revealed patchy consolidation of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe and consolidation of the right lower lobe. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents were administered. Therapy with interferon alfa was discontinued.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. David M. Greer:* May we see the imaging studies?*Dr. Javier Romero:* MRI of the brain at the time of the patient's first admission ([Figure 1A and 1B](#f01)) revealed increased signal intensity of the genu of the corpus callosum and left forceps minor on T2-weighted FLAIR images and minimal enhancement of the genu on T1-weighted images after the administration of gadolinium. Images obtained 4 months later revealed resolution of these findings; however, imaging studies from the second admission ([Figure 1C and 1D](#f01)) showed edema on FLAIR images of the left anterior and medial temporal lobe and extensive enhancement in the left frontal lobe on T1-weighted images after the administration of gadolinium.These imaging studies show a rapidly progressive process involving predominantly white matter (particularly in the right frontal lobe), basal ganglia, and the brain stem. The differential diagnosis includes a demyelinating disorder, a vasculitis (probably perivenular, in view of the preferential involvement of white matter), and an infiltrative tumor such as glioblastoma multiforme or lymphoma. The intermittent improvement tends to rule out a malignant tumor. A demyelinating process such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis may have a similar radiologic appearance but does not typically recur; the predominant involvement of basal ganglia does not rule out a demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis, but such a process would be unusual.[1](#core-r001) Thus, a vasculitis would best explain the findings.[2](#core-r002)*Dr. Greer:* This 30-year-old Korean\u2013American man, with a history of skin lesions, arthralgias, and oral and genital ulcers, had progressive disabling neurologic events. The neurologic examination disclosed left hemispheric dysfunction, followed by brain-stem dysfunction and autonomic instability. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed a neutrophilic pleocytosis, and neuroimaging showed changes consistent with inflammation and edema in the cortical and subcortical regions, including the brain stem. I cared for this patient and am aware of the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes infectious, demyelinating, and inflammatory disorders ([Table 2](#t02)).\n### Infectious Diseases\n\nHSV may cause recurrent oral (HSV-1) and genital (HSV-2) ulcers, and encephalitis may occur, particularly with primary infection with HSV-1. HSV encephalitis has a predilection for the temporal lobes and may be necrotizing and hemorrhagic.[3](#core-r003) HSV is unlikely in this case, however, since HSV encephalitis is monophasic (not waxing and waning), is more acute and rapidly progressive, and is not associated with arthritis or other skin manifestations, such as the erythema nodosum\u2013like lesions seen in this patient. Finally, PCR testing for HSV DNA was negative.Meningovascular syphilis may occur within the first 12 months after primary infection and is associated with headache and meningismus. It produces a basal meningitis, and cranial-nerve palsies (seventh, sixth, or second cranial nerve, in decreasing order of occurrence) are common.[4](#core-r004) Genital ulcers may occur, but they are typically not painful. Pachymeningitis affecting the brain and spinal cord may develop, typically 6 to 7 years after the primary infection, and may cause focal cerebral or spinal symptoms due to gumma formation or myelitis. Oral ulcers, arthritis, and skin lesions of erythema nodosum are rare in patients with syphilis. Testing for syphilis was negative in this case.Other less likely infectious possibilities include tuberculosis, varicella\u2013zoster virus infection, and Lyme disease. Tuberculosis typically causes basal meningitis with cranial-nerve palsies, hemiparesis, movement disorders, radiculomyelopathy, and transverse myelitis; parenchymal involvement may occur. The cerebrospinal fluid profile, the oral and genital lesions, the negative cerebrospinal fluid test, and the absence of granulomas on skin-biopsy specimens tend to rule out tuberculosis in this case. Varicella\u2013zoster virus may cause a granulomatous or necrotizing vasculitis with thrombosis and skin manifestations; disseminated varicella\u2013zoster virus infection occurs more often in immunocompromised patients.[5](#core-r005) Lyme disease occurs seasonally[6](#core-r006) and may produce a basal meningitis with headaches, cranial neuropathies, radiculopathy, and peripheral neuritis. The skin lesion of Lyme disease is commonly a migrating targetoid rash, unlike the lesions seen in this patient. Serologic testing for Lyme disease was negative.\n### Demyelinating Diseases\n\nThe symptoms of multiple sclerosis typically arise over a period of hours to days, and last for days to weeks. The symptoms can be relapsing and remitting, as they were initially in this case, or progressive. Lesions are primarily confined to the white matter, and higher cortical functions are typically spared early in the disease. The cerebrospinal fluid shows a modest pleocytosis, typically lymphocytic or monocytic. The IgG index is increased, and oligoclonal bands are almost always present when the disease is active. Brain-stem lesions are common, and autonomic dysfunction can occur. Focal symptoms and headaches can occur early, and seizures or paroxysmal events can occur later in the illness.[7](#core-r007) Ruling out multiple sclerosis in this case are the systemic symptoms, including arthritis, oral and genital ulcers, and skin manifestations, as well as the profound encephalitis with gray-matter involvement and the absence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n### Inflammatory Diseases\n\nA host of systemic, toxic, infectious, and primary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitides were considered in this case. I will briefly discuss the more likely ones.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly has systemic manifestations, including the skin, joints, and kidneys. Oral ulcers can occur; the skin rash is typically malar or discoid and can resemble erythema nodosum. Neurologic manifestations include psychiatric or behavioral changes, seizures, and peripheral neuropathy; ischemic strokes may be caused by hypercoagulability from antiphospholipid antibodies or by embolism from cardiac valves. True vasculitis affecting the CNS, however, is rare, if it occurs at all.[8](#core-r008) The negative antibody testing and the oral and genital ulcers in this case rule out a diagnosis of SLE.Sarcoidosis can affect the CNS, with basal meningitis and cranial neuropathies. Parenchymal lesions preferentially occur in the brain stem and hypothalamus.[9](#core-r009) Systemic involvement can include erythema nodosum. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis is unlikely in this case because of the oral and genital lesions, the normal cerebrospinal fluid and serum angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme levels, and the absence of pulmonary manifestations. Rheumatoid arthritis can involve the skin, eyes, joints, and CNS. It can cause basal meningitis, seizures, and encephalopathy, but extensive parenchymal involvement is uncommon. A compressive myelopathy can occur from atlantoaxial subluxation.[10](#core-r010) Reactive arthritis (formerly known as Reiter's syndrome) causes conjunctivitis, arthritis, sacroiliitis, and painless genital lesions,[11](#core-r011) but CNS involvement is rare.Basal meningitis can occur in Wegener's granulomatosis, causing cranial neuropathies, headaches, strokes, and seizures. The cerebrospinal fluid profile shows a mild-to-moderate lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased total protein and IgG index. Since testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in this case was negative,[12](#core-r012) and since there was no pulmonary, sinus, or renal involvement, a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis is unlikely. Polyarteritis nodosa and microscopic angiitis,[13](#core-r013) and the Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome may involve the CNS but typically have evidence of systemic vasculitis or, in the case of the Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome, asthma and eosinophilia. Anterior ischemic neuropathy can occur.[14](#core-r014) This patient did not have typical manifestations of these diseases.Giant-cell arteritis affects patients older than 50 years of age and primarily affects the extracranial aortic branches but rarely also the intracranial branches. Takayasu's arteritis affects the aorta and main proximal branches, and cranial-nerve palsies or an ischemic optic neuropathy can occur. Primary CNS angiitis may present with headaches, confusion, and focal or diffuse neurologic events, and the course is waxing and waning. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate may or may not be elevated. The characteristic angiographic appearance is of focal segmental narrowing of the more distal arterial branches but this appearance can seem falsely normal.[15](#core-r015) This disease, by definition, lacks systemic vasculitic manifestations, which were seen in this case.Vogt\u2013Koyanagi\u2013Harada syndrome is a uveo-meningitic syndrome, with vitiligo, alopecia, and poliosis. Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis may be dramatic, with a white-cell count up to 700 per cubic millimeter.[16](#core-r016) Patients with these syndromes do not, however, have oral or genital ulcers, and there is minimal parenchymal involvement of the brain.\n### Neuro-Beh\u00e7et's Disease\n\nBeh\u00e7et's disease, also known as Silk Route disease because of its occurrence in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, India, Pakistan, China, Korea, and Japan, along the ancient silk trading route, occurs more commonly in men than women, generally in those younger than 40 years of age.[17](#core-r017) Major criteria for the diagnosis include oral ulcers occurring at least three times per year; genital ulcers or scars; ocular involvement, specifically uveitis; skin lesions (erythema nodosum, folliculitis, or acne); and a positive skin-pathergy test.[18](#core-r018) Minor criteria include arthritis, deep venous thrombosis, superficial thrombophlebitis, epididymitis, a positive family history, and gastrointestinal, CNS, or vascular involvement. Ocular involvement with uveitis occurs in 70% of cases.[19](#core-r019) This patient's presentation at 26 years of age was consistent with Beh\u00e7et's disease, and he was treated for this with immunosuppressive agents, with a good response. Three years after the diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et's disease, neurologic symptoms developed.Neurologic involvement occurs in 5 to 10% of cases of Beh\u00e7et's disease.[20](#core-r020) Two patterns are recognized: vascular, either dural sinus thrombosis or arterial thrombosis, and parenchymal inflammation, which occurs in just over 50% of cases with neurologic involvement.[21,22](#core-r021) The brain stem and basal ganglia are commonly involved in advanced cases.[23](#core-r023) Cognitive deficits, attention deficit, and frontal-lobe dysfunction can be demonstrated on neuropsychiatric testing in a majority of patients,[21](#core-r021) and these deficits tend to be progressive, regardless of the pattern or frequency of acute neurologic attacks, a course of events that is reflected in our patient's history. The disease course can be relapsing\u2013remitting, chronic progressive, or secondary progressive.Laboratory testing may show an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white-cell count, and C-reactive protein level, as well as elevated levels of complement, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). The CSF profile is distinctive, in that there is a prominent neutrophilic pleocytosis, as seen in this patient.[24](#core-r024) The opening pressure is often elevated, as it was in this patient, and protein levels may be elevated and oligoclonal bands may be present. Neuroimaging may show enhancing lesions in the meninges and parenchyma, including the cortex, basal ganglia, and brain stem, as in this case.Our working diagnosis for this patient was neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease. However, we remained concerned about an infectious complication from his immunosuppressive therapy. For this reason, biopsy specimens of the brain and meninges were obtained.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Pavan K. Auluck:* Skin-biopsy specimens from the scalp and right buttock performed several years before admission revealed superficial and deep lymphocytic infiltrates with prominent perineural inflammation. A biopsy specimen of the scrotum ([Figure 2A](#f02)) revealed interface dermatitis with mixed acute and chronic inflammation and lymphocytic vasculitis, and lymphocytes were present within the walls of blood vessels. These features are consistent with cutaneous manifestations of Beh\u00e7et's disease.The brain biopsy consisted of samples of the leptomeninges and the left temporal tip. The leptomeninges were fibrotic, with increased collagen, proliferation of arachnoid cap cells, and diffuse inflammatory infiltration by lymphocytes and rare plasma cells. Lymphocytes and rare plasma cells were associated with a hyalinized and necrotic large-caliber leptomeningeal artery ([Figure 2B](#f02)). There was profound perivascular inflammation ([Figure 2C](#f02)) and a small focus of white-matter necrosis. The molecular layer of the cortex of the temporal tip was gliotic, and although neurons within layer II were identifiable, the other cortical layers (III\u2013VI) were vacuolated and gliotic ([Figure 2C](#f02), inset). Lymphocytes (predominantly CD3+ T cells but also a few CD20+ B cells) and CD68+ macrophages were found both within the brain parenchyma and around blood vessels ([Figure 2D](#f02)). Stains for fungi, bacteria, and mycobacteria and immunohistochemical stains for cytomegalovirus, varicella\u2013zoster virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2, polyomavirus, and toxoplasma were all negative.The process is a subacute and chronic meningoencephalitis that could not be attributed to a specific pathogen. This is consistent with parenchymal neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease.\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Robert P. Friday:* The management of mucocutaneous and articular manifestations of Beh\u00e7et's disease is aimed at controlling symptoms and preventing complications; therapy includes colchicine, oral corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and methotrexate, several of which this patient received before the recognition of his neurologic disease. Aside from azathioprine, which was associated with a reduced incidence of neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease in one study,[25](#core-r025) none of these have proved to be effective for treatment of neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease.[26](#core-r026) Cyclosporine, which this patient did not receive, has been reported to increase the risk of development of neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease when used for the treatment of uveitis.[27](#core-r027) Anti-TNF therapies (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept) have been reported to be effective in the treatment of both mucocutaneous and ocular Beh\u00e7et's disease.Parenchymal brain involvement, particularly both brain-stem and cortical involvement, as seen in this patient, has a far worse prognosis than does vascular neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease. Cognitive impairment, signs of brain-stem involvement on examination, involvement of both the cortex and brain stem on brain imaging, CSF pleocytosis with an elevated protein level, and more than two attacks with a secondary progressive course have all been associated with a poor prognosis in patients with neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease.[21](#core-r021) All these features are present in this case. Male sex is also a poor prognostic factor, particularly when associated with ocular or neurologic involvement, an observation first made by the Greek ophthalmologist Benediktos Adamantiades, who reported the first case of Silk Route disease in 1931, six years before Hulusi Beh\u00e7et's more widely known description of the disease.[28](#core-r028)Because of the rarity of neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease, prospective, placebo-controlled or comparative- treatment trials are lacking, and published material consists of case reports and case series. Management of parenchymal CNS disease has generally involved the adaptation of treatments for posterior uveitis associated with Beh\u00e7et's disease: typically, high-dose corticosteroids in combination with another agent such as cyclophosphamide or, less often, chlorambucil, azathioprine, or methotrexate.This patient received infliximab, in combination with methotrexate and corticosteroids, at the time of his initial presentation with symptoms of neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease, and his neurologic disease improved and stabilized briefly, then progressed. It is unclear whether infliximab is adequate first-line therapy for parenchymal neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease.[29\u201332](#core-r029) Although interferon alfa has been reported to be effective for the treatment of parenchymal neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease,[27](#core-r027) it did not prevent further neurologic decline or the progression of lesions on MRI in this patient.After the diagnosis was established by the brain biopsy and infections were ruled out, we recommended aggressive therapy with pulsed, high-dose, intravenous corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance immunosuppression with azathioprine if he had a favorable response. Unfortunately, relapse and refractory disease after therapy are likely because of the number of adverse prognostic factors.*Dr. Greer:* This patient was treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. His course was complicated by recurrent infections, aspiration pneumonias, autonomic dysfunction, pancreatitis, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. He ultimately required tracheotomy and placement of a gastrostomy tube. After 102 days, he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital. At that time, he was able to produce single words, to count, and to manipulate a ball with his right arm, but he did not have fine manual dexterity. Because of recurrent infections, cyclophosphamide was discontinued. Further neurologic decline and recurrent status epilepticus developed. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids and infliximab resulted in only transient improvement. He ultimately became nonverbal and unresponsive, with disconjugate gaze, nystagmus, and decorticate posturing. Three years after the onset of neurologic symptoms, after discussions with his family, comfort measures were instituted, and he died. An autopsy was performed.*Dr. Romero:* MRI performed 3 weeks before his death shows multiple infarcts in both cerebral hemispheres, with edema and extensive encephalomalacia, probably representing consecutive venous infarctions ([Figure 1E and 1F](#f01)).*Dr. Auluck:* The autopsy was limited to examination of the brain, which weighed 1095 g. The left cerebral hemisphere ([Figure 3A](#f03)) contained a large cavity involving the frontal operculum, the insula, and the left superior, middle, and anterior third of the inferior temporal gyri, with a dense, rubbery, yellow-brown lining; the overlying leptomeninges had yellow-brown discoloration, and the dura was fibrotic, with a yellow subdural membrane that was 0.6 cm thick. The white matter was dense, rubbery, and thin. The deep nuclei were indistinct, the hippocampi and amygdala were small and gliotic, and there was marked enlargement of the ventricles ([Figure 3B and 3C](#f03)). Brain-stem and cerebellar structures were small, yellow, and rubbery.Microscopical examination revealed widespread encephalomalacia throughout the cortex, deep nuclei, and cerebellum, characterized by small, scattered, gliotic foci that coalesced into large, irregular bands ([Figure 3D](#f03)). Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages were present within the leptomeninges, Virchow\u2013Robin spaces, and focally within brain parenchyma. In less affected regions, lymphocytes were present in a perivascular distribution. The pattern of injury appeared to follow the vasculature, but there was no fibrinoid necrosis or other evidence of active vasculitis.The findings in this case are those of a destructive subacute and chronic meningoencephalitis. Previous reports of neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease have described either meningitis with necrotizing foci[33](#core-r033) or disseminated encephalitis without overt gross abnormalities.[34](#core-r034) The pattern of injury suggests a process in which an initial lesion precipitates additional lesions nearby, which slowly coalesce into larger confluent areas of parenchymal destruction. Some authors have hypothesized that neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease is a \u201cperivasculitis,\u201d in which the tissue immediately surrounding the blood vessels is the immunologic target,[34](#core-r034) and that neurons die because of exposure to inflammatory cytokines.[35](#core-r035)\n",

      "question": "Dr. Jeffrey O. Greenberg\n(Medicine): A 31-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of facial swelling, fever, and hypotension.\nThe patient had relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis, associated with severe fatigue. Three weeks before admission, her neurologist prescribed modafinil to treat the fatigue. One week later, periorbital erythema, a clear conjunctival discharge, and a raised erythematous and pruritic rash developed on her face and scalp. She discontinued modafinil and used over-the-counter diphenhydramine, but the rash did not improve. Three days later, she went to the emergency room of a hospital near her home for evaluation. Cyproheptadine was prescribed, but the pharmacy dispensed perphenazine in error. Two days later, she was reevaluated at the same facility; the medication error was noted, and prednisone (60 mg) and cyproheptadine were begun. The facial rash improved transiently, but 5 days before admission, it recurred, and similar lesions developed on her back and chest.\nOn examination by a physician at this hospital the next day, there was swelling around the eyes, nose, and left ear, and an urticarial rash on the torso. Cyproheptadine was stopped, and diphenhydramine and ranitidine were added. During the next 2 days, painful swelling under the left mandible and pain in the hips developed, and facial swelling and erythema near the left eye increased. She returned to the hospital near her home and was given doxycycline for possible cellulitis of the face. The day before admission, increased facial swelling with discomfort in the left ear, blurred vision, pelvic pain, and dysuria had developed and she returned to the emergency department of that hospital.\nShe appeared anxious. The temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/74 mm Hg, the pulse 148 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. There was a maculopapular facial rash and swelling of the face, left parotid gland, and left external auditory canal, with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Levels of serum glucose and electrolytes and tests of liver and renal function were normal; results of other laboratory tests are shown in\nTable 1\n. Ninety minutes after arrival, meperidine and promethazine were administered, followed by diphenhydramine and famotidine. Shortly thereafter, she reported lightheadedness; the blood pressure was transiently 70/40 mm Hg, and the temperature 38.5\u00b0C. Electrocardiography showed borderline sinus tachycardia and mild right-axis deviation. Clindamycin, prednisone, and additional diphenhydramine were administered, followed by acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Approximately 18 hours after arrival, she was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for otolaryngologic evaluation of the facial and neck swelling.\nMultiple sclerosis had been diagnosed 4 years earlier during an episode of optic neuritis; a hyperintense lesion consistent with a plaque was seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Her symptoms included blurred vision, tingling and weakness in the left leg and arm, and extreme fatigue. Methylprednisolone infusions were given intermittently for exacerbations. Other medications in the past had included copaxone, amantadine, and daclizumab.\nShe had bipolar disorder, which was being treated with sertraline and oxcarbazepine. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) and echocardiograms were normal 2 years before admission. She was allergic to amoxicillin and doxycycline, which had caused gastrointestinal distress, blurred vision, and a rash. She lived with her husband and child, smoked 5 to 10 cigarettes daily, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. There was a family history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and bipolar disorder, and an aunt had systemic lupus erythematosus.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 118/70 mm Hg, the pulse 135 beats per minute, and the temperature 38.9\u00b0C; the respirations were 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 99% while she was breathing ambient air. She appeared ill. The physical examination was unchanged. Results of laboratory tests are shown in\nTable 1\n; specimens of blood were sent for culture. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the neck showed a mass, 2 cm in diameter in the inferior left masseter muscle near the angle of the jaw, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, and acute and chronic sinusitis. An ECG revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 120 beats per minute and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Radiographs of the pelvis and chest were normal. Vancomycin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, and stress-dose corticosteroids were administered.\nThe next morning, 21 hours after arrival in the emergency department, she reported chest tightness, worse with inspiration. An electrocardiogram (Figure 1 in the\nSupplementary Appendix\n, available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org) showed sinus tachycardia at 112 beats per minute and ST-segment elevation of 1 to 2 mm in leads I, aVL, V\n4\n, and V\n5\n. Results of laboratory tests are shown in\nTable 1\n. Heparin and metoprolol were administered intravenously. The blood pressure fell to 92/53 mm Hg and then to 71/30 mm Hg, and dopamine and saline were infused intravenously. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed mild left ventricular dysfunction with inferior and septal wall-motion abnormalities, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 43%, and a small pericardial effusion with partial right atrial inversion. She was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit 28 hours after arrival in the emergency department.\nOn arrival in the intensive care unit, the blood pressure was 149/119 mm Hg, with a pulsus paradoxus of 7 mm Hg, the pulse 135 beats per minute, and the temperature 38.5\u00b0C; the respirations were 20 breaths per minute, and the arterial oxygen saturation was 97% while the patient was breathing 6 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. Crackles were heard over both lung bases. The jugular venous pressure was 11 cm of water; there was no Kussmaul's sign, and no extra heart sounds were heard. The arms and legs were warm, with no edema. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 140 beats per minute and diffuse ST-segment elevation of 1 mm or more in leads I, aVL, V\n2\nthrough V\n6\n, and II.\nThe next morning, a chest radiograph showed perihilar pulmonary edema. The heart and mediastinum were normal. Repeated transthoracic echocardiography showed deterioration of left ventricular function, with an ejection fraction of 32%, increased thickness of the left ventricular wall, right ventricular dysfunction, a small circumferential pericardial effusion, right atrial and right ventricular inversions, and marked respiratory variations of the mitral and tricuspid inflow according to Doppler signals. The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, and a pulmonary arterial line was placed; mean right atrial, right ventricular end-diastolic, and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were 20 to 25 mm Hg. The cardiac output was 2.2 liters per minute. Pericardiocentesis was performed, revealing a mean pericardial pressure of 23 mm Hg. After 150 ml of pink, slightly turbid fluid was aspirated, the cardiac output rose to 3.3 liters per minute. Coronary angiography revealed no stenoses.\nThe aspirated fluid contained 1530 white cells per cubic millimeter, with 63% eosinophils; the protein level was 4.5 g per deciliter, the amylase level was 21 U per liter, and the lactic dehydrogenase level was 744 U per liter. A Gram's stain revealed no microorganisms. Solumedrol (1 g daily) was started intravenously.\nThe same day, pathological examination of a fine-needle aspiration of the mass in the left jaw revealed skeletal muscle with mixed inflammatory cells, including eosinophils; flow cytometry disclosed polyclonal CD19+ B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Serum protein electrophoresis and levels of immunoglobulins were normal, a test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:40 in a speckled pattern, and other autoantibody testing was negative. Other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nOn the fourth hospital day, a chest radiograph showed increased pulmonary edema. Another transthoracic echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion, but there was further decline of function of both ventricles, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 16%.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Marc S. Sabatine:* May we review the imaging studies?*Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard:* A CT scan of the facial bones and neck ([Figure 1A](#f01)), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed a rounded opacity with peripheral enhancement in the left masseter muscle, with central necrosis, which was suspicious for a small abscess, and left cervical lymphadenopathy. On the second hospital day, perihilar interstitial pulmonary edema was evident on chest radiographs ([Figure 1B](#f01)); the edema increased by day 4. The heart size remained normal, despite the presence of a small pericardial effusion.*Dr. Kian-Keong Poh:* The first transthoracic echocardiogram shows mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the inferior and septal walls and a small circumferential pericardial effusion resulting in right atrial inversion. The next day, there was increased left ventricular wall thickness and a further decrease in left ventricular systolic function, right ventricular systolic dysfunction with persistence of the pericardial effusion, and right atrial collapse ([Figure 2A](#f02), and [Video 1](#v01)). Pulsed-wave Doppler studies of the mitral inflow ([Figure 2B](#f02)) and tricuspid inflow and aortic outflow showed clinically significant respiratory variations, consistent with increased intrapericardial pressure.*Dr. Jessica L. Mega:* Cardiac catheterization showed an elevated right atrial pressure of 22 mm Hg, a right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 22 mm Hg, and a mean pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure of 25 mm Hg (Fig. 2 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)). The pericardial pressure was elevated, at 23 mm Hg, equal to the mean right atrial pressure (Fig. 3A in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)). In addition, there was marked variation in the aortic pressure tracing with respirations (Fig. 3B in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)). After fluid was aspirated from the pericardial space, the pericardial pressure was 10 mm Hg and the aortic pressure tracing normalized (Fig. 3C and 3D in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)). Before the procedure, the cardiac index was 1.3 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area, with a stroke volume index of 9 ml per square meter. After the procedure, the cardiac index improved to 1.9 liters per minute per square meter, with a stroke volume index of 16 ml per square meter.*Dr. Poh:* Echocardiography performed 1 day after the pericardial drainage revealed no pericardial effusion. However, the left and right ventricular functions had deteriorated further; in particular, the left ventricle showed diffuse and severe involvement, with hypokinesia in all walls. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 16%, contributed mainly by its base ([Video 2](#v01)). There was echocardiographic documentation of a rapidly progressive process over a few days, resulting in biventricular failure.*Dr. Sabatine:* I participated in this patient's care and am aware of the diagnosis. Three weeks before this 31-year-old woman presented to this hospital, periorbital erythema, a conjunctival discharge, and a pruritic facial rash developed after she had started taking modafinil. Despite treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids, her symptoms persisted. At another hospital, a low-grade fever, left facial swelling, and transient hypotension were noted. She was transferred here for evaluation of a possible facial abscess. However, her course took an unexpected turn when chest pain developed, and she was found to have ST-segment elevation and elevated cardiac biomarkers of necrosis. Although initially there was concern about an acute coronary syndrome, the patient's sex and age, the diffuse nature of the ST-segment elevation, the relatively minor degree of elevation of biomarkers, and the mild diffuse left ventricular dysfunction that did not match the ECG changes all pointed to myopericarditis.There were several early clues to the severity of this patient's hemodynamic compromise. Hypotension that developed in response to treatment with a beta-blocker showed that she was dependent on sympathetically mediated increases in heart rate and contractility to maintain blood pressure. This finding suggests a greatly reduced stroke volume, most commonly seen in cases of hypovolemic shock. Yet after aggressive fluid resuscitation, although her blood pressure returned to normal, she had a narrow pulse pressure, consistent with a low stroke volume. This observation, coupled with elevated jugular venous pulsations and crackles over the lung fields, suggested profound myocardial dysfunction caused by impaired contractility, pericardial tamponade, or, as it turns out in this case, both.Although the list of cardiomyopathies is extensive, the rapid deterioration of systolic function in this patient suggests an acute myocarditis. Another possibility that was briefly considered was cardiac involvement by a sarcoma or a lymphoma because of her fever, soft-tissue mass, and cervical lymphadenopathy. However, myocardial involvement by tumor typically presents with restrictive physiology and arrhythmias, rather than with rapidly progressive systolic dysfunction, and neither fine-needle aspiration of the mass nor cytologic examination of the pericardial fluid revealed malignant tumor.\n### Infectious Myocarditis\n\nSeveral forms of myocarditis merit consideration in this case.[1](#core-r001) Viral myocarditis is often preceded by a viral prodrome, although this finding is neither sensitive nor specific. Presentations range from slow development of heart failure to rapid development of cardiogenic shock. The ECG often shows nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities; echocardiographic findings range from a nondilated left ventricle seen in the acute phase to a spherical, dilated left ventricle in the chronic phase. This patient's presentation is best described as fulminant myocarditis, which has a distinct onset, a nondilated and thickened left ventricle, and severe systolic dysfunction leading to cardiogenic shock.[2](#core-r002) Patients either recover spontaneously or die.[3](#core-r003) Bacterial myocarditis was a possibility in this patient because of her possible abscess. However, one would have expected a purulent pericardial fluid and distributive shock requiring vasopressors. Lyme disease can manifest with rash and myocarditis, but the latter is usually mild. Rickettsial disease presents with rash, fever, hypotension, and only a mild myocarditis.\n### Autoimmune Myocarditis\n\nAutoimmune myocarditides should be considered in this young woman with an autoimmune disorder (multiple sclerosis), a rash, and a family history of systemic lupus erythematosus. Both systemic lupus erythematosus and polymyositis can be associated with pericarditis and myocarditis, but the myocarditis tends to be mild. This patient did not have rheumatologic, dermatologic, or serologic manifestations of those disorders.\n### Idiopathic Isolated Giant-Cell Myocarditis\n\nIdiopathic giant-cell myocarditis is a fulminant disease that typically affects persons in their fourth and fifth decades.[4](#core-r004) Approximately 20% of patients have an autoimmune disorder, although giant-cell myocarditis has not been described in association with multiple sclerosis. Patients often report antecedent symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, and chest pain is uncommon. Symptoms of heart failure develop over a period of weeks to months, with a rapid deterioration of cardiac function during the final stages of the disease. Conduction-system disease and ventricular tachycardia may occur because of infiltration of the fascicles and myocardium, but ST-segment elevation is extremely rare. On echocardiography, left ventricular dilatation without hypertrophy is seen, with segmental or diffuse areas of hypokinesis. The pericardial effusion with eosinophils, the chest pain, and the ST-segment elevation seen in this patient are not typical features of idiopathic giant-cell myocarditis.\n### Eosinophilic Cardiomyopathies\n\nEosinophilic cardiomyopathies include a range of clinical presentations and pathological findings ([Table 2](#t02)). L\u00f6ffler's endocarditis[5](#core-r005) is a restrictive cardiomyopathy due to endomyocardial disease with mural thrombi (so-called thrombotic endocarditis) and is secondary to eosinophilia from many causes. Endomyocardial fibrosis[6](#core-r006) is a restrictive cardiomyopathy affecting persons in tropical climates in whom peripheral eosinophilia is inconsistent. In both these disorders, which probably represent a continuum,[7](#core-r007) the disease typically develops gradually over a period of months to years. In contrast, this patient had a rapid decline in left ventricular function.\n### Acute Eosinophilic Myocarditis\n\nAcute eosinophilic myocarditis (also known as hypersensitivity myocarditis) is caused by a drug hypersensitivity reaction[8](#core-r008) and is characterized by fever, rash, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated biomarkers of necrosis.[9](#core-r009) ECG occasionally shows ST-segment elevation. Echocardiography reveals mild systolic dysfunction, increased wall thickness due to edema, and occasionally a pericardial effusion. Heart failure is typically mild, and patients die of arrhythmias, rather than pump dysfunction.[10](#core-r010) Many drugs have been implicated in acute eosinophilic myocarditis ([Table 3](#t03)),[9,10](#core-r009) including tetracyclines,[10](#core-r010) carbamazepine,[11](#core-r011) and perphenazine.[12](#core-r012) When I saw this patient, I found no reports that associated modafinil with acute eosinophilic myocarditis. The time of onset after starting a drug varies from days to months. The incidence of acute eosinophilic myocarditis ranges from more than 40% of patients recently taking sulfonamides[8](#core-r008) to less than 1% of patients taking clozapine.[13](#core-r013)\n### Acute Necrotizing Eosinophilic Myocarditis\n\nA fulminant form of hypersensitivity myocarditis, called acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis, presents with severe heart failure that develops within days to a week.[14\u201319](#core-r014) Although initiation of a new medication is often the precipitant (especially in patients with a history of an allergic diathesis), cases occur in the setting of viral or parasitic infection, the Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome, or the hypereosinophilic syndrome. Fever and rash are common. The presentation often mimics that of acute myocardial infarction, with chest pain, ST-segment elevation, and elevated biomarkers of necrosis.[20](#core-r020) Blood eosinophilia is present in most cases but can be mild. Echocardiography typically reveals normal chamber size (reflecting the sudden onset of the process and lack of time for dilatation), increased wall thickness (probably reflecting edema), and severe, biventricular diffuse systolic dysfunction. A pericardial effusion is seen in 75% of cases, occasionally causing tamponade.[21](#core-r021) The mortality exceeds 50%, and the median survival is only a few days. Treatment consists of high-dose corticosteroids,[9,19,22](#core-r009) pharmacologic or mechanical ventricular support, or both.[23](#core-r023)\n### Summary\n\nIn view of the tempo and severity of this patient's disease, I thought that the most likely diagnoses were fulminant viral myocarditis, idiopathic giant-cell myocarditis, and acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis. The chest pain, ST-segment elevation, lack of conduction block, and presence of a pericardial effusion make idiopathic giant-cell myocarditis unlikely. The exposure to drugs associated with hypersensitivity myocarditis, the rash and fever, and the eosinophil-rich pericardial effusion favor acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis over fulminant viral myocarditis. Since the treatment of these three diseases differs, a specific diagnosis is important. Histologic examination would most clearly differentiate these entities, and thus the diagnostic procedure was an endomyocardial biopsy.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. James R. Stone:* Examination of the specimen from the endomyocardial biopsy revealed an extensive inflammatory infiltrate composed mostly of eosinophils and macrophages and associated with myocyte necrosis ([Figure 3A](#f03)). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the lymphocytes were almost entirely CD3+ T cells, with a predominance of CD4+ over CD8+ cells (Fig. 4 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)). There was no endocardial thickening or necrotizing vasculitis, nor were there any giant cells. Focally, the inflammatory infiltrate was associated with small interstitial vessels, a feature that has been referred to as non-necrotizing vasculitis. There was no viral cytopathic effect or intracellular parasites, and special stains for organisms were negative.In the absence of evidence of infection, the histologic findings on the endomyocardial biopsy are that of an acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis.[16,18,19,24,25](#core-r016) In this patient, they are most likely a manifestation of a severe form of drug-induced hypersensitivity myocarditis.*Dr. Mega:* At the time of the ventricular biopsy, an intraaortic balloon pump was placed because of deteriorating left ventricular function. The patient then returned to the cardiac care unit, and methylprednisolone (1 mg per day) was continued. Initially, her clinical status improved, and the dopamine dose was reduced. However, on the evening of the fourth hospital day, a refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmia developed, and she died. An autopsy was performed.*Dr. Stone:* The heart was enlarged (468 g), with mild biventricular dilatation and a mottled appearance of the ventricular myocardium ([Figure 3B](#f03), and Fig. 5 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)), reflecting necrosis involving about 80% of the myocardium ([Figure 3C](#f03)). Around the outer portions of the zones of necrosis, there was an intense inflammatory infiltrate ([Figure 3C](#f03), inset, top) consisting predominantly of eosinophils and macrophages, as observed in the endomyocardial biopsy. In the central portions of the necrotic zones, macrophage giant cells were present and were engulfing necrotic myocytes ([Figure 3C](#f03), inset, bottom). As in the biopsy specimen, the T cells were predominantly CD4+ (Fig. 6 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)). The wall of the coronary sinus, containing cardiac myocytes, also showed inflammatory infiltration and necrosis (Fig. 7 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)). The inflammation in the heart extended into the epicardium, and there was focal eosinophilic vasculitis of the epicardial veins (Fig. 8 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)). Stains of the myocardium for microorganisms were negative.Skeletal muscle from the deltoid, diaphragm, and extraocular muscles showed similar changes (Fig. 8 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)). Retrospective analysis of the fine-needle aspirate from the left masseter muscle revealed eosinophils, macrophages, and fragments of necrotic skeletal muscle and macrophage giant cells (Figure 9 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)). In the liver, small zones of necrosis in a random distribution were seen to contain inflammatory cells, predominantly macrophages with lesser numbers of T cells and rare eosinophils (Fig. 10 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)). There was no viral cytopathic effect, and in situ hybridization for Epstein\u2013Barr virus RNA was negative.These findings indicate the presence of a severe systemic necrotizing inflammatory reaction, associated with eosinophils and giant cells. Several systemic processes can result in giant cells in the heart, including sarcoidosis, acute rheumatic fever, rheumatoid disease, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody\u2013associated vasculitides, and amyloidosis, as well as mycobacterial, parasitic, and fungal infections, none of which are present in this case. Both giant cells and eosinophils may be present in giant-cell myocarditis, hypersensitivity myocarditis, and acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis.Giant-cell myocarditis occurs in two distinct forms: idiopathic isolated giant-cell myocarditis and thymoma-associated giant-cell polymyositis. Idiopathic isolated giant-cell myocarditis is limited to the heart,[4,26](#core-r004) with infiltration of myocardium by lymphocytes, macrophages, giant cells, and eosinophils and marked necrosis, whereas in thymoma-associated giant-cell polymyositis, a similar inflammatory infiltrate involves both cardiac and skeletal muscles.[27,28](#core-r027) In giant-cell myocarditis, the T lymphocytes show a predominance of CD8+ over CD4+ staining,[29](#core-r029) and the giant cells are typically proximate to both viable and dead myocytes, suggesting that they have an active role in the killing of myocytes.Hypersensitivity myocarditis is often defined as a histologic pattern in which there is infiltration of the myocardium by eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes with minimal to no necrosis of myocytes.[8\u201310](#core-r008) When necrotizing drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions are found, names such as drug-induced acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis[16,18,19,24,25](#core-r016) or drug-induced giant-cell myocarditis have been used[30\u201332](#core-r030); however, these are probably the extreme end of the spectrum of hypersensitivity myocarditis. In cases of acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis, as opposed to cases of giant-cell myocarditis, giant cells may be seen only in areas of necrotic myocytes, where they are engaged in the removal of opsonin-coated myocyte debris, and the T cells are predominantly CD4+.[33](#core-r033) Thus, this case has both morphologic and immunophenotypic features of acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis. At autopsy, both necrotizing and non-necrotizing cases of drug-induced eosinophilic myocarditis may have extracardiac involvement, as was seen in this case; most commonly, the liver is involved, and on rare occasions other organs are involved, including the lung, the kidney, and skeletal muscle.[8\u201310,30\u201332](#core-r008)This patient died in 2006. Since then, the package insert for modafinil has been modified to include a warning relating to multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions.*Dr. Matthew P. Frosch:* The brain and spinal cord were also examined. The plaques of multiple sclerosis that had been identified by imaging studies were confirmed by gross and microscopical examination of the brain, showing loss of myelin ([Figure 3D](#f03)) with relative axonal preservation. Although the plaques were chronic, there was moderate perivascular inflammation ([Figure 3D](#f03), inset) consisting of T cells with a predominance of CD4+ cells (Fig. 11 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)).Inflammation was also present in the spinal cord, most prominently in the dorsal horn ([Figure 3E](#f03)), associated with gliosis but not demyelination. There was also inflammation in the leptomeninges and in the proximate portion of the peripheral nerve (Figure 12 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP357212167DC1)). Even though none of these lesions contained eosinophils, the distribution of the inflammatory process (both central and peripheral nervous systems) and the absence of associated active demyelination suggests that these represent involvement by the systemic necrotizing hypersensitivity reaction rather than a manifestation of multiple sclerosis.*Dr. Aaron Baggish* (Cardiology Division): The cause of death in this patient was a malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the context of clinically improving heart failure. Do you think there is a role for treating such patients with prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy?*Dr. Sabatine:* Extrapolating from the literature on myocardial infarction, pharmacologic arrhythmia prophylaxis does not appear to be beneficial; rather, patients should be monitored closely and arrhythmias treated immediately.\n",

      "question": "A sixty-four-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of unresponsiveness.\nSeven months previously she had fallen and sustained a bimalleolar fracture of the left ankle, which was placed in a cast for thirteen weeks. She entered a nursing home at that time and had not walked since then because of the fear of falling. She came periodically to the Fracture Clinic, where it was observed that her weight diminished by 5 pounds at each visit. During a brief stay at home one month before admission she was incontinent of stool, anorectic and depressed. Two days before entry her relatives reported that she stared at them but did not speak.\nThere was a past history of a hiatus hernia and of cholelithiasis. She had smoked regularly for many years and had taken digitalis for an unknown period.\nPhysical examination revealed an unresponsive, dehydrated, chronically ill woman with numerous decubitus ulcers. The neck was supple and firm; shotty lymph nodes were palpable in the anterior cervical region bilaterally. The lungs and heart were normal. The abdomen was normal except for a prominent aortic pulsation. Examination of the extremities showed diminished pedal pulses, thrombosed varicose veins and + edema of the left leg. Neurologic examination disclosed slight narrowing of the left palpebral fissure, flaccidity of all the extremities, a Babinski sign on the left side and a questionable plantar response on the right.\nThe temperature was 102\u00b0F. per rectum, the pulse 120, and the respirations 26. The blood pressure was 120 systolic, 70 diastolic.\nThe urine gave a + test for protein and a + + + + test for glucose; the sediment contained an occasional white cell and a rare hyaline cast per high-power field. The hematocrit was 32 per cent; the white-cell count was 18,800, with 89 per cent neutrophils, 2 per cent band forms, 6 per cent lymphocytes, 2 per cent monocytes and 1 per cent eosinophils. The glucose was 290 mg., the urea nitrogen 58 mg., and the calcium 8.4 mg. per 100 ml. The sodium was 130 milliequiv., the potassium 4.1 milliequiv., and the chloride 77 milliequiv. per liter. The glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) was 30 units. The prothrombin content was 70 per cent. A culture of the throat yielded an abundant growth of betahemolytic streptococci and\nStaphylococcus aureus\n. A blood culture yielded no bacterial growth. A culture of the urine gave an abundant growth of\nProteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli\n. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110; the T waves were inverted, and the ST segments slightly depressed in Leads 1, 2, 3, aVL, aVF and V\n4\nthrough V\n6\n; the T waves were low upright or diphasic, and the ST segments were depressed in Leads V\n1\nthrough V\n3\n. X-ray films of the chest showed a bandlike density in the left upper lobe, probably in the anterior segment; the lungs were otherwise clear, and the heart appeared normal. A limited examination of the skull revealed that the pineal gland was in the midline; calcification was seen within the carotid siphon. The right carotid artery was calcified. Severe degenerative changes were evident in the cervical and thoracic spine and in the right scapula; there was maldevelopment of the right humerus.\nFluids were given intravenously, and the daily digitalis therapy was continued; an indwelling catheter was inserted into the bladder. The temperature fell promptly to 99.6\u00b0F. With hydration the patient became more alert during the next four days, moved the fingers and toes bilaterally and suggested that her illness was due to \"nervousness and loneliness.\" There was no gross movement of the arms or legs, and the bilateral Babinski sign persisted. On the fifth hospital day the temperature rose to 101.8\u00b0F., and inspiratory rales were heard at the base of the left lung. Urinalysis revealed 10 to 15 white cells per high-power field. Methenamine mandelate and penicillin, 1,000,000 units every four hours, were begun. The temperature fell to normal within three days, and the urea nitrogen decreased to 15 mg. per 100 ml. On the tenth hospital day an electrocardiogram (\nFig. 1\n) showed a sinus tachycardia at a rate of 115; there was a tendency to low voltage in all leads; the T waves were low upright in Leads 1, aVL and V\n1\nthrough V\n3\nand diphasic in Leads 2, aVF and V\n4\nthrough V\n6\n, with slight depression of the ST segments in Leads 2, 3, aVR and V\n1\nthrough V\n6\n; the P waves were prominent in Leads 2, 3 and aVF. An x-ray film of the chest (\nFig. 2\n) disclosed a slight increase in the left-upper-lobe density and a hazy density at the right costophrenic angle. On the following day the temperature rose to 101\u00b0F. The hematocrit was 24 per cent, and the white-cell count 19,200, with 87 per cent neutrophils. Chloramphenicol, 500 mg. every six hours, was begun.\nOn the twelfth hospital day an attempted biopsy of the cervical lymph nodes disclosed a large calcific plaque at the bifurcation of the left common carotid artery; no abnormal lymph nodes were found. A large decubitus ulcer over the left buttock was debrided; culture of the ulcer yielded an abundant growth of\nP. mirabilis\nand a few colonies of\nEsch. coli\nand\nStaph. aureus\n. An x-ray film of the chest (\nFig. 3\n) showed no change in the density in the left upper lobe; there was a density with central rarefaction at the left-lung base medially, and the hazy density at the right costophrenic angle was increased. The temperature on the following day was 100.2\u00b0F. and remained between 99 and 100.6\u00b0F. thereafter. On the evening of the seventeenth hospital day the patient died suddenly.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Kenneth T. Bird\\*: For at least nineteen days before the terminal event this patient was apparently bedridden and totally immobilized. All the extremities were flaccid, and during the hospital course there was no gross movement of the arms and legs. This is nearly the optimal state for the production of venous stasis in the legs. In turn, the likelihood of phlebothrombosis is considerable, as is the possibility of pulmonary embolism under such circumstances. Furthermore, there was edema of the left leg.May we review the electrocardiograms?Dr. William F. McNeely: The first electrocardiogram shows fairly widespread ST-segment depression in the precordial leads, with inverted or diphasic T waves in most of the leads. The second tracing ([Fig. 1](#f001)), taken on the tenth hospital day, reveals only minor changes. We find a decrease in the voltage in comparison with the earlier tracing. The ST-segment and T-wave changes persist but are less noticeable than on the previous electrocardiogram, and I would call them nonspecific. If asked whether this pattern is compatible with cor pulmonale I would have to answer, \"Yes.\"Dr. Bird: Should we consider a posterior myocardial infarction on the basis of these tracings?Dr. McNeely: Not very strongly.Dr. Bird: May we see the x-ray films of the chest?Dr. Melvin E. Clou se: The films of the chest taken on admission reveal an elongated density in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe. The bases of the lungs are clear. I cannot outline the pulmonary arteries. Enlarged lymph nodes are not visible in the paratracheal region. The film of the chest taken on the tenth hospital day ([Fig. 2](#f002)) reveals a slight increase in the size of the left-upper-lobe density. There is haziness at the right costophrenic angle, and the film taken two days later ([Fig. 3](#f003)) reveals an increase in the density in this area. In addition, a cavity at the base of the left lung has appeared in the two-day interval.Dr. Bird: Are the changes at the base of the right lung consistent with pulmonary embolism with infarction?Dr. Clouse: Yes, they are.Dr. Bird: Does the appearance of the lesion at the left-lung base suggest cavitation in an infarct?Dr. Clouse: It would be extremely unusual for a bland infarct to cavitate in two days. This course of events is more compatible with a septic embolus.Dr. Bird: Is the infiltration in the left-upper-lung field diagnostic of any specific process?Dr. Clouse: No, it is not. I think that the density in the left upper lobe and those elsewhere are separate and unrelated.Dr. Bird: This patient apparently had 2 and possibly 3 pulmonary parenchymal diseases. The films demonstrate changes that I interpret as pulmonary infarction at the right-lung base and a cavitary process at the left-lung base. The presence of cavitation in a bland, nonseptic pulmonary infarct is unusual, but a suppurative bronchopneumonia may undergo cavitation rapidly. Therefore, I believe that the cavitary process at the base of the left lung was due to localized suppurative disease, probably secondary to aspiration and possibly related to the presence of a nasogastric tube. Incidentally, the knowledge that a tube was employed is helpful because it permits me to postulate interference with the normal pharyngeal and epiglottic protective reflexes. The infiltrate in the left upper lobe was situated in the anterolateral segment, and there is no evidence of cavitation within it. Granulomatous disease may be localized in this area, but it is distinctly uncommon. In this category I include tuberculosis and the various mycoses. Even though there is nothing characteristic about the left-upper-lobe infiltration, I shall suggest that it was a bronchogenic carcinoma.It is obvious that repeated neurologic examinations were performed, and presumably no sensory defects were found. I am compelled to comment on the failure to mention the findings on lumbar puncture, which must have been done. It certainly would be interesting to know whether the cerebrospinal fluid disclosed evidence of meningovascular syphilis or carcinomatosis of the meninges. The major clinical neurologic finding in this case was the flaccidity of the extremities, with no gross movement of the arms and legs, although the patient was able to move the fingers and toes at one time during the hospital course. Cerebral hematogenous metastases, which are usually multiple, occur in about a third of the patients with bronchogenic carcinoma by the time of death. Metastatic cerebral disease, then, might account in,part for this woman's neurologic state. An electroencephalographic study or even a brain scan might have been helpful in this regard. However, bronchogenic carcinoma may be responsible for a variety of remote symptoms and signs in the absence of metastases. The extrapulmonary nonmetastatic manifestations of bronchogenic carcinoma include metabolic, hematologic, vascular, connective-tissue, osseous and, finally, neurologic abnormalities.[1](#core-r001) This patient did have hyponatremia on admission, making me at least think of the possibility of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. She was anemic, and although nutritional factors were probably involved, the possibility that the anemia was a hematologic manifestation of bronchogenic carcinoma must be mentioned.Lord Brain[2](#core-r002) has devised a classification of the neurologic complications of neoplasms, with particular reference to bronchogenic carcinoma. He believes that the incidence of significant nonmetastatic neurologic disease in association with bronchogenic carcinoma is between 1 and 2 per cent. The categorization that he has prepared is thoughtful but tongue twisting: carcinomatous encephalomyeloneuropathy; the myopathic-myasthenic syndrome; and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. In the first group, carcinomatous encephalomyeloneuropathy, there are degenerative changes in the ganglion cells in the nervous system resulting in paralyses, in the dorsal-root ganglions resulting in sensory abnormalities or in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum resulting in cerebellar symptoms. Other clinical features include ptosis, ophthalmoplegia and bulbar palsy. There may be a sensory neuropathy, a motor neuropathy, which mimics and sometimes is described as chronic poliomyelitis, or a mixed sensory and motor neuropathy. Finally, there are psychological disorders, sometimes characterized by progressive dementia, mood disturbance and even depression. In the second group, the myopathic-myasthenic syndrome, the disease is characterized by atrophy of muscle fibers, most apparent in the proximal portions of the limbs. The patient is unable to arise from a sitting position or abduct the arms against even slight pressure because of the atrophy of the proximal musculature of the limbs. No fasciculations are observed in association with the myopathicmyasthenic syndrome. It has been said that the muscle is the least susceptible to neoplastic metastasis but most often shows the remote effects of carcinoma, especially in the absence of cachexia. The disorders in the third group, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, result from an unusual demyelinating lesion of the cerebral hemispheres, with relative or complete sparing of the spinal cord. In 1961 Richardson[3](#core-r003) drew attention to this exotic syndrome and indicated that although the average course has a duration of three to four months the disease may progress rapidly and terminate within a month. The symptoms usually include dementia, hemiparesis, speech abnormalities and aphasia. Impairment of vision was observed and thought to be due to interruption of the visual pathways in the occipital lobes.I shall suggest that this patient had multifocal leukoencephalopathy secondary to a bronchogenic carcinoma in addition to pulmonary emboli with infarction and necrotizing bronchopneumonia. I would be interested in knowing whether a complete neurologic examination was done and what was found on lumbar puncture.Dr. W. Jost Michelsen: A lumbar puncture was not done. Our formulation of this problem was almost identical to yours when the patient was first transferred to the Neurologic Service. However, when we learned that for several days she had been unresponsive in a nursing home without taking adequate nourishment and was dehydrated, an intravenous drip of dextrose and water was started, and shortly thereafter this woman, who had had a flaccid quadriplegia and had apparently been in coma, was able to talk and move all the distal portions of the extremities. On reviewing the x-ray films we believed that this was a case of bronchogenic carcinoma with cerebral metastases. She was febrile, with a urinary-tract infection and a septic decubitus ulcer. Shortly before her death there was an abortive attempt to biopsy what we thought were involved lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular area to establish the etiology of the lesion in the left upper lobe, and the next morning she was scheduled to undergo bronchoscopic study, which did not take place. The sensory examination was indeed negative, and we ascribed the bilateral extensor plantar response to cervical myelopathy.Dr. M. Henry Clifford: I'd like to comment on two points. I assume, Dr. Bird, that you jumped at the diagnosis of cancer of the lung partly because the lesion was in the anterior portion of the lung, as there is no other evidence directly pointing to that diagnosis. Secondly, if the patient had neuropathy secondary to a cancer of the lung with metastases, would a lumbar puncture necessarily have been helpful? I recently saw a patient with bronchogenic cancer whose initial clue to cerebellar involvement was that of falling backward when his lungs were examined. We were convinced that he had the neuropathy of a cancer of the lung rather than a cerebellar metastasis. The lumbar puncture was entirely normal, including a normal protein value and cell count, thereby heightening our assurance of this diagnosis. However, the post-mortem examination done only a few days later revealed cerebellar metastases from the lung.Dr. Bird: Many entities can simulate bronchogenic carcinoma clinically and radiologically. A workup of this patient, had she been in better condition, might have included a bronchoscopic study, not with the idea of seeing the actual lesion, which apparently was in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe and well beyond the view of the bronchoscope, but to obtain direct bronchial smears or bronchial washings or even a biopsy of the spur to the left upper lobe, since there may have been submucosal extension of the tumor. Bronchial washings would have been helpful since she apparently was unable to cough and expectorate. As far as a lumbar puncture is concerned, normal cerebrospinal-fluid findings would have helped me a little bit in the diagnosis of this strange nonmetastatic neurologic complication of bronchogenic carcinoma because in general cerebral metastases are associated with an elevated protein level and increased pressure in the fluid. There are exceptions, of course, as Dr. Clifford has suggested.Dr. Arnold N. Weinberg: Dr. Bird, I wondered why you didn't make more of the history of fairly profound weight loss, mental torpor, anorexia and depression, all of which could have been due to just the fracture and being in bed, of course, as well as the finding of diabetes and then lung lesions and the downhill course. Carcinoma of the pancreas is perhaps one other important consideration in this case.Dr. Bird: On the basis of one blood sugar determination, with no follow-up studies and nothing to suggest persistent glycosuria or the administration of antidiabetic agents, I couldn't consider diabetes seriously.Dr. Hibbard E. Williams: In the article to which you referred Lord Brain commented that a smooth, beefy-red tongue is characteristic of carcinomatous myopathy. It would be interesting to know the appearance of this patient's tongue.Dr. Michelsen: I don't recollect it except that it was very dry.Dr. Williams: In the series of cases of leukoencephalopathy reported by Richardson, didn't most of the patients have lymphomatous disease rather than carcinoma?Dr. Bird: Of the 22 patients in that series, 6 had Hodgkin's disease, 4 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 3 had lymphosarcoma, 2 had chronic myelogenous leukemia, 2 had sarcoidosis, 2 had carcinomatosis, 1 had miliary tuberculosis, 1 had Coronary Artery disease, and 1 was classified as unknown (old age). You are correct.Dr. Oscar E. Starobin: Would you consider the possibility of right-sided endocarditis in this case to account for the fever, the multiple pulmonary densities and particularly the cavitation? As another alternative, one might raise the question of a patent foramen ovale, with systemic and pulmonary embolization. You did mention that the swollen legs and edema provided a likely source of emboli to the pulmonary circulation.Dr. Bird: Because of the negative blood cultures I decided against a diagnosis of endocarditis.Dr. Starobin: In cases of right-sided endocarditis, of course, the cultures are not necessarily positive.Dr. Bird: Because there was no evidence of bacterial bloodstream invasion and because cavitation of a bland infarct is relatively unusual, I postulated another mechanism.Dr. Edgar B. Taft: The importance and convenience of cytologic examination of the sputum to establish a diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma is not fully appreciated. I realize that in this case it probably was not possible because the patient evidently wasn't coughing, but in general this simple procedure is too often bypassed, and bronchial washings and more elaborate procedures are employed. It is quite possible, for instance, to stimulate sputum production by inhalation of appropriate aerosols.Dr. Bird: That in turn reminds me of the fact that we are using transcricoidal puncture for the collection of secretions in patients who have no sputum or are unable to cough because of systemic disease. Lidocaine is injected just above the cricoid cartilage and below the wings of the thyroid cartilage, allowing the introduction of either a small plastic catheter or a moderately large needle through which saline can be instilled rapidly. An explosive cough invariably occurs. This maneuver will frequently yield sputum for cytologic and bacteriologie examination.Dr. Benjamin Castleman: What was the diagnosis of the student discusser?Mr. George F. Donahower: My primary diagnosis was likewise bronchogenic carcinoma. However, I did not believe that the patient had a specific neuropathy.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Castleman: Dr. Bird was correct that the immediate cause of death was a pulmonary embolus. We found a very large, nonadherent embolus in the right main pulmonary artery, which undoubtedly was a very recent occurrence, although the microscopical examination revealed beginning organization of the intima in a few spots. There were two infarcts in the right lung; one was in the lower lobe at the anterior costophrenic angle and probably was responsible for the shadow in that location that was seen on the x-ray films, and the other was in the middle lobe ([Fig. 4](#f004)). Microscopically, early organization and slight encapsulation were evident. The shape of each of these infarcts created a convexity pointing toward the heart, which was described by Hampton many years ago and is known in this part of the world as \"Hampton's hump.\"[4](#core-r004) This sign, which is an extremely valuable diagnostic clue, is demonstrated beautifully on the x-ray films in this case. The source of the emboli was the left femoral vein, the site of the old injury, where there was an adherent thrombus.We found two lesions in the left lung ( [Fig. 5](#f005) ). The lesion in the lower lobe measured 3 by 4 cm. and was nodular but when sectioned proved to be a chronic abscess with a cavity full of a purulent exudate, from which *Staph. aureus* was grown on culture. The upper-lobe lesion was more distinctly nodular, and at the time of autopsy we wondered whether it was a broken-down carcinoma, with the formation of a large abscess. This nodule, too, turned out to be a walled-off abscess, with no evidence of carcinoma. Although an adjacent small pulmonary artery contained an organized thrombus, I'm not at all sure that the thrombosis was due to an embolus; it may have been secondary to the pneumonitis, as often occurs.Therefore, the patient probably had an aspiration pneumonia, as Dr. Bird indicated, with breakdown forming the abscesses. The original injury seven months before death almost certainly led to the femoral-vein thrombosis and eventually the pulmonary emboli and infarcts.There was mild chronic passive congestion in the liver. The heart was not greatly enlarged, and the coronary arteries were patent. The presence of diabetes was confirmed by the finding of marked sclerosis of the islands of Langerhans. Examination of the spine demonstrated the very severe osteoarthritis, with marked proliferation and spur formation. The bone was mildly osteoporotic. The brain weighed 1180 gm., and microscopical examination revealed merely mild atrophy. There were no distinctive lesions of any sort.Dr. Bird: What is the explanation of the flaccidity?Dr. Castleman: I really don't have any answer. There was certainly nothing in the brain to account for it, and the fact that the patient became alert while in the hospital probably means that it was just a temporary derangement.\n",

      "question": "A 70-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of peripheral edema.\nHe was well until one year earlier, when he noticed slight ankle edema, which disappeared after a brief course of diuretic medication. One month before entry edema recurred, accompanied by confusion. A physician found hypertension and proteinuria and again prescribed a diuretic, without benefit. Ten days before admission the patient was seen at the clinic. The blood pressure was 180/95 mm Hg, and + + + peripheral edema was noted; the urea nitrogen was 57 mg, and the creatinine 2.4 mg per 100 ml. Hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg daily, was prescribed, but the edema increased. For several days before entry his urinary volume was diminished.\nTwo days before admission an intravenous pyelographic examination showed calcification in the abdominal aorta, which was not dilated, and phleboliths in the pelvis; renal excretion was diminished bilaterally; on the 20-minute films there was faint opacification of calyxes on both sides; the left kidney was 13.6 by 6.5 cm, and the right kidney 12.5 by 6.0 cm; the renal contours appeared normal; the ureters were not opacified; there was minimal trabeculation of the bladder wall, with elevation of the floor by an enlarged prostate gland. One day before entry facial edema was observed. He fell and scraped his arm and was admitted to the hospital.\nThe patient had retired from his position as a printer five years previously. There was a long history of parkinsonism, treated with levodopa, trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride and amantadine hydrochloride. A myocardial infarct had been treated at home 20 years before entry. For 10 years he had experienced exertional angina, accompanied by exertional dyspnea and nocturia. There was no history of renal disease, recent pharyngitis, diabetes mellitus, gout, arthritis or exposure to nephrotoxic agents.\nThe temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 88, and the respirations 16. The blood pressure was 170/90 mm Hg.\nOn examination he appeared well except for a resting tremor. Ecchymoses and abrasions were observed about the left forearm, and there was livido reticularis over both legs. The jugular venous pressure was less than 5 cm (confirmed by a central venous line). Dullness and a few fine rales were heard at both lung bases. The heart was not enlarged, and the rhythm was regular; a Grade 1 early systolic ejection murmur was heard at the cardiac apex and along the left sternal border; no S3 sound or pericardial friction rub was present. Abdominal examination was negative; the kidneys were not felt. Examination of the extremities disclosed + + + + peripheral edema that extended to the sacral area. Rectal examination revealed considerable enlargement of the prostate gland, which was smooth and soft. Neurologic examination was negative aside from a prominent tremor. He was disoriented as to time and place, but his conversation was fluent.\nThe urine gave a + + + + test for protein and had a specific gravity of 1.032; the sediment contained 30 white cells, 10 red cells and occasional finely granular casts per high-power field. The hematocrit was 34.5 per cent; the white-cell count was 14,000, with 76 per cent neutrophils, 15 per cent lymphocytes, 6 per cent monocytes and 3 per cent eosinophils. The platelet count was 330,000. The prothrombin time was normal. The urea nitrogen was 90 mg, the creatinine 5 mg, the glucose 93 mg, the cholesterol 236 mg, the uric acid 10.4 mg, the calcium 8.6 mg, the phosphorus 6.3 mg, the iron 74 \u03bcg, the iron-binding capacity 252 \u03bcg, and the protein 5.9 g (the albumin 3.4 g, and the globulin 2.5 g) per 100 ml. The sodium was 141 meq, the potassium 5.4 meq, the chloride 99 meq, and the carbon dioxide 23 meq per liter. The glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) was 13 U, the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 224 U, the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 100 U, and the amylase 10 U. An electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal rhythm at a rate of 95, with nonspecific ST-segment abnormalities. An x-ray film of the chest revealed that the heart was at the upper limit of normal in size; there were small bilateral pleural effusions; the pulmonary vessels were slightly congested; there was minimal thickening of the pleura at the apex of the right lung. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing room air, disclosed that the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO\n2\n) was 81 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO\n2\n) 35 mm Hg, and the pH 7.38. A culture of an abraded area of the left forearm yielded an abundant growth of\nStaphylococcus epidermidis\n. A culture of urine and four blood cultures yielded no micro-organisms. Three stool specimens gave negative tests for occult blood. After the patient voided 50 ml of urine catheterization of the bladder revealed a residual volume of 10 ml. A bone-marrow aspiration disclosed 5 per cent plasma cells and a few megaloblasts. Serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a mild decrease in IgG and a mild increase in IgA; IgM was within normal limits. Agarose-gel serum electrophoresis gave a normal pattern, with a decrease in globulin. An immunoelectrophoretic study of a 50-fold concentrated specimen of urine showed no Bence-Jones protein. The selective protein index, measured as the ratio of the renal clearance of IgG to the clearance of transferrin, was 0.01. The complement was 200 U (normal, 150 to 250 U). A test for antinuclear antibodies was negative.\nThe patient was given a diet that contained 2 g of sodium, infusions of salt-poor albumin, furosemide, digoxin and a sodium polystyrene sulfonate resin by mouth; anti-parkinsonian medications were omitted. Repeated bouts of substernal pain responded to nitroglycerin. The peripheral edema gradually diminished, and examination of the lungs disclosed progressive clearing. On the third hospital day the 24-hour urinary volume was 1615 ml. The creatinine clearance was 30 liters in 24 hours, and the urinary protein excretion was 11 g. The urea nitrogen was 105 mg, the creatinine 5.7 mg, and the protein 5.4 g per 100 ml. Serum electrophoresis showed that the albumin was 53 per cent, the alpha\n1\nglobulin 7 per cent, the alpha\n2\nglobulin 10 per cent, the beta globulin 16 per cent, and the gamma globulin 14 per cent. On the fifth hospital day the 24-hour urinary volume attained a peak of 2150 ml. The SGOT was 25 U, the LDH 215 U, the CPK 65 U, and the aldolase 12.2 U. An attempted inferior venacavagraphic examination was discontinued because the patient was unable to co-operate.\nOn the seventh hospital day the patient was less confused. The 24-hour urinary volume was 1080 ml, and the urinary protein excretion 29 g. The urea nitrogen was 94 mg, and the creatinine 3.1 mg per 100 ml. The intravenous administration of fluids was discontinued. On the ninth hospital day the 24-hour urinary volume fell to 400 ml. On the 11th hospital day a repeated x-ray film of the chest showed that the pulmonary edema had cleared. On the 12th hospital day the 24-hour urinary volume was 650 ml, and the urinary protein excretion 11 g. The urea nitrogen was 144 mg, and the creatinine 5.2 mg per 100 ml.\nOn the 14th hospital day an open renal biopsy was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Burton D. Rose\\*: In summary, this 70-year-old man had four major problems. The first was chronic Parkinson's disease. The second was coronary-artery disease, manifested by the history of myocardial infarction 20 years previously, exertional angina and symptoms of mild congestive heart failure. The third problem was renal failure with proteinuria of questionable duration. We are told that the edema began one year before admission but then disappeared spontaneously. I'm tempted to say that the edema at that time was related to the cardiac disease, and that the renal problem began one month before admission, with the onset of edema, proteinuria and hypertension. The fourth problem, of course, was edema.In evaluating proteinuria one should first realize that proteins are normally handled in two basic ways by the kidneys. Larger proteins, such as albumin with a molecular weight of 69,000, are filtered to a very limited degree,[1](#core-r001) whereas proteins of lower molecular weight, under 50,000, such as immunoglobulin light chains and lysozyme, are filtered more freely but are then almost entirely reabsorbed by the proximal tubular cells.[2](#core-r002) The net result is the daily excretion by normal adults of less than 150 mg of protein. Thus, there are two basic mechanisms for excessive proteinuria.[3](#core-r003) One is tubular proteinuria, which is characterized by excessive excretion of proteins of low molecular weight. This form may occur when there is overproduction of proteins so that the proximal reabsorptive capacity is overwhelmed, as in patients with multiple myeloma or acute myelogenous leukemia,[4,5](#core-r004) or when proximal tubular function is impaired, as in the Fanconi syndrome.[6](#core-r006) One way to detect these proteins clinically is by testing the urine not only with the dipstick, which detects principally albumin, but also with sulfosalicylic acid, which detects all proteins. Thus, in patients with tubular proteinuria there is often a marked disparity between the dipstick test, which may be negative or just trace-positive, and the sulfosalicylic acid test, which may be + + + +.[7](#core-r007) In this case the test for Bence-Jones protein was negative, and it seems unlikely that any of the other causes of tubular proteinuria were present. Although we don't know that the urinary protein was mostly albumin, I shall assume that this patient had glomerular proteinuria, in which the major problem is an increase in the permeability of the glomerular capillary wall, resulting in increased filtration and subsequent excretion of the proteins of higher molecular weight.It is important to know how much protein was excreted since this information helps to differentiate primary glomerular diseases from tubular, interstitial and obstructive diseases, in which the degree of proteinuria is usually mild. If a patient excretes more than 3.5 g per 24 hours per 1.73 m2 some form of glomerular disease is probably present. Since this patient started with a daily protein excretion of 11 g he certainly had a glomerular disease, which was associated with the nephrotic syndrome. The characteristic findings in the nephrotic syndrome are protein excretion in excess of 3.5 g per 24 hours per 1.73 m2, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hypercholesterolemia. However, the last three findings are secondary to the protein excretion and are not present in all patients. The development of hypoalbuminemia depends on the failure of the liver to increase production to an extent sufficient to replace the urinary losses. In this patient the serum albumin value was 3.4 g per 100 ml, which is slightly less than normal. The associated hypercholesterolemia appears to be due to increased hepatic synthesis, which may also be related to hypoalbuminemia. In experimental studies in nephrotic animals the infusion of dextran or albumin, which raises the plasma oncotic pressure, markedly reduces the lipid concentration in the blood.[8,9](#core-r008) The cholesterol level in this patient was close to normal, which is not surprising in view of the relatively normal albumin level. Finally, the edema, which is usually due to hypoalbuminemia, is also proportional to salt intake.The nephrotic syndrome has many causes. What can we find in the case record to help in pinpointing the cause in this patient? The first point, which I believe is not helpful, is the serum immunoglobulin pattern. Decreased IgG is a common finding with all forms of the nephrotic syndrome.[10](#core-r010) The reason is not clear, although loss of IgG in the urine may be a contributory factor. The increase in IgA may be non-specific, but it has been reported with increased frequency in association with IgA nephropathy and with Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura.[11,12](#core-r011) The second clue is the selective protein index, which was initially described by Cameron and Blandford[13](#core-r013) and is used to determine the size of proteins appearing in the urine, thus providing some indication of how much of an increase in glomerular permeability is present. Calculation of the selectivity index involves comparing the clearance of IgG, which has a molecular weight of 160,000, to the clearance of transferrin, with a molecular weight of 88,000. A patient with highly selective proteinuria clears principally the smaller molecules and has a selectivity index of less than 0.1; with non-selective proteinuria this ratio is more than 0.2, as relatively more IgG is lost in the urine. The main value of this test is that a high selectivity index is generally associated with mild histologic changes and a steroid-responsive disease. This correlation is particularly true in children, in whom a high selectivity usually indicates minimal-change disease and a greater than 90 per cent positive response to steroids.[14](#core-r014) In adults, however, highly selective proteinuria is less specific and less often associated with a good response to steroids.[14](#core-r014) In this case we have an index of 0.01, indicating extremely selective proteinuria. In studies in adults with the nephrotic syndrome Cameron and his associates found a selectivity of less than 0.05 in only four of 33 patients with minimal-change disease, in two of 53 patients with membranous nephropathy and in none of 33 patients with amyloidosis or focal glomerulosclerosis.[14\u201317](#core-r014) Therefore, this degree of selectivity, although slightly favoring minimal-change disease, is so uncommon in any form of the adult nephrotic syndrome that it does not provide diagnostic information.Three findings in this case are helpful \u2014 the abnormalities found on the urinalysis, the rapid course of the renal failure and the distribution of the edema. When trying to differentiate among the various causes of the nephrotic syndrome one should distinguish between what might be called \"nephritic\" and \"nephrotic\" sediments. In a nephritic sediment one sees red cells, red-cell casts, white cells and other types of cast in addition to protein in the urine. In contrast, the patients with the \"pure\" nephrotic syndrome have increased protein excretion as the principal abnormality. The sediment may contain white cells and a few red cells but not numerous casts; oval fat bodies and free fat droplets may be present. In this case the urinary sediment revealed only 10 red cells per high-power field and a few casts, more compatible with a nephrotic sediment.Five major disorders are associated with a nephrotic sediment. The first is minimal-change disease, which is the cause in 80 to 90 per cent of the cases of the nephrotic syndrome in children but in only 10 to 20 per cent of those in adults.[18](#core-r018) The highly selective proteinuria in this case is in favor of minimal-change disease, but the rapid development of renal failure is against that diagnosis. Even in adults minimal-change disease tends to be relatively benign.[15](#core-r015) The progression to renal failure that occurred in this case is very unusual in the absence of diuretic-induced hypovolemia or severe hypoalbuminemia,[19](#core-r019) neither of which was a factor in this patient. Diabetes mellitus is the second cause of the nephrotic syndrome and can be excluded in this case by the normal blood glucose value and the absence of a history of diabetes. The third cause is focal glomerulosclerosis, again a disease that occurs principally in children and is very unusual in patients over the age of 60 years.[17,20](#core-r017) It is characterized by areas of sclerosis, occurring mainly in the juxtamedullary glomeruli. Thus, if a closed biopsy is done and only the outer cortex is obtained one may not see these changes and may be unable to distinguish focal glomerulosclerosis from minimal-change disease. In view of this patient's age, I think that focal glomerulosclerosis is unlikely. The fourth cause of the nephrotic syndrome is amyloidosis. With the lack of evidence of a chronic inflammatory disease one would have to assume that if this patient had amyloidosis it was the primary form. In a large review of cases of primary amyloidosis by Triger and Joekes[21](#core-r021) there was little clinical evidence of involvement of organs other than the kidney in many of the patients, even though the post-mortem examination revealed widespread involvement. Thus, amyloidosis is a possibility in this case. The patient's age is compatible with it. However, 80 to 90 per cent of the patients with the primary form of amyloidosis have an abnormal immunoglobulin either in the serum as a monoclonal spike or in the urine as Bence-Jones protein.[22,23](#core-r022) Therefore, the absence of Bence-Jones protein in the urine and of an abnormal paraprotein on serum protein electrophoresis makes this diagnosis unlikely. The last entity that is typically associated with a nephrotic sediment is membranous nephropathy.[16](#core-r016) This disorder accounted for approximately 50 per cent of the adult cases of the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in the Cooperative study headed by Dr. Cecil H. Coggins, at this hospital. There are many causes of membranous nephropathy in adults, including systemic lupus erythematosus, drugs, hepatitis B infection and carcinoma. The last is particularly interesting since it has been estimated that in 10 per cent of adult patients with the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome an underlying carcinoma will prove to be responsible for it.[24](#core-r024)Therefore, on the basis of the findings in the urinary sediment one would say that membranous nephropathy and perhaps amyloidosis were the most likely causes of the nephrotic syndrome in this patient. However, although both disorders may progress to renal failure, neither is associated with the rapid deterioration in renal function that occurred. One month before admission edema was noted, 10 days before admission the creatinine was 2.4 mg, and on the day of admission the creatinine was 5 mg per 100 ml, with a slight continued rise thereafter. This course suggests that if either membranous nephropathy or amyloidosis was present a superimposed event was responsible for the acute renal failure. Three such events could have occurred in this case. One is spontaneous atheroembolism, a possibility that is suggested by the calcification in the aorta. However, that complication is relatively rare, and we have no evidence indicating embolism elsewhere, such as areas of cyanosis or infarction of the digits. The second possibility is a reaction to radiocontrast medium. Two days before entry the patient underwent an intravenous pyelographic study. It is important to be aware of the frequency of renal failure after the injection of radiocontrast agents. It occurs most often in diabetic patients with renal disease, with a frequency in that setting as high as 90 per cent, but it may occur in any patient.[25,26](#core-r025) We have recently reviewed 100 consecutive cases of acute renal failure at our hospital, and in nine of them it was due to contrast agents. However, two findings are against that diagnosis in this case. The first is that the oliguria developed before the intravenous pyelographic examination. Secondly, in most patients with a dye reaction improvement in renal function begins within three to 10 days,[25](#core-r025) whereas in this case there was no evidence of improvement or even stabilization of the renal function 14 days later. The final possibility is the superimposition of renal-vein thrombosis, and I shall return to that consideration.Since none of these diseases are entirely consistent with the rapid downhill course in this case, I shall turn briefly to a consideration of disorders associated with a nephritic sediment, even though the findings in the urinary sediment were not characteristic of these disorders. The first possibility is rapidly progressive, or crescentic, glomerulonephritis. The rapid course in this case is certainly compatible with that disease, which may be idiopathic or may occur in Good-pasture's syndrome, in association with a variety of collagen vascular diseases or in cases of membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis.[27,28](#core-r027) The major point against this diagnosis, in addition to the sediment, is the severity of the nephrotic syndrome. Urinary protein excretion as high as 11 to 29 g would be very unusual in a patient with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.[28](#core-r028) The second possibility is one of the hypocomplementemic forms of glomerulonephritis, but the combination of a normal comlement level with the findings in the sediment makes diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, mixed cryoglobulinemia and bacterial endocarditis unlikely causes of the renal failure in this case. *Staph. epidermidis* was cultured from the skin, but blood cultures were negative. Moreover, the abrasion of the arm occurred only one day before admission and could not have had a role in the renal failure. Two other diseases deserve mention. One is IgA nephropathy, or Berger's disease.[29](#core-r029) Elevation of the serum IgA, which was found in this case, is common in patients with that disease.[11](#core-r011) However, the course differs from that in this case. The nephrotic syndrome may occur but is unusual. The patients usually have microscopic hematuria, episodes of macroscopic hematuria and a benign course. Berger et al.[30](#core-r030) have reported that renal failure eventually develops in about 20 per cent of adult patients with this disease, but it is a very indolent form of renal failure, not acute as in this patient.The last category to be discussed is vasculitis, which is most often associated with a nephritic sediment. In the absence of lung or sinus involvement there is little evidence to support a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.[31](#core-r031) Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura is an intriguing possibility because patients with this disorder may have an elevated IgA level and can present with a pure nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. However, the lack of purpura, abdominal pain and arthralgia makes that diagnosis improbable.[32](#core-r032) Allergic granulomatous angiitis, as described by Churg and Strauss,[33](#core-r033) is also unlikely in the absence of fever, asthma and eosinophilia. Finally, polyarteritis nodosa should be considered. There appear to be two varieties \u2014 the classic or macroscopic form and the microscopic form, also called the hypersensitivity angiitis of Zeek.[34](#core-r034) In the macroscopic form the mediumsized arteries are usually involved. The patients most commonly present with multisystem involvement, particularly mononeuritis multiplex.[35](#core-r035) Since large vessels are involved there may be signs or symptoms resulting from infarction, such as episodes of flank pain and gross hematuria. However, the nephrotic syndrome is uncommon in this form of polyarteritis. The diagnosis can sometimes be made by means of an arteriographie study since narrowing, beading and microaneurysms in the medium-sized vessels are virtually pathognomonic. The microscopic form is characterized by involvement of small vessels and in the kidney by focal glomerular necrosis and sclerosis. The nephrotic syndrome may occur with only minimal hematuria. Eosinophilia is common; in this case the eosinophil count, as I calculate it, was borderline at 420 per cubic millimeter. There is usually involvement of other organs, although it may not be apparent clinically. Is there evidence of involvement of other organs in this case? It is conceivable that the angina that occurred while the patient was in the hospital reflected coronary vasculitis, although that interpretation seems unlikely. In addition, he became confused and had livedo reticularis, a disorder that is associated with arteriolar constriction. There was also evidence of muscle damage, with an increase in the muscle enzymes, LDH, CPK and aldolase, all of which could have been associated with a microscopic vasculitis. However, the patient was receiving amantadine for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Amantadine is excreted principally by glomerular filtration and therefore tends to accumulate if renal failure develops. Among the toxic side effects reported are livedo reticularis, confusion and an elevated SGOT, which may be due to muscle damage.[36](#core-r036) Although amantadine probably was responsible for the extrarenal manifestations in this patient, the microscopic form of polyarteritis remains a possible diagnosis.However, the marked edema in this case points to another disorder. Edema formation is due to the movement of fluid from the vascular space into the interstitium. According to Starling's law, this movement is proportional to the hydrostatic and oncotic pressure gradients and the permeability of the capillary wall. Small changes in either of Starling's forces generally will not produce edema because of safety factors that protect against it. Perhaps the most important one is that as more fluid is filtered across the wall lymphatic flow is able to increase and return the filtrate to the systemic circulation. In addition, increasing filtration of fluid tends to raise the interstitial hydrostatic pressure and by dilution to lower the interstitial oncotic pressure, both of which retard further edema formation. As a result, when edema is due to hypoalbuminemia there is usually a considerable reduction in the serum albumin level to less than 2.5 g per 100 ml. This observation was first made by Darrow et al.[37](#core-r037) and Moore and Van Slyke[38](#core-r038) in separate studies in the 1930's and was confirmed by Schreiner[39](#core-r039) in a study of 150 patients with the nephrotic syndrome and edema. In Schreiner's series there were 35 patients with the nephrotic syndrome who had sacral edema; in those patients the mean albumin concentration was less than 2 g, and only two of them had an albumin concentration greater than 3 g per 100 ml. There was no information whether those patients also had renal failure or congestive heart failure. In the case under discussion the albumin was 3.4 g on admission and later was 2.9 g per 100 ml, as calculated from the serum protein electrophoresis, and both values seem too high to explain the degree of edema observed. Other possible causes of the edema in this case are congestive failure, which results in fluid retention and an increase in the venous hydrostatic pressure, and renal failure, which causes a diminished excretion of the daily salt and water intake. In both those conditions, though, edema should be associated with a high venous pressure, whereas on the physical examination the jugular venous pressure was less than 5 cm, a finding that was confirmed by a central-venous-pressure line. Thus, it's hard to implicate an increase in hydrostatic pressure due to either heart failure or renal failure as the additional cause of the edema in this patient. I find no evidence of lymphatic obstruction or an increase in capillary permeability. Although polyarteritis can result in increased capillary permeability it is usually focal, so that the associated petechiae are raised because small amounts of plasma leak out into the lesions. Diffuse edema as described in this patient is unlikely in association with polyarteritis.The diagnosis that may well explain all the findings in this case is inferior-vena-cava and renal-vein thrombosis. It has been suggested that this possibility should be suspected in any patient with the nephrotic syndrome if the degree of hypoalbuminemia is insufficient to account for the degree of peripheral edema. The association of the nephrotic syndrome with renal-vein or inferior-vena-cava thrombosis has been well documented.[40\u201342](#core-r040) There has long been controversy whether the nephrotic syndrome or the renal-vein thrombosis is primary, and most of the evidence now favors the view that the former is the initial event. First of all, in experimental studies and in human beings with no renal disease occlusion of the inferior vena cava or the renal veins results in only a slight increase in protein excretion without the nephrotic syndrome.[43](#core-r043) Secondly, one of the forms of the nephrotic syndrome that has been reported to be an example of the effects of increased renal venous pressure is that associated with right-sided heart failure, particularly constrictive pericarditis. However, in a study of four cases of this rare disorder Burack et al.[44](#core-r044) found no correlation between the degree of edema and the central venous pressure, suggesting that other factors are important. Bohrer et al.[45](#core-r045) recently presented evidence suggesting that the increase in the filtration fraction that occurs with heart failure and is possibly mediated by angiotensin II or catecholamines may be responsible for the associated increase in protein excretion. Finally, there are reports of patients with the nephrotic syndrome who initially had negative inferior venacavagraphic studies but subsequently had renal-vein thrombosis.[41,42](#core-r041) Therefore, the evidence suggests that in most of the cases renal-vein thrombosis is secondary to the nephrotic syndrome. The explanation for this sequence appears to involve the presence of a hypercoagulable state. An increase in platelets, fibrinogen and clotting factors, particularly factor VIII, has been observed in association with the increased frequency of arterial and venous thrombi in patients with the nephrotic syndrome.[46](#core-r046) However, there is some question whether these minor clotting abnormalities are sufficient to account for the increased frequency of thrombosis. Kauffmann et al.[47](#core-r047) recently studied a patient with the nephrotic syndrome in whom they demonstrated low antithrombin III levels due to the loss of this substance in the urine and suggested that it could be responsible for the increased coagulability in such cases. Since the renal venous blood would be the most coagulable in this circumstance this finding would also explain the increased frequency of renal-vein thrombosis.Renal-vein thrombosis has been reported in association with all forms of the nephrotic syndrome but has been most common with membranous nephropathy and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.[42](#core-r042) Llach et al.[41,42](#core-r041) estimated that renal-vein thrombosis develops in as many as 30 to 50 per cent of the patients with membranous nephropathy, but a lower frequency has been reported by others.[48](#core-r048) Contributing to this thrombotic tendency in rare cases may be the presence of carcinomatous lymph nodes or direct invasion of a renal-cell carcinoma, since there is an association of a variety of solid tumors with membranous nephropathy.One should suspect the diagnosis of renal-vein thrombosis in three circumstances \u2014 the onset of flank pain, particularly if acute, the presence of pulmonary emboli and marked variability in protein excretion. This patient did not have flank pain. It is possible that the small pleural effusions and increased frequency of angina in the hospital reflected multiple small pulmonary emboli, but the lack of pleuritic pain, the clearing of the pleural effusions with diuretics and the normal PaO2 of 81 mm Hg with the patient breathing room air are against that diagnosis. There was marked variability in the excretion of protein, which was 11 g on the third hospital day, 29 g on the seventh day and back to 11 g on the 12th day. However, it is noteworthy that the patient was given albumin infusions, which by raising the serum albumin concentration and therefore the amount of filtered albumin can explain the variations in the protein excretion.[49](#core-r049) The effect of albumin infusions to increase the plasma volume could also account for the transient improvement that was observed on the seventh hospital day, when the creatinine level, which had increased from 5 to 5.7 mg, was down to 3.1 mg per 100 ml. With discontinuation of the salt-poor albumin the urinary output fell, and the creatinine level rose to 5.2 mg per 100 ml.The diagnosis of renal-vein thrombosis can be suggested by an intravenous pyelographic study. If it occurs acutely the films may show a large kidney with very poor function. In this setting hemorrhagic infarction may develop, resulting in gross hematuria. If renal-vein thrombosis develops slowly, as it would have to have done in this patient, there is time for the development of collateral circulation, with a return to normal of the renal size, and the only finding on intravenous pyelograms may be notching of the ureters due to pressure from the collateral vessels. In this patient the ureters were not visualized on the intravenous pyelograms. The confirmation of the diagnosis, of course, is made by an inferior venacavagraphic examination, which was attempted but not completed in this case.Thus, it is possible that membranous nephropathy with associated renal-vein and inferior-vena-cava thrombosis is the explanation of both the edema and the renal failure in this patient. I pick membranous nephropathy rather than amyloidosis or minimal-change disease mainly on statistical grounds; membranous nephropathy is both the most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome in adults and the disorder most frequently complicated by renal-vein thrombosis. The histologic changes may have been those of membranous nephropathy with or without interstitial edema and fibrosis and margination of leukocytes.[41](#core-r041) Nevertheless, two factors are against this diagnosis. The first is that inferior-vena-cava thrombosis is relatively uncommon in patients with renal-vein thrombosis. The second is that although the renal function typically decreases with the acute onset of renal-vein thrombosis it is usually not affected by chronic renal-vein thrombosis.[41,42](#core-r041) For example, in one patient with unilateral renal-vein thrombosis split-function studies revealed that the protein excretion, glomerular filtration rate, sodium excretion and protein selectivity were the same on both sides.[47](#core-r047)In summary, this patient presented with the unusual combination of the nephrotic syndrome and acute renal failure. There is not enough evidence to make a definitive diagnosis on the basis of the clinical findings, and a renal biopsy was clearly indicated. Because of the low central venous pressure and the relatively normal serum albumin concentration my first diagnosis is renal-vein and inferior-vena-cava thrombosis complicating membranous nephropathy. My second choice would be the microscopic form of polyarteritis, a diagnosis that is particularly important because steroid therapy may be dramatically effective in reversing the course of the disease.Dr. Robert T. McCluskey: Dr. Herrin, you were involved with this patient and have considerable experience with the value of selectivity indexes. Will you comment on that aspect of the case?Dr. John T. Herrin: The selective protein index was performed in my laboratory as the ratio of clearance of IgG to clearance of transferrin. Values of less than 0.1 are usually the result of a low urinary IgG level. The proteinuria in this case was certainly highly selective. Protein selectivity correlates better with steroid responsiveness than with any particular histologic pattern. Statistically, the lower numerical values of the selectivity index are associated with lesser degrees of histologic damage. Certainly, one would expect most patients with a membranous nephropathy or amyloidosis to have a less selective pattern than the one found in this case. In fact, the value measured is similar to that associated with the minimal-change lesions seen in childhood. In the childhood nephrotic syndrome renal failure in the presence of the minimal-change lesion is uncommon unless there is considerable hypovolemia secondary to diuretic therapy and salt restriction. Both factors were present in this patient.Dr. Rose: The diuretics certainly could have been responsible for the deterioration in renal function before admission. However, since the diuretics were ineffective in reducing the patient's weight it would be hard to make the diagnosis of diuretic-induced volume depletion.Dr. McCluskey: Dr. Zusman, do you have the opinion of the medical students on this case?Dr. Randall M. Zusman: For the first time in quite a while the students disagreed with the discusser. They came to the conclusion that the diagnosis was renal amyloidosis on the basis of the patient's age, the selectivity of the proteinuria and the lack of evidence for involvement of any other organ system. The sudden deterioration of renal function that occurred on the ninth hospital day was attributed to acute renal-vein thrombosis.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Robert B. Colvin: This case presented a clinical dilemma before the biopsy was done. The physicians taking care of the patient at the time favored the possibility of amyloidosis, with or without renal-vein thrombosis, but believed that a renal biopsy was necessary to establish the diagnosis.In the open-renal-biopsy specimen the vessels appeared normal. The interstitium was the site of patchy edema with only a sparse infiltrate of mononuclear cells, which did not warrant a diagnosis of interstitial nephritis. Examination of the tubules showed dilatation of the lumens, thinning of tubular cells and increased cytoplasmic basophilia and prominence of nucleoli in the lining cells. Evidence of regeneration was seen in a few tubules, with mitotic activity ([Fig. 1](#f001)). No necrosis of the tubular cells was found on the light-microscope examination, although the electron-microscope examination revealed necrosis of occasional lining cells. We interpret these changes as secondary to acute tubular necrosis, probably ischemic in origin. On light-microscope examination the glomeruli appeared almost normal, with only slight mesangial hypercellularity and increased matrix ([Fig. 2](#f002)). There were occasional neutrophils in the capillary lumens, a finding that has been associated with the presence of renal-vein thrombosis.[41](#core-r041) No crescents or areas of necrosis were found, and there were only a few globally sclerotic glomeruli, probably related to the patient's age. The juxtaglomerular complexes were somewhat prominent, and an incidental finding, which is truly rare in our experience, was a mitosis in one juxtaglomerular complex, presumably related to a compensatory response to the hypovolemia.Immunofluorescence stains for IgG, IgM, IgA and C3 were negative; these findings exclude membranous glomerulonephritis (or nephropathy, as Dr. Rose refers to it), since that disease is characterized by granular deposition of immunoglobulin and complement in a subepithelial location in the capillary walls. Although there were no segmental lesions characteristic of focal glomerulosclerosis in our sample the possibility of this disease cannot be excluded on morphologic grounds. The subsequent response to corticosteroids, which I shall describe later, argues against that diagnosis. We are left with a choice among very mild diabetes, very mild amyloidosis and minimal-change disease, and for this differential diagnosis electronmicroscopical examination is valuable. Two glomeruli were examined with the electron microscope. The glomerular capillary basement membrane appeared normal except for a slight accumulation of amorphous electron-lucent material underneath the endothelium. We found no electron-dense or fibrillar deposits and no appreciable basement-membrane thickening. The important finding was diffuse loss of the epithelial foot processes, accompanied by an increased number of villi and organelles in the podocytes ([Fig. 3](#f003)). This change occurs with most forms of proteinuria. Because we found no deposits and no evidence of diabetes or amyloidosis we conclude that this is an example of what is known as lipoid nephrosis, or minimal-change disease.This disease is much more common in children but can cause a nephrotic syndrome in older persons, as this case illustrates. The association of the nephrotic syndrome with malignant tumors is one of some interest. Unfortunately, there are no adequate statistical studies that establish a direct relation. The few cases studied for the presence of tumor antigens have been cases of membranous glomerulonephritis associated with carcinoma.[24,50](#core-r024) Minimal-change disease has been associated with lymphoma, especially Hodgkin's disease.[24,50](#core-r024) In the present case there was no evidence of lymphoma.I can give some further information about the subsequent hospital course. From the pathological findings in the biopsy specimen renal-vein thrombosis was still considered a leading possibility by the attending physicians, and an inferior venacavagraphic study was done two days after the biopsy. The inferior vena cava and both renal veins were patent, and there was rapid flow in both renal veins, thus excluding thrombosis. One week after the biopsy prednisone, 40 mg per day, was begun, and he was discharged two weeks later on 30 mg per day. During that time the creatinine fell from a high of 5.8 to 4.1 mg per 100 ml, and the urinary protein excretion decreased from 35 to 9.5 g per day. The steroid dose was decreased progressively, and when the patient was seen in the clinic four months later the creatinine was 0.9 mg, the urea nitrogen was 23 mg, there was only + protein in the urine, and the serum albumin was 3.9 g per 100 ml. The edema was markedly reduced, although he still had + ankle edema. The renal disease was considered resolved by his physicians at that time. This prompt response to steroids and the very selective proteinuria further support the diagnosis of lipoid nephrosis.Dr. Rose: Could the renal failure have been due to the acute tubular necrosis?Dr. Colvin: We have no evidence of any other process, and I believe that that is the best explanation. The pathogenesis of acute ischemic injury, or acute tubular necrosis, in this setting is uncertain. The occurrence of acute renal failure in a patient with lipoid nephrosis is unusual but not unprecedented. In 1968 Connolly et al.[19](#core-r019) reported three cases of their own and two more from the literature of adults aged 40 years or over who had lipoid nephrosis and renal failure. The renal failure in those five patients persisted from seven to 114 days but then resolved completely in all the cases, as did the proteinuria. The patients were treated with steroids, but that therapy was not necessarily responsible for the recovery since the proteinuria can recover spontaneously. Even in an older patient with renal failure and the nephrotic syndrome one must seriously consider the diagnosis of lipoid nephrosis.Dr. Rose: I am not certain that the patients described by Connolly et al. are applicable to this case since all of them either became volume depleted or had severe hypoalbuminemia,[19](#core-r019) whereas this patient had neither.\n",

      "question": "A 76-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of chest pain.\nThere was a history of sarcoidosis, diagnosed by biopsy 16 years earlier, with cervical and hilar lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and pancytopenia; skin tests with histoplasmin and PPD (1 TU) were negative. Nineteen months before admission a modified right radical mastectomy was performed because of an infiltrating ductal carcinoma; microscopical examination disclosed that all 13 lymph nodes sampled were free of tumor; three of them contained noncaseating granulomas; one Schaumann body was observed. Two weeks before entry symptoms of an upper-respiratory-tract infection and a sore throat developed. Five days before admission she began to have right pleuritic pain with a nonproductive cough, night sweats and anorexia.\nThere was no history of previous chest pain, exertional dyspnea, peripheral edema, fever, chills or night sweats.\nThe temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, the pulse 70, and the respirations 15. The blood pressure was 190/70 mm Hg, and the weight was 45 kg.\nOn examination the patient appeared frail and chronically ill. She was edentulous; the throat was normal. No peripheral lymphadenopathy was found, and the jugular venous pressure was normal. The left breast was normal. Scattered rales were audible at both lung bases; no friction rub was heard. The heart was normal. Prominent veins were observed above the umbilicus; the liver was palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen 5 cm below the left. There was no peripheral edema, clubbing or cyanosis.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 36.1 per cent; the white-cell count was 2600, with 59 per cent neutrophils, 12 per cent lymphocytes, 23 per cent monocytes and 6 per cent eosinophils. The platelet count was 93,000. The prothrombin time was normal; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 66 mm per hour. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The urea nitrogen was 9 mg, the glucose 79 mg, the uric acid 4.3 mg, the bilirubin 0.7 mg, the calcium 9.7 mg, the phosphorus 1.9 mg, and the protein 7.0 g (the albumin 3.7 g, and the globulin 3.3 g) per 100 ml. The glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) was 28 U, the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 125 U, the amylase 18 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 4.6 Bodansky U. An electrocardiogram was unchanged from a tracing obtained four years earlier. X-ray films of the chest (\nFig. 1\n) with decubitus views revealed bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and hilar lymph-node calcifications that were unchanged in comparison with earlier studies; interstitial perihilar scarring and numerous small nodular lesions were distributed throughout both lung fields, also without change; there was slight loss of volume in the right lower lobe; bilateral small pleural effusions were noted; the heart was enlarged, with a cardiothoracic ratio of 14.5:26. A\n99m\nTc methylene diphosphonate bone scan demonstrated a normal appearance of the bones.\nThe patient was given ferrous sulfate and a soft-solid diet. Pleuritic pain persisted. Repeated examinations disclosed no change. The temperature rose as high as 37.8 to 38.5\u00b0C during the first five days in the hospital and was normal thereafter. On the fifth hospital day a pericardial friction rub was heard. Examination of the abdomen revealed enlargement of the liver and spleen; the supraumbilical veins appeared more prominent. An x-ray film of the chest showed a slight increase in the pleural effusions. On the next day the patient passed maroon stools that gave ++++ tests for occult blood. The hematocrit fell to 24.5 per cent; the white-cell count was 5800. Three transfusions were administered.\nOn the seventh hospital day the hematocrit was 33 per cent. Fiberoptic endoscopic examination showed large, thin-walled esophageal varices and a hiatus hernia containing gastric varices; the mucosa of the body of the stomach was atrophic, and no blood was observed; the duodenal bulb and postbulbar portion of the duodenum appeared normal; no site of bleeding was visible. A barium-enema examination was cancelled because of the patient's fragile state. On the eighth hospital day she complained of pain in the left side of the chest and the left upper abdominal quadrant. Examination disclosed tenderness over the enlarged spleen and liver. The hematocrit was 37.4 per cent, the LDH 128 U, and the haptoglobin 156 mg per 100 ml; a direct Coombs test was negative. Serum immunoelectrophoresis disclosed that IgG and IgA were within normal limits; there was a mild, diffuse increase in IgM. Agarose-gel electrophoresis showed a normal pattern. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 100; the voltage was borderline low, and there was minimal elevation of the ST segments in Leads 1, 2 aVL and V\n2\nthrough V\n5\n.\nOn the ninth hospital day the pericardial friction rub and splenic tenderness persisted. A repeated electrocardiogram disclosed atrial fibrillation at a ventricular rate of 130. The friction rub was loud and leathery; the heart was enlarged to the anterior axillary line. The size of the liver and spleen was unchanged. Digoxin was begun. On the 10th hospital day the patient continued to complain of abdominal pain and mild pleuritic pain; progressive dyspnea was observed. The hematocrit was 38.9 per cent. An x-ray film of the chest disclosed a slight further increase in the pleural effusions. Oxygen was begun. On the 12th hospital day the pericardial friction rub was no longer heard; mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness was present. The patient vomited, and digoxin was discontinued briefly. Another x-ray film of the chest showed a further increase in the pleural effusions. An echocardiogram demonstrated that the right ventricle was enlarged, and the interventricular septum hypertrophied; an echo-free space behind the heart was believed to represent either pericardial or pleural fluid.\nOn the 14th hospital day the hematocrit was 36.7 per cent; the white-cell count was 10,000, and the platelet count 122,000. An electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial fibrillation, with slightly more prominent ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Melena was noted again. A right-sided thoracentesis yielded 50 ml of cloudy, straw-colored fluid that contained 12,500 red cells and 8650 white cells, of which 69 per cent were neutrophils, 15 per cent lymphocytes, 11 per cent monocytes and 5 per cent mesothelial cells; the protein was 2.7 g per 100 ml, and the LDH 129 U per milliliter. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed no malignant tumor cells. On the following day an electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 105. Another x-ray film of the chest disclosed no change. On the 16th hospital day the hematocrit was 34.9 per cent. A hepatojugular reflux was present, and an S3 gallop sound was heard along the left parasternal region; the upper abdominal veins were distended and were noted to fill in retrograde fashion. On the next day atrial fibrillation was again observed. The liver became larger, and trace edema of the lower extremities developed. On the 19th hospital day prednisone, 15 mg daily, was begun. A\n99m\nTc sulfur colloid liver-spleen scan (\nFig. 2\n) disclosed an increased distance between the diaphragm and the dome of the liver and spleen consistent with either bilateral large pleural effusions or ascitic fluid; the liver appeared small; the spleen was enlarged, and increased marrow uptake was observed. Comparison of the scan with a cutaneous marker confirmed that an epigastric mass was the left hepatic lobe. An electrocardiogram showed reversion to a normal rhythm. Melena ceased.\nOn the 21st hospital day the patient felt improved, and examination revealed that the spleen was less tender. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg, the creatinine 0.7 mg, and the glucose 155 mg per 100 ml. An electrocardiogram again showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 95. On the following day the hematocrit was 37.8 per cent, and the white-cell count 12,700. Repeated stool specimens gave negative tests for occult blood. On the 27th hospital day an electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 100, with slightly more prominent ST-segment and Twave abnormalities. The dose of prednisone was increased to 30 mg daily.\nOn the 30th hospital day the patient appeared confused. Examination disclosed that the spleen was not tender, although tenderness over the liver persisted; there was ++ peripheral edema. The dose of prednisone was tapered. The glucose was 186 mg, the calcium 8.8 mg, the phosphorus 2.2 mg, the ammonia 161 \u03bcg, and the protein 5.5 g (the albumin 2.7 g, and the globulin 2.8 g) per 100 ml. On the 32d hospital day the dyspnea appeared increased, and the patient became lethargic. An electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 100. On the 34th hospital day the ammonia was 219 \u03bcg per 100 ml. On the following day the patient was somnolent. Tachypnea was prominent, and a nonproductive cough was observed. The abdomen was distended and tympanitic. The hematocrit was 35.7 per cent, and the white-cell count 13,000. Oliguria developed. On the 37th hospital day a gated cardiac scan (\nFig. 3\n) showed that the left ventricle appeared vigorous; the right ventricle was slightly dilated and possibly hypertrophied. The patient died on the 39th hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Adolf W. Karchmer\\*: Sixteen years before admission this patient was said to have sarcoidosis on the basis of a biopsy and a compatible clinical illness. Her lack of response to skin tests with histoplasmin and 1 unit of tuberculin implies anergy, but since the tuberculin antigen exposure was minimal and prior exposure to *Histoplasma capsulatum* was unknown these tests were a weak challenge to her delayed hypersensitivity mechanism. The negative histoplasmin test does suggest that the hilar lymphadenopathy was not due to *H. capsulatum*. In addition, the patient had undergone a modified right radical mastectomy for infiltrating ductal carcinoma 19 months before admission. The noncaseating granulomas and the Schaumann body seen in the axillary lymph nodes suggest continued activity of the sarcoidosis but are not diagnostic of it. Noncaseating granulomas can be seen in lymph nodes draining carcinomas, and the Schaumann body is not specific for sarcoidosis but is also seen with berylliosis and other granulomatous diseases. The final admission to the hospital followed a brief illness characterized by mild constitutional and respiratory-tract symptoms with progression to fever and right pleuritic pain. Noteworthy in the history is the denial of previous chest pain, dyspnea on exertion and peripheral edema. The examination on admission revealed no findings indicative of right or left ventricular failure, but the hepatosplenomegaly and the abdominal-wall venous pattern suggest the presence of portal hypertension.May we review the x-ray films at this time?Dr. Theresa C. McLoud: A film of the chest obtained seven months before admission shows changes consistent with sarcoidosis, probably of long duration, with enlargement of the right paratracheal, right and left hilar and prevascular lymph nodes beneath the aortic arch. Some of the nodes contain areas of calcification. There are several nodular and irregular densities in both lower lobes and in the mid-lung zones, with irregular strands suggestive of fibrosis. The heart is minimally enlarged. The films taken on admission ([Fig. 1](#f001)) demonstrate little change in the appearance of the chest. There is still evidence of lymphadenopathy and parenchymal lung disease compatible with scarring and diffuse interstitial infiltration. Both costophrenic angles are a little less sharp than on the previous examination, suggesting pleural effusions, and the heart is slightly larger than it was seven months previously. On a film from the examination 11 days later the pleural effusions are obvious, with blunting of both costophrenic angles.The 99mTc sulfur colloid liver-spleen scan ([Fig. 2](#f002)) demonstrates that the liver was small. A lead marker was placed over the palpable mass, which was thought to be the left lobe of the liver. The spleen is enlarged, and uptake of the colloid is seen in the bone marrow. The gated cardiac scan ([Fig. 3](#f003)) shows that the ventricles were not enlarged and contracted normally.Dr. Karchmer: Do you interpret the right ventricular contraction as an argument against cor pulmonale?Dr. McLoud: Yes.Dr. Karchmer: Despite the pulmonary abnormalities demonstrated on the x-ray films there is insufficient clinical or electrocardiographic evidence to make a diagnosis of cor pulmonale secondary to sarcoidosis. Therefore, the liver disease and the portal hypertension cannot be explained on the basis of cardiac cirrhosis.Early in the hospital course the presence of pericarditis was manifested by a friction rub, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Shortly thereafter gastrointestinal bleeding occurred, initially with maroon stools and later with melena. Although esophageal varices were found they were notincriminated as a source of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be caused by granulomatous involvement of the gastrointestinal mucosa or thrombocytopenia associated with hypersplenism in patients with sarcoidosis. Neither of these findings was present in this patient. Obviously, a lesion unrelated to sarcoidosis might have been the cause of the gastrointestinal bleeding.With time, the pleural effusions increased, dyspnea occurred, and pain developed in the left side of the chest and the left upper quadrant in association with tenderness of the spleen and liver. Congestion or overload of the right circulatory system was suggested by the evidence of enlargement of the right ventricular cavity on an echocardiogram, the positive hepatojugular reflux and increasing peripheral edema. The third heart sound heard at the left sternal border presumably implied a failing right ventricle. At this juncture it is important to consider pericardial disease with cardiac tamponade as a possible cause of the right-circulatory-system overload. The echocardiographic report suggesting a posterior pericardial fluid collection lends credence to this consideration. We are not told, however, of changes in the blood pressure or of the presence of a pulsus paradoxus as clinical clues to that diagnosis.Prednisone therapy resulted in transient improvement, but by the 30th hospital day the patient had increased peripheral edema, further hepatic tenderness and a rising serum ammonia concentration in the absence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Somnolence and oliguria developed. We do not know the hemodynamic state of the patient during the final days, in particular the blood pressure and the state of the right circulatory system. The gated cardiac scan performed shortly before death implied good myocardial function, arguing against primary myocardial disease as the cause of the oliguria. Without hemodynamic data, however, we cannot exclude cardiac tamponade with a diminished cardiac output as a cause of the oliguria, nor can we ascribe the latter to the hepatorenal syndrome.At this point I must address myself to the question that confronted the physicians taking care of this patient as they struggled with the day-to-day events. Could extensive systemic sarcoidosis account for this entire illness?Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown cause characterized by noncaseating epithelioid granulomas involving many organs. In a review of 1254 biopsy-confirmed cases from 10 medical centers Mayock and Bertrand[1](#core-r001) pointed out that x-ray films of the chest were abnormal in 94 per cent of the cases. Pulmonary parenchymal disease was found in 53 per cent of the patients, only half of whom had respiratory-tract symptoms. Hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy was noted in 71 per cent of the cases, and both lymphadenopathy and pulmonary parenchymal disease were present in 51 per cent. Pleural effusion was reported in only 1.5 per cent of the cases and when present was considered suggestive of either heart failure or a coincidental disease. Peripheral lymph nodes were involved clinically or pathologically in 73 per cent of the cases, although not always strikingly so, the skin was affected in 32 per cent, and the eye, particularly the uveal tract, in 21 per cent. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were found in 21 and 18 per cent, respectively, but clinically important liver disease and portal hypertension were infrequent. There was cardiac involvement exclusive of cor pulmonale in 5 per cent of the cases, but pericarditis was not described. Thus, in this extensive review of well documented cases Mayock and Bertrand did not describe or noted as very rare three of the major clinical features of this patient's illness \u2014 pleural effusion, pericarditis and hepatosplenomegaly with portal hypertension.Could another disease have existed for 16 years masquerading as sarcoidosis? Chronic berylliosis can certainly do so. Sprince, Kazemi and Hardy,[2](#core-r002) in a review of cases in the Beryllium Case Registry, found rare examples of isolated bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, parotitis, Central-nervous-system granulomas and restrictive myocardial disease in patients with chronic berylliosis but stated that uveitis, the uveoparotid-fever syndrome, cranial-nerve and peripheral-nerve involvement and cystic bone lesions have not been seen in association with berylliosis. In this case the lack of an occupational exposure to beryllium and, in particular, the clinical evidence of pericarditis allow me to reject the diagnosis of chronic berylliosis.The pleural effusions, pericarditis and portal hypertension, although uncommon, are compatible with sarcoidosis. Recent reviews suggest that pleural disease occurs in between 2 and 12 per cent of the patients with this disease.[3,4](#core-r003) Twenty of 37 patients with biopsy-proved pleural sarcoidosis had unilateral or bilateral pleural effusions. The pleural fluid was described in 16 cases and was an exudate in 10 of them. When cells were noted 61 to 100 per cent of them were lymphocytes. Almost all the patients with pleural sarcoidosis had extensive pulmonary disease, the pleural effusions were often discovered coincidentally, and the patients did not usually present with pleurisy. Although pleural involvement by sarcoidosis may be more common than previously thought, there are no features characteristic of that entity, and the diagnosis must be established by biopsy with the exclusion of other disorders.Cardiac involvement in patients with sarcoidosis is well known. Granulomas can infiltrate the heart, and fibrous scars are seen in the absence of coronary-artery disease. The granulomas are found most often in the free wall of the left ventricle, especially the papillary muscle and adjacent myocardium, and the interventricular septum. In a study of 89 patients with sarcoidosis causing cardiac dysfunction Roberts et al.[5](#core-r005) observed the following abnormalities: arrhythmias, principally ventricular but also atrial; conduction disturbances; congestive heart failure; papillary-muscle dysfunction; electrocardiographic changes consistent with myocardial infarction in the absence of coronary-artery disease; ventricular aneurysm; and, lastly, recurrent pericardial effusions. In addition, ventricular mural thrombi have been found and on occasion have given rise to emboli. Granulomatous involvement of the epicardium and parietal pericardium, although among the least common cardiac manifestations of sarcoidosis, has resulted in an illness characterized by chest pain, pericardial effusion, atrial arrhythmias, low voltage on the electrocardiogram and cardiac tamponade.Infiltration of the liver by sarcoid granulomas is common and is usually manifested as minor abnormalities of liver function without appreciable hepatocellular insufficiency or portal hypertension. Rarely, the clinical picture is dominated by hepatocellular insufficiency with little portal hypertension or, conversely, by marked portal hypertension with limited hepatocellular dysfunction.[6](#core-r006)The assessment of new symptoms and signs in a patient with a chronic illness such as sarcoidosis requires consideration of possible coexisting diseases. Although this patient's chronic portal hypertension and varices could have been due to an independent disease there are no clues to such a process, and I am willing to accept them as unusual manifestations of sarcoidosis. In contrast, because both pleural involvement and pericardial disease are unusual manifestations of sarcoidosis and in this patient were acute processes superimposed on a previously stable disorder, they must be scrutinized closely to rule out a second disease. The differential diagnosis of pleuritis and pericarditis is extensive, but in this case two types of disease merit special consideration \u2014 malignant tumors and infection.Carcinoma of the breast frequently involves the pleura, with the production of an effusion. In terms of absolute numbers, it is the most common form of metastasis involving the heart. In this case the failure to find evidence of metastatic breast cancer on cytologic examination of the pleural fluid and on bone scan plus the favorable features in the mastectomy specimen make metastatic breast carcinoma an unlikely cause of the pleural and pericardial disease. In view of the initial respiratory-tract symptoms infectious agents must also be considered as possible causes of the pleuritis and pericarditis. These include selected bacteria and viruses, *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, fungi and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Hematogenous seeding of bacteria such as meningococci or *Haemophilus influenzae* from a primary infection in the respiratory tract can result in empyema and purulent pericarditis. These complications may also be caused by direct extension of other bacteria from a contiguous focus of infection above or below the diaphragm. The case record does not suggest a primary bacterial infection, however. Furthermore, despite the predominance of neutrophils in the pleural fluid, the clinical course \u2014 notably, the spontaneous subsidence of fever and the nontoxic one-month illness \u2014 argues against the diagnosis of empyema and purulent pericarditis. Atypical pneumonia due to *M. pneumoniae* has been associated with a transient exudative pleural effusion in 20 per cent of the cases.[7](#core-r007) *M. pneumoniae* has also been implicated as a cause of acute pericarditis, which may be accompanied by myocarditis, of varying severity.[8](#core-r008) Of interest are the observations that pneumonia may be absent in cases of this type, and a considerable number of the patients have been 50 to 75 years of age, older than those whom we usually consider as hosts for this pathogen. The absence of pneumonia and the chronicity of this patient's pleural effusions, however, lead me away from this diagnosis. Another consideration is viral pleuropericarditis. In this setting the most likely pathogen is the Coxsackie B virus. Sainani et al.[9](#core-r009) described 22 adults with heart disease due to Coxsackie B virus infection, and 12 of them had pleural effusions. The clinical features of that infection were similar to the findings in this case, particularly if one accepts the premise that the infection was superimposed on chronic sarcoidosis. The diagnosis of a viral pleuropericarditis would be consistent with the process in this case in terms of both the clinical and the laboratory findings. Nevertheless, the available data are insufficient to make that diagnosis with certainty.Calcification of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, as shown on the x-ray films of the chest in this case, has been reported in 6 to 8 per cent of patients with sarcoidosis.[10](#core-r010) Some of the calcifications, however, could have been in healed areas of infection by mycobacteria or fungi. Such lesions may be foci for late reactivation of infection. Tuberculous pericarditis may arise by direct extension from the lung or by hematogenous dissemination. In adults it develops more commonly as an extension of infection from adjacent lymph nodes. Only 35 per cent of the patients with tuberculous pericarditis have active pulmonary disease. Although the onset of tuberculous pericarditis is often insidious, and pericardial fluid reaccumulates rapidly after pericardiocentesis, the clinical features of acute tuberculous pericarditis per se are not distinctive. They include a cough, fever, dyspnea, chest pain and ankle swelling. In time hemodynamic embarrassment may lead to symptoms and signs of venous congestion and decreased cardiac output. Study of the pericardial fluid and the pericardium may be required to establish this diagnosis. In cases of tuberculous pericarditis the pericardial fluid is an exudate and contains from 200 to 2,000,000 red cells and from 600 to 54,000 white cells per cubic millimeter. The average white-cell differential count is 27 per cent neutrophils and 73 per cent mononuclear cells, although on occasion neutrophils predominate.[11](#core-r011) Histologic and bacteriologic study of the pericardial fluid and the tissue will give a definitive diagnosis in most of the cases. Isolation of *M. tuberculosis* from clinical specimens, however, requires six to eight weeks. When tuberculous pericarditis is suspected in the absence of definitive Ziehl-Neelsen smears one must make a tentative diagnosis and initiate treatment. A history of tuberculosis or the presence of active tuberculosis in other organs supports such a diagnosis.Rooney and his associates[12](#core-r012) found pleural effusions in 25 of 35 patients with tuberculous pericarditis. Nine of the effusions were due to active tuberculosis. Tuberculous pleuritis results in an exudate with a protein concentration in excess of 2.5 g per 100 ml and an elevated LDH concentration. The glucose level is variable and not a helpful marker. The white-cell count in the pleural fluid ranges from 1000 to 6000. Although two thirds of the patients have approximately 95 per cent lymphocytes in the pleural fluid, about 10 per cent have a predominance of neutrophils, which is more common early in the course of the disease. The definitive diagnosis of a tuberculous pleural effusion is greatly enhanced by the bacteriologic and histologic study of a pleural-biopsy specimen in contrast to examination of the pleural fluid alone.[13,14](#core-r013)*H. capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatiditis* and *Coccidioides immitis* infect human beings in a manner similar to that of *M. tuberculosis*. They enter via the lungs, disseminate to regional lymph nodes via the lymphatics and may spread to other organs via the bloodstream. These fungal infections are usually contained as the immune system is activated, but viable organisms may persist, serving as a source of late reactivation of infection, either spontaneously or in the setting of depressed host defenses. Of these fungi, *H. capsulatum* is the most likely to produce exuberant calcifications like those seen on the x-ray films in this case. Although histoplasmosis could be reactivated, with local extension of the infection to the pleural and pericardial surfaces, such an occurrence would be very unusual. Stainable histoplasma organisms found in calcified granulomatous lesions are generally not viable. Winterbauer and Kraemer[15](#core-r015) concluded that the aspergillus species are the fungi that infect patients with sarcoidosis most often. This complication usually occurs as a mycetoma in a pulmonary cyst, but occasionally invasive aspergillosis is encountered. The x-ray films in this case do not suggest a mycetoma or invasive aspergillosis.This patient clearly had long-standing systemic sarcoidosis, with extensive pulmonary disease, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and portal hypertension with esophageal varices. I realize that many a discusser at these exercises has perished on the edge of Ockham's razor, and that there is a dictum calling for at least two diagnoses in patients more than 50 years of age. Nevertheless, I suspect that the bilateral pleural effusions and pericarditis in this case were manifestations of the sarcoidosis. Both are infrequent findings in association with sarcoidosis, and the pleural fluid with its predominance of neutrophils is atypical. The splenic tenderness may have resulted from embolic infarction secondary to a left ventricular or left atrial mural thrombus or perhaps from perisplenitis related to sarcoid granulomas in the splenic capsule. The late clinical course was marked by overload of the right circulatory system, which may have been a consequence of pericardial disease compromising hemodynamic function.Although the bilaterality of this patient's pleural disease has deterred me from the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy and pericarditis, I am uncomfortable in that stand. The assessment of the serosal inflammation might have been aided by additional tuberculin skin tests and a pleural biopsy. Anergy is often considered a feature of sarcoidosis, but patients with this disease and coincidental active tuberculosis usually react to the tuberculin skin test.[16](#core-r016) A positive skin test in this patient would have induced vigorous efforts to rule out the diagnosis of tuberculosis and would have moved me to initiate antituberculous chemotherapy.Dr. David J. Kanarek: One interesting feature in the case record that supports your disinclination to diagnose tuberculosis is the finding of 5 per cent mesothelial cells in the pleural fluid, which would be very unusual with tuberculosis.Dr. Walter T. ST. Goar: Our thinking as we took care of this patient was not very different from Dr. Karchmer's. The important features in the background of her recent illness were the long standing, moderately advanced but clinically stable sarcoidosis with associated hypersplenism, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The size of the spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes and the low white-cell and platelet levels had not changed during the 10 years I had known her. A bone-marrow examination done by Dr. Leonard Ellman revealed that it was normoblastic, suggesting that the low white-cell count and low platelet level were due to hypersplenism rather than marrow failure. Whenever I considered using prednisone to diminish the manifestations of the sarcoidosis I was dissuaded by the patient's general state of well-being. The hematologic abnormalities, however, may have lowered her resistance to infection and also probably contributed to the acute and moderately severe gastrointestinal bleeding.The infection that precipitated the recent admission was not well defined, presenting as a relatively mild viral respiratory-tract infection with an associated pleurisy later complicated by a severe pericarditis. We were never able to isolate the offending organism. We worried about an exacerbation of the sarcoidosis, but neither the infection nor the gastrointestinal bleeding was satisfactorily explained on that basis. Also, there was no solid evidence of extension of the sarcoidosis.The episode of gastrointestinal bleeding, with the hematocrit dropping from 36 to 24 per cent in a couple of days, was associated with dramatic enlargement of the periumbilical vessels \u2014 a typical caput medusae. Marked and probably acute enlargement of esophageal varices was observed by Dr. Bernard R. Aserkoff on endoscopic examination, but he found no bleeding source down to the ligament of Treitz. At the same time striking tenderness of the spleen developed. We believed that she had had a thrombosis in the portal venous system leading to esophageal and periumbilical varices, and that the gastrointestinal bleeding may have originated in mesenteric varices below the ligament of Treitz. The splenic tenderness raised the question of infarction. We deferred an angiographic examination, thinking that it would be more useful therapeutically in the event of another acute episode of bleeding. The pericarditis, diagnosed by Dr. Hyslop, became progressively severe and together with the atrial fibrillation seemed to account for the heart failure. Her cardiac status had previously been good. The cancer of the breast removed 19 months earlier appeared to be unrelated to the recent illness.We were little more than frustrated spectators as we observed this patient's downhill course. She was given a short trial of corticosteroids in view of the underlying sarcoidosis and the thrombocytopenia, but a week of that therapy was enough to convince us that it would not be helpful. The long years of sarcoidosis appear to have set the stage for an overwhelming viral infection and portal venous thrombosis.Dr. Newton E. Hyslop, Jr.: We were concerned, as was Dr. Karchmer, about possible infectious causes of the granulomatous disease, particularly in view of the low frequency of calcification in association with sarcoidosis.[17](#core-r017) The onset of the pulmonary process, which dated back to 16 years before admission, had been abrupt and occurred while she was living in Massachusetts. Her symptoms then were lethargy and a nonproductive persistent cough, and she thought that she had contracted influenza. Her symptoms continued for three months and led to evaluation in Norfolk, Virginia, where she had taken up residence one month earlier. X-ray films of the chest demonstrated hilar lymphadenopathy, and biopsy of a supraclavicular lymph node showed a noncaseating granuloma. Since first-strength (1 TU) tuberculin and histoplasmin skin tests were negative a diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. A Kveim test was not done. She did not receive steroids at that time, but the acute symptoms eventually subsided, leaving her with a limited exercise tolerance. In the intervening years the hilar lymph nodes became calcified, but the pulmonary disease otherwise seemed stable. The white-cell count gradually fell, however, reaching 1500 on the previous admission and suggesting that hypersplenism had been present for a fairly long time.In view of these facts and the presence of granulomas in the axillary lymph nodes we concluded that an active chronic granulomatous process was present and that her residential history at the time of its onset virtually ruled out a disseminated mycosis. We also thought that active disseminated tuberculosis of this extent and duration was unlikely in the absence of constitutional symptoms. Therefore, lacking evidence for any known causative agent, we accepted the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.The other issue was the cause of the acute pleuritis and pericarditis. She described her illness as beginning with a one-day prodrome of nasal congestion, followed by chills and fever and then in a few days by pleurisy. On admission several days later she did not appear seriously ill; her main complaints were fatigue and pleurisy, and the only new physical findings were a low-grade fever and pleuropericarditis. Initially, it seemed probable that she would recover from what appeared to be a superimposed viral infection. The deterioration of her condition began with the onset of atrial fibrillation, severe right-sided heart failure and probable portal-vein and splenic-vein thrombosis. A search for the cause of the cardiac failure did not disclose a treatable disorder. The echocardiogram showed only a small effusion, and constriction and tamponade were thought to be excluded by the vigor of the left ventricular contractions demonstrated on the gated cardiac scan. The cardiac failure was therefore attributed to decompensation of an underlying cor pulmonale by atrial fibrillation. The fibrillation was thought to have been precipitated by viral pericarditis and myocarditis or sarcoid myocarditis.[5](#core-r005)Dr. Barry W. Levine: We see patients with long standing sarcoidosis that is considered inactive, but they nevertheless eventually die of the disease. We reported such a case; the patient had had sarcoidosis for 25 years, but then an exacerbation with the onset of pulmonary hypertension proved fatal.[18](#core-r018) In the case under discussion we thought that a unifying concept would be implication of sarcoidosis in the hepatic and splenic disease as well as in the pulmonary parenchyma and vasculature. We believed that she had a rapid exacerbation of the sarcoidosis with the onset of pulmonary hypertension, and that there was considerable hepatic and splenic involvement by sarcoidosis, causing hemodynamic alterations in the portal blood flow and precipitating a portal-vein thrombosis and portal hypertension. For this reason we thought that vigorous therapy with steroids was indicated to control a reactivation of the disease.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Karl H. Proppe: Examination of the axillary lymph nodes in the radical-mastectomy specimen disclosed many noncaseating granulomas, which appeared to be of long duration, with collagenization and only a few multinucleated giant cells, some of which contained asteroid bodies. One Schaumann body was also observed. Granulomas of this nature are typically seen in patients with sarcoidosis but are not diagnostic, and bacterial and fungal diseases must be ruled out. In this case special stains did not reveal any organisms, and the clinical and pathological findings were considered characteristic of sarcoidosis.At autopsy there was no evidence of carcinoma or gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The major changes were found in the heart, lungs, liver, spleen and lymph nodes. The pericardial cavity was markedly distended by 700 ml of turbid fluid. The pericardial surfaces were coated with fibrin, and microscopical examination showed a predominantly mononuclear infiltration with early organization ([Fig. 4](#f004)). There was no evidence of sarcoidosis. No viral inclusion bodies were encountered, and viral cultures were negative. Bacterial cultures yielded a few organisms, including moderate diphtheroids, a few enterococci, a few klebsiella and anaerobic gram-positive cocci, but these bacteria undoubtedly were post-mortem contaminants. Microscopical examination of the myocardium disclosed no evidence of sarcoidosis or myocarditis. There were bilateral serosanguineous pleural effusions, with a total of 1350 ml of fluid. A few fibrous adhesions were observed, but we found no acute inflammation or granulomas on microscopical examination. There was marked pulmonary fibrosis, which was most pronounced in the hilar areas, extending peripherally along the bronchi; scars were also present away from the bronchi ([Fig. 5](#f005)). Microscopical examination disclosed hypocellular connective tissue with a predilection for a peribronchial location. More peripherally, focal fibrosis involved alveolar walls. Only in the periphery were collagenized granulomas found ([Fig. 6](#f006)). No involvement of vessels or recent active sarcoid granulomas were seen.The liver weighed only 700 g and was firm and fibrous. Microscopical examination failed to reveal unequivocal evidence of sarcoidosis but showed macronodular cirrhosis ([Fig. 7](#f007)). In one area there was a small, round focus of hyalinized collagen that may have been a granuloma at one time. The spleen was almost twice the normal size, weighing 550 g. The presence of recent massive thrombosis of the portal, superior mesenteric and splenic veins ([Fig. 8](#f008)) may have contributed to its enlargement. The sections of the spleen disclosed diffuse congestion and fibrosis but no areas that could be interpreted as either active or healed sarcoidosis. The mediastinal, periaortic and peribronchial lymph nodes were the sites of granulomas largely replaced by collagen and together with the lungs were the only areas involved by sarcoidosis. The bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes were calcified and fibrous, but with no evidence of fungal infection.The nature of the hepatic cirrhosis is not clear. It is well established that hepatic involvement is common in patients with sarcoidosis,[19](#core-r019) although the majority of them have no associated symptoms. A few, however, have considerable liver disease. Maddrey and his colleagues[6](#core-r006) evaluated 300 patients with sarcoidosis and found 20 with histologically confirmed granulomas in the liver. Nine of the 20 patients also had cirrhosis. In some of them the fibrosis was associated with the granulomas, but three had a predominance of fibrosis and nonspecific inflammation that could not be explained by the presence of granulomas. Five patients had hepatocellular damage and inflammatory changes in excess of what could be attributed directly to sarcoidosis. In two cases the cirrhosis was of the postnecrotic type. The relation of sarcoidosis to cirrhosis is difficult to determine in this case in the absence of histologic confirmation of sarcoidosis involving the liver. Although it is conceivable that the cirrhosis was due to sarcoidosis that healed, the cause of the cirrhosis remains obscure.The patient's many symptoms and clinical course cannot be explained by any one pathologic process. It appears, however, that the terminal chain of events is explained in large part by the pericarditis, and I agree with Dr. Karchmer that viral infection should be considered and is not ruled out by the absence of histologic evidence or by the negative cultures. In addition, the material obtained for culture was small and not well preserved, and the negative viral cultures may have been due to technical problems.In attempting to explain the patient's terminal course I am assuming that the pericarditis, which may have been due to a viral infection, caused cardiac arrhythmias that led to right circulatory overload. This situation was further aggravated by the marked pericardial effusion, which may have resulted in cardiac tamponade. The intestinal and abdominal symptoms were largely due to portal hypertension and spontaneous thrombosis of the portal, superior mesenteric and splenic veins.\n",

      "question": "A newborn girl was admitted to the hospital because of respiratory distress, muscular hypotonia, and cutaneous vesicles.\nThe child was born at full term by a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery and was the second child of a 29-year-old mother. The pregnancy was complicated by hyperemesis during the first trimester, which required hospital admission for rehydration; at four months of pregnancy a herpetic lesion on the mother's buttock yielded herpes simplex virus, Type II, on culture; no genital lesions were detected. Delivery occurred 1 1/2 hours after artificial rupture of membranes. The birth weight was 3.94 kg. At birth the child was noted to be hypotonic, with grunting, flaring of the alae nasi, and intercostal retractions. Apgar scores of 5 at one minute and 7 at five minutes were assigned. The girl was also noted to have five or six firm, raised yellow vesicular lesions on the distal portions of the arms and legs, and similar lesions were reportedly observed on the placenta. Intermittent positive-pressure ventilation was begun. On arrival in the newborn nursery a specimen of capillary blood showed that the glucose was 3 mmol per liter (60 mg per 100 ml); the partial pressure of oxygen (PO\n2\n) was 58 mm Hg. The hematocrit was 43.3 percent; the white-cell count was 11,800, with 45 percent neutrophils, 3 percent band forms, 50 percent lymphocytes, and 2 percent monocytes; the platelet count was 253,000. An infusion of glucose in water was begun by vein, and the child was placed in a hood with a 35 percent oxygen atmosphere; on subsequent determinations the oxygen saturation ranged between 95 percent and 100 percent. Specimens of blood were obtained for culture, and single doses of ampicillin and gentamicin were given by vein. Transport to this hospital was arranged.\nOn arriving at the referring hospital the transport team found a vigorous, pink child in an oxygenated hood; she was afebrile, with a heart rate of 160, respirations of 40 per minute, and a blood pressure of 70/35 mm Hg. A minimal decrease in tone was observed, and no evidence of respiratory distress was detected. A specimen of arterial blood, obtained while the girl was breathing 35 percent oxygen, revealed that the PO\n2\nwas 113 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO\n2\n) 45 mm Hg, and the pH 7.33. An x-ray film of the chest (\nFig. 1\n) disclosed abnormal linear and granular opacities in both lungs, consistent with retained fetal lung fluid or neonatal pneumonia; the heart and thymus gland appeared normal. The patient was brought to this hospital by ambulance without incident while breathing 50 percent oxygen.\nThere was a history of hyperemesis gravidarum during the mother's first pregnancy; she had varicella in childhood, and her six-year-old daughter contracted varicella during the fifth month of the pregnancy just completed. The mother's blood group was O-Rh positive; serologic tests for syphilis and toxoplasmosis on a specimen of maternal blood were reported to be negative, and a test for antibodies to rubella was reported to be positive. The child's father was 34 years of age and well. A maternal uncle had retinitis pigmentosa, and carcinoma was present in maternal antecedents; the paternal grandfather had adult-onset diabetes mellitus. The family had no pets.\nThe temperature was 37\u00b0C, the pulse was 150, and the respirations were 50. The blood pressure was 70/35 mm Hg.\nOn examination the child appeared well, without jaundice. Several yellow, raised vesicles on erythematous bases, 3 to 6 mm, were observed on the extensor surfaces of both forearms, with larger lesions on the anterior surfaces of the lower legs; the lesions were solitary, not grouped; some of the lesions appeared to be healing; no Nikolsky sign was detected. The anterior fontanelle was soft. The ears, facies, and oropharynx appeared normal. The neck was supple; no lymphadenopathy was found. A few inspiratory crackles were present over both lung fields; there was no evidence of respiratory distress. The heart was normal. Abdominal examination showed that the edge of the liver descended 2 cm below the right costal margin; the spleen was not felt. The external genitalia appeared normal. The femoral pulses were full and equal; no peripheral edema, clubbing, or cyanosis was seen. On neurologic examination the tendon reflexes were ++ and equal; a slight decrease in tone was evident; Moro and sucking reflexes were present; no evidence of seizure activity was detected.\nThe hematocrit was 45.5 percent; the white-cell count was 12,900, with 83 percent neutrophils, 12 percent lymphocytes, and 5 percent monocytes on an automated differential count that is insensitive to eosinophils; the platelet count was 274,000. The urea nitrogen was 3 mmol per liter (9 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 3.1 mmol per liter (55 mg per 100 ml), and the calcium 2.1 mmol per liter (8.4 mg per 100 ml). The sodium was 136 mmol, the potassium 6.0 mmol, the chloride 106 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 26 mmol per liter. A lumbar puncture yielded clear cerebrospinal fluid that contained 610 red cells and 10 white cells per cubic millimeter; the glucose was 53 mg, and the protein 133 mg per 100 ml; microscopical examination of a stained specimen of the fluid revealed very rare neutrophils, without microorganisms. In a specimen of capillary blood, obtained while the child was breathing 35 percent oxygen, the PO\n2\nwas 52 mm Hg, the PCO\n2\n50 mm Hg, and the pH 7.33. An electrocardiogram disclosed a sinus rhythm at a rate of 170, with an R axis of +110\u00b0, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities in Leads 2, 3, and aVF. A Tzanck preparation of vesicle content showed no multinucleated giant cells. A potassium hydroxide preparation for fungal hyphae was negative. Microscopical examination of a Gram-stained specimen of a vesicle revealed numerous neutrophils with questionable intracellular gram-positive microorganisms or granules.\nSpecimens of blood, a vesicle, and the cerebrospinal fluid were obtained for culture. Ampicillin and gentamicin were continued, and oxacillin and acyclovir were begun by vein. Intermittent intercostal retractions were noted and gradually decreased. The axillary temperature did not exceed 37.4\u00b0C.\nOn the second hospital day the child appeared comfortable. No new cutaneous lesions were observed, and those present on entry appeared to be resolving. Sparse crackles were heard over both lungs, without evidence of respiratory embarrassment. The child was active, with good tone and a healthy cry. The axillary temperature ranged from 37.2\u00b0 to 36.3\u00b0C. The urea nitrogen was 2 mmol per liter (7 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 4.9 mmol per liter (88 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 2.3 mmol per liter (9.1 mg per 100 ml), the conjugated bilirubin less than 9 \u03bcmol per liter (less than 0.5 mg per 100 ml), the total bilirubin 65 \u03bcmol per liter (3.8 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 5.2 g (the albumin 4.1 g and the globulin 1.1 g) per 100 ml. The sodium was 140 mmol, the potassium 4.3 mmol, the chloride 109 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 27 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) was 40 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 79 U per liter. In a specimen of capillary blood, obtained while the child was breathing room air, the PO\n2\nwas 60 mm Hg, the PCO\n2\n42 mm Hg, and the pH 7.40. An x-ray film of the chest (\nFig. 2\n) showed almost complete clearing of the linear and granular pulmonary opacities; the heart and mediastinum remained normal. On the third hospital day the girl appeared well and passed stools that gave negative tests for occult blood. Physical examination showed no change except that conjunctival injection was observed in the left eye, with mild swelling of the lids; erythromycin ophthalmic ointment was applied. The axillary temperature did not exceed 37\u00b0C. On the following day the axillary temperature was no higher than 36.9\u00b0C. Physical examination disclosed a diffuse, erythematous papular rash in a linear pattern that was confluent in areas and was most prominent on the extremities but affected the trunk to a lesser extent; questionable vesicles were observed. A bacteriologic culture of a vesicle obtained on admission yielded no microorganisms; a viral culture was pending. Gentamicin, ampicillin, and oxacillin were discontinued; acyclovir was continued. An immunofluorescent antibody test on a specimen of nasal washings was negative for respiratory syncytial virus. Specimens of sputum and additional nasal washings were obtained for viral cultures.\nOn the fifth hospital day the axillary temperature was 36.9\u00b0C. The rash was questionably improved. Reports of serologic tests were received (\nTable 1\n).\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Karen F. Rothman\\*: May we review the x-ray films?Dr. Robert H. Cleveland: A posteroanterior radiograph of the chest obtained on the day of birth ([Fig. 1](#f001)) reveals multiple linear and slightly confluent areas of opacification throughout both lungs. The lateral view substantiates the diffuse distribution of the abnormality. A follow-up frontal radiograph taken on the second day of life ([Fig. 2](#f002)) shows only minimal persistence of the linear lesions, with a striking clearing of the previous findings.Dr. Rothman: The differential diagnosis of vesiculopustular eruptions in the newborn is large. The most important decision that the clinician must make when faced with an infant with blisters is whether the disease is infectious or noninfectious. The results of a few simple and inexpensive tests ([Table 2](#t002)) usually disclose the cause of the eruption. With the exception of a skin biopsy these tests can be performed easily within a few minutes by using materials available at every hospital. A skin biopsy for every infant with vesicles is not necessary, and therapy should not be withheld while one is waiting for this procedure. Until we are certain of the diagnosis we are obligated to treat for assumed infection, since an infant with untreated sepsis may succumb to the disease before culture results are known.The doctors caring for this patient initially were faced with a hypotonic infant in respiratory distress and prudently made a presumptive diagnosis of sepsis. Although it would have been optimal to obtain urine and cerebrospinal fluid samples before the initiation of antibiotics, a sample of blood was submitted for culture and the baby was treated for the most common forms of newborn sepsis \u2014 i.e., those due to Group B streptococcus, *Listeria monocytogenes*, andgram-negative organisms. Although none of these bacteria have been reported as a cause of vesicles at birth, Group B streptococcus may rarely cause erosions and crusts,[1,2](#core-r001) and it can be assumed that the erosions in the reported cases were at one time blisters.[3](#core-r003) Furthermore, the principle of Ockham's razor does not always apply in medicine, and it is possible that the baby had bacterial sepsis and had vesicles of another cause. Ignoring the morphologic pattern of the lesions for the moment and looking retrospectively, I shall say that sepsis caused by one of the bacteria mentioned is unlikely because the baby was vigorous and the x-ray film of the chest was normal after only one dose of antibiotics. Cultures ultimately proved that the baby did not have bacterial sepsis.On the arrival of the transport team more attention was focused on the possible infectious causes of vesicles. I shall now go through the differential diagnosis of infectious vesicular and vesiculopustular eruptions in the newborn.Infection with herpes simplex can be devastating in the newborn infant. Most infants with herpes simplex infection acquire it during passage through an infected birth canal. The infection usually occurs in infants whose mothers are experiencing their first episode of herpes simplex infection, since it is the primary infection that is most frequently associated with cervical involvement.[4](#core-r004) The incubation period for herpes simplex infection is 4 to 21 days,[5](#core-r005) and neonates who acquire it during a vaginal delivery generally have symptoms 6 days to 3 weeks after birth. Seventy-two percent of neonates with herpes simplex infection have skin lesions.[6](#core-r006) Vesicles on an erythematous base, 1 to 3 mm, arranged singly or in clusters, are usually seen,[7](#core-r007) but erosions,[8\u201310](#core-r008) bullae, macular exanthems,[11](#core-r011) purpura,[7](#core-r007) and zosteriform eruptions[7,12](#core-r007) have also been reported.Since this newborn had lesions at the time of birth and since delivery occurred less than four hours after the membranes had ruptured, intrauterine infection would have to be assumed if the child had herpes. Intrauterine acquisition of herpes simplex infection is uncommon.[13\u201320](#core-r013) The route of infection in these cases is unclear. Ascending infection is unlikely to occur through intact membranes. In the presence of maternal viremia transplacental infection can result. If this infant became infected when the mother had herpetic lesions during the fourth month of pregnancy, spontaneous abortion[21,22](#core-r021) or congenital malformations[5,22\u201325](#core-r005) might have occurred. The infant could also have become infected during an asymptomatic reinfection later in the pregnancy, but usually neonatal herpes infection occurs in the setting of a primary maternal herpetic infection.[26](#core-r026) Infants with herpes simplex infection acquired in utero are usually very ill, but some have cutaneous disease alone and others have cutaneous disease followed by involvement of other organs.The Tzank preparation obtained before the initiation of acyclovir showed no multinucleated giant cells. The usefulness of the Tzank preparation in the evaluation of a patient with vesicles has withstood the test of time.[27](#core-r027) After cleansing of the skin with alcohol or another antiseptic substance the blister is unroofed with a No. 15 Bard\u2013Parker blade.[28](#core-r028) The base of the vesicle is scraped with the blade, and the contents are spread evenly on a glass slide. The preparation is then stained with Wright's or Giemsa stain. The presence of multinucleated giant cells is diagnostic of a herpetic infection. This procedure is positive in 68 percent of patients in whom herpes simplex can be cultured.[27](#core-r027) Multinucleated giant cells are also seen in Varicella Zoster infection. The Tzank procedure takes less than 10 minutes to perform and is of major importance to the clinician. Rapid immunofluorescence tests performed on vesicular fluid may eventually replace or supplement the Tzank smear, but such techniques are not yet perfected or widely available. Confirmation of the diagnosis of herpes simplex infection can be obtained by positive culture results, with herpes simplex usually growing within 48 hours. A special transport medium is necessary for obtaining herpes cultures.I do not believe that this child had a herpes simplex infection. First of all, she looked well even before the initiation of acyclovir, whereas most infants with herpes simplex infection acquired in utero are systemically ill. She did not have an elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein level or pleocytosis, as might be expected with intrauterine herpes infection.[29](#core-r029) Although cutaneous infection may become disseminated even in infants on acyclovir therapy, it is extremely unlikely that this patient's condition would remain stable for three days, with the development of diffuse cutaneous herpes on the fourth day of acyclovir treatment but without any other evidence of clinical deterioration. The Tzank preparation was negative. Lastly, the titers of the mother and the baby were more consistent with passive transfer of maternal antibody than active disease in the infant, although infants with herpes may fail to mount a good antibody response early in their illness.[30](#core-r030)I shall move next to a consideration of congenital varicella. We are told that the mother was exposed to varicella during the fifth month of gestation. If the mother's history of having had varicella in childhood was accurate, she could not have acquired varicella a second time during pregnancy. Furthermore, varicella is nearly always symptomatic, particularly in an adult, in whom widespread cutaneous lesions and pneumonia may develop. Varicella may be especially virulent during pregnancy.[31](#core-r031) Since there is no history of symptoms in the mother, it is exceedingly unlikely that this infant acquired varicella transplacentally. Even in the improbable event that the mother did have asymptomatic varicella and transmitted it to the fetus, the infant should have had only scars four months later, at the time of delivery.[32,33](#core-r032)Varicella\u2013zoster infection has occasionally been reported in infancy.[34,35](#core-r034) Like zoster in adults and in older children, it is dermatomal from the outset and may then disseminate. In varicella\u2013zoster infections there are grouped vesicles on an erythematous base that form a segmental or dermatomal pattern. In this infant nonlinear, nongrouped lesions on the extremities were present at birth; linear vesicles developed on the fourth day. The lesions were neither segmental nor dermatomal and thus did not fit clinically with a varicella\u2013zoster infection. Furthermore, the development of disseminated varicella zoster after four days of apparent containment of infection with acyclovir would not be expected.Congenital cutaneous candidiasis is a rare but well-described disease.[36\u201338](#core-r036) The skin lesions usually begin as erythematous macules and over a few days pass through papular, vesicular, and pustular stages. This sequence is followed by superficial desquamation. Yellow vesicles similar to those in the child under discussion have been reported.[37](#core-r037) Most neonates have cutaneous disease only, but sepsis may occur, particularly in premature infants[38](#core-r038) and in those with immune deficiencies.[39](#core-r039) Similar yellow lesions have also been noted on the placenta.[39](#core-r039) When the diagnosis of candidiasis is entertained scales can be scraped onto a glass slide with the use of a No. 15 Bard\u2013Parker blade. If only blisters are present, a blister is punctured with the blade. The blister contents and roof are smeared evenly onto a glass slide. A drop or two of potassium hydroxide is added. The preparation is heated for 10 to 15 seconds. The slide is then examined for the presence of budding yeasts and pseudohyphae. Alternatively, candida can often be seen on a Gram-stained slide. Although this infant did have yellow vesicles, I do not think that she had cutaneous candidiasis. Her lesions did not progress through the stages described in that disease, and there was no desquamation. The potassium hydroxide preparation was negative. Lastly, linear vesicles are not characteristic of this disease. The only mechanism by which linear lesions can occur with candida infections is through scratching and autoinoculation, and it is improbable that this infant would have acquired multiple linear lesions in that way.A Gram stain performed on the blister fluid was reported to show numerous neutrophils with questionable intracellular gram-positive microorganisms or granules. Probably largely on the basis of this result the physicians decided to add the intravenous administration of oxacillin to the patient's therapy, giving better coverage for staphylococcus. *Staphylococcus aureus* is acquired postnatally and can cause bullae, erosions, or diffuse superficial desquamation,[39,40](#core-r039) known as the staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, in the newborn. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of a Gram stain and is confirmed by culture. Since staphylococcus is acquired postnatally, lesions should not be present at birth. Therefore, I do not think that the intracellular particles that were found represented staphylococci or other bacteria. I shall discuss the results of the Gram stain in more detail later.Syphilis may be acquired transplacentally by the fetus during pregnancy. Dermatologists are taught the caveat that the rash of syphilis is the great mimicker. It may be papular, macular, or pustular. It may be only vesicular in newborns.[41,42](#core-r041) Vesicles and bullae may occur in any location in neonatal syphilis but are most commonly present on the palms and soles. Although a serologic test for syphilis done on maternal blood was negative we are not told of the timing of the test, and it is possible that the mother acquired syphilis after the test was performed. Newborns with syphilis may have multiorgan involvement and meningitis. The cerebrospinal fluid in this infant was normal. It is extremely unlikely that this newborn had neonatal syphilis because of the absence of multisystem disease and because linear vesicles do not occur with that disease.I shall now proceed to the noninfectious causes of vesiculopustular eruptions in the neonate.Erythema toxicum neonatorum is a self-limited disorder seen in 31 to 72 percent of newborns.[43](#core-r043) It usually develops in the first few days after birth but has been reported at birth.[44,45](#core-r044) The children characteristically have erythematous macules with a central vesicle or pustule.[40](#core-r040) The lesion is distributed principally on the trunk. The experienced physician will usually suspect the diagnosis on the basis of its characteristic appearance, but the diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of sheets of eosinophils on a Wright's stain of the contents of the vesicle or pustule. Peripheral eosinophilia may also be seen. I do not think that this infant had erythema toxicum neonatorum, because the eruption was distributed primarily on the extremities, the morphologic pattern of the lesions was not typical of erythema toxicum neonatorum, and the development of linear lesions on the fourth day of life is not consistent with this diagnosis.Transient neonatal pustular melanosis is seen in 4.4 percent of black infants and 0.2 percent of white infants.[46](#core-r046) It is usually present at birth. Vesicopustules, collarettes of scale, and hyperpigmented macules, 0.5 to 2 mm, may all be present. Vesicles and pustules are not present after 48 hours; only scale and hyperpigmented macules remain. The highest concentration of lesions is usually over the neck and trunk. A Gram stain of a pustule reveals polymorphonuclear leukocytes, although the diagnosis can usually be made on clinical grounds. The vesicles of this infant lasted too long to be those of transient neonatal pustular melanosis. Furthermore, linear lesions have not been described in that disorder.Miliaria, or heat rash, may present as a papular, vesicular, or pustular eruption in the neonate.[40](#core-r040) It is due to excessive warming of the newborn and is not present at birth. Miliaria is a clinical diagnosis that requires confirmation by biopsy only in unusual circumstances.Letterer\u2013Siwe disease is an infantile form of histiocytosis X, which may be present at the time of birth.[47](#core-r047) The clinical appearance of the skin varies considerably. Most commonly, the infants present with an eruption of the scalp and intertriginous areas resembling seborrheic dermatitis. Purpura, pustules, ulcers, and vesicles may also be present. The lesions may be confined to the skin, but more commonly there is multiorgan involvement. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy. The lack of multiorgan involvement and the absence of the characteristic morphologic pattern make Letterer\u2013Siwe disease very unlikely in this infant.Congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis is considered by some observers to be a variant of Letterer\u2013Siwe disease.[48](#core-r048) On light-microscopical examination the diseases seem to be identical, but differences are noted on electron-microscopical examination. Although patients with congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis may have vesicles, the most characteristic morphologic pattern is that of erythematous or blue papules and nodules. Linear lesions have not been described in any of the histiocytic syndromes. Thus, that diagnosis is unlikely as well.Urticaria pigmentosa may be present at birth or may develop in the first few months of life.[40,41](#core-r040) Characteristically, one sees tan or reddish-brown macules, papules, or nodules that undergo urtication after rubbing (Darier's sign). Skin biopsy shows a perivascular and epidermal accumulation of mast cells. In the neonatal period vesicles and bullae may develop within the lesions. This child's illness did not fit clinically into a characteristic picture of urticaria pigmentosa.Bullous mastocytosis is another disorder of mast cells that presents in the newborn period.[40](#core-r040) Large bullae and erosions are the rule; vesicles are usually not present. Thus, the disorder in this infant is not consistent with that diagnosis either.\"Epidermolysis bullosa\" is a term that includes a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders characterized by easy blistering of the skin.[49,50](#core-r049) Bullae and erosions may be present at birth. The usual methods of handling infants, including gentle rubbing, may produce large bullae and erosions, a phenomenon known as Nikolsky's sign. The infant under discussion did not have fragile skin or erosions, and therefore that diagnosis can also be discounted.Dermatitis herpetiformis causes vesicles and hemorrhagic crusts, predominantly on the extremities. It has been observed at birth.[51\u201353](#core-r051) However, on carefully reviewing the clinical and histologic descriptions in those cases I believe that they fit into the diagnosis of incontinentia pigmenti and do not fulfill the criteria necessary for the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis. I shall return to incontinentia pigmenti shortly. True dermatitis herpetiformis[50,54,55](#core-r050) has to my knowledge never been reported in a newborn.Pemphigus vulgaris[56](#core-r056) and herpes gestationis[57](#core-r057) may cause blisters at birth. Infants acquire antibodies to the skin transplacentally. Since we are not told that the mother had either of these conditions, I shall assume that the baby was not afflicted by either of them.Incontinentia pigmenti is an inherited genodermatosis that is seen almost exclusively in females. The disease is also known as the Bloch\u2013Sulzberger syndrome, melanoblastosis cutis linearis sive systematisata, melanosis coria degenerativa, and Asboe\u2013Hansen's disease.[58](#core-r058) Although Bloch[59](#core-r059) named the disease and is often given credit for the first description of it in 1926, careful review of the literature[60](#core-r060) shows that it had been described by Garrod[61](#core-r061) 21 years earlier. Sulzberger[62](#core-r062) described Bloch's original case in detail, including the histopathologic findings. Bloch and Sulzberger noted melanin in the upper dermis, which they assumed had traveled down from the basal-cell layer of the epidermis, a phenomenon that is known as pigment incontinence, thus explaining the choice of the term \"incontinentia pigmenti.\" Recognizing the multiphasic nature of the skin lesions and the commonly associated abnormalities of other organs, Haber[63](#core-r063) proposed the designation \"Bloch\u2013Sulzberger syndrome.\"Incontinentia pigmenti is a bizarre and fascinating disorder, with more than 600 reports in the world's literature. The most comprehensive review of the disease is by Carney.[60,64\u201370](#core-r060) In its most typical presentation erythema or vesicles, or both, are present at birth. At this stage it may be very difficult to distinguish the disease from erythema toxicum neonatorum. The vesicles may be scattered initially but usually develop in a linear pattern. The lesions are generally most pronounced on the extremities. Linear yellow vesicles[71,72](#core-r071) and pustules[68](#core-r068) may be seen, as described in the infant under discussion. Recurrent crops of vesicles may continue to appear for months[64,65](#core-r064) or occasionally for years.[73](#core-r073) During the vesicular stage of incontinentia pigmenti leukocytosis and in particular peripheral eosinophilia are common.[64](#core-r064) Biopsy of a lesion in the vesicular stage shows an intraepidermal accumulation of eosinophils[74](#core-r074); occasionally, basophils have also been noted.[75](#core-r075) A Wright's or Giemsa stain shows sheets of eosinophils. The Wright's stain in this case was examined for the presence of multinucleated giant cells, but no comment was made on the leukocytes in the preparation. The Gram stain showed questionable granules, but granules should not be visible in leukocytes unless the specimen is underdecolorized. It is possible that the physicians interpreting this Gram stain were actually seeing the granules of eosinophils or basophils rather than of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.After the vesicular stage or sometimes concomitant with it the verrucous stage occurs. Linear warty plaques appear on the extremities. These lesions are sometimes confused with verrucous epidermal nevi. The vesicular and verrucous stages of the disease usually resolve, leaving normal-appearing skin, but post-inflammatory pigmentary changes and atrophy may remain. In the verrucous stage histologic examination reveals that the epidermis is acanthotic and hyperkeratotic, with papillomatosis.[74](#core-r074)In the third stage of incontinentia pigmenti peculiar brown whorls and swirls occur in an irregular pattern. This pigmentation has been likened to splattered paint. It is most pronounced on the trunk, but the extremities may be involved to a lesser degree. Examination of a skin-biopsy specimen shows melanin in the papillary dermis and some vacuolization in the basal-cell layer.[74](#core-r074) This constellation of histologic findings is known as incontinence of pigment (melanin). Such pigment incontinence also occurs in a number of other dermatologic diseases, including lichen planus and cutaneous lupus, and a definitive diagnosis cannot be made by biopsy at this stage. It was originally believed that the pigmentation in incontinentia pigmenti is the end result of prior inflammation in the skin. The pigmentation cannot be entirely postinflammatory in origin, however, since most of the lesions in the early phases of the disease are on the extremities and most of the pigment in the third stage of the disease is on the trunk.[76](#core-r076) The pigmentary stage disappears after a few years, although careful examination of adults with the disease often reveals a few remaining lesions.The first three stages of incontinentia pigmenti may coexist in the same patient. As many as 40 percent of the patients are born with lesions in the second or third stage.[64](#core-r064) Earlier stages are assumed to have occurred in utero. When only the pigmentary changes are present, differentiation from a systematized nevus may be impossible unless there is a family history of incontinentia pigmenti. A fourth stage of the disease is described in some reports.[77,78](#core-r077) Clinically, there are hypopigmented, slightly atrophic macules. On histologic examination epidermal atrophy may be found.Incontinentia pigmenti is seen almost exclusively in females. A number of longitudinal studies of patients with this disease have been published.[60,73,79\u201381](#core-r060) What emerges from these studies is the virtual absence of affected males and an increased rate of spontaneous abortion in mothers with incontinentia pigmenti. Most authors believe that the disease is X-linked dominant and lethal in males ([Fig. 3](#f003)).[60,64,82,83](#core-r060) If the mother has incontinentia pigmenti she has a 50 percent chance of contributing a normal X chromosome and a 50 percent chance of contributing an affected X chromosome to the zygote. If the female embryo receives a normal X chromosome from the mother and a normal X chromosome from the father the infant will be unaffected. If the female embryo receives an incontinentia pigmenti X chromosome from the mother and a normal X chromosome from the father the child will have incontinentia pigmenti. If the embryo is male it can receive a normal X chromosome from the mother and a normal Y chromosome from the father and thus be unaffected. However, if a male embryo receives the incontinentia pigmenti X chromosome from the mother the infant would presumably have incontinentia pigmenti. Male embryos with the abnormal chromosome are so severely affected by the disease that they are assumed to die in utero, accounting for the 23 percent frequency of spontaneous abortions in affected families.[82](#core-r082) Why aren't female embryos aborted? In females, according to the Lyon hypothesis,[84](#core-r084) one of two X chromosomes in each cell is inactivated. That means that enough normal X chromosomes will be present for the infant to survive. The Lyon hypothesis may also explain why some children are more severely affected than others since the inactivation of the X chromosome is random, and in some children more abnormal X chromosomes are present, causing a greater expression of the disease.The skin of the embryo grows in a precise and orderly pattern.[85](#core-r085) Although initially it was thought to be random, the peculiar pattern of whorls and swirls seen in the third stage of incontinentia pigmenti occurs in a horizontal pattern on the trunk, linearly on the extremities, and in rings on the scalp, following Blaschko's lines.[85\u201387](#core-r085) The Lyon hypothesis may explain the \"splattered paint\" quality seen in this disease.[85\u201387](#core-r085) If the X chromosome in a particular cell on the skin is normal, normal skin results. If the X chromosome in a cell is affected, the skin appears abnormally hyperpigmented. Since the inactivation of the X chromosome is totally random, the detailed pigmentary pattern is unique to each affected person.Occasional males with incontinentia pigmenti have been described.[88\u201391](#core-r088) Some of them have Klinefelter's syndrome,[89](#core-r089) but others have a normal karyotype.[91](#core-r091) Half-chromatid mutation may account for this occurrence.[90](#core-r090) Spontaneous mutations probably occur in incontinentia pigmenti, since only 55 percent of the patients have a family history of the disease.[64](#core-r064) However, the true frequency of spontaneous mutations is probably considerably lower than this figure would suggest, since adult females with the disease are often phenotypically normal. There is an increased frequency of chromosomal instability in some patients with incontinentia pigmenti,[92\u201394](#core-r092) but no uniform abnormality has been found.Incontinentia pigmenti is a multisystem disease. In a review of 653 cases Carney[64](#core-r064) found that 80 percent of the patients had systemic manifestations, although the true prevalence of associated anomalies may be much lower because of underreporting of mildly affected patients. Thirty-five percent of the patients had disorders of the central nervous system. Newborns may have microcephaly, hydrocephalus, seizures, or hypotonia. The hypotonia in this patient was probably related to hypoxia at the time of birth, and the infant was apparently neurologically normal by the second day of life. However, the hypotonia may have been a subtle sign of neurologic impairment. Although many patients with incontinentia pigmenti are very intelligent, 16.4 percent of them are below average in intelligence[64](#core-r064) and severe retardation may occur.Eye abnormalities are seen in 35 percent of the patients, and those resulting in substantial visual impairment are found in 19 percent of the patients. Conjunctivitis, uveitis, neovascularization, and cataracts may be present in the newborn with incontinentia pigmenti,[95](#core-r095) and every child in whom the disease is suspected should have thorough eye examinations periodically. The conjunctival injection noted on the third day of life in the infant under discussion might have been caused by a chlamydia infection or eye drops given at birth, but it could also have been an early sign of chorioretinitis or another ocular lesion.Dental anomalies are seen in 65 percent of patients with incontinentia pigmenti.[64](#core-r064) Partial anodontia is the most common, but conical or pegged teeth are the most characteristic dental anomaly.[96](#core-r096) These teeth are particularly susceptible to dental caries, and partial or complete loss of teeth by adulthood is common. Dental peculiarities may be the only remaining sign of incontinentia pigmenti in an adult.Carney[64](#core-r064) found peripheral eosinophilia of greater than 5 percent in 74 percent of the patients. The eosinophilia was greater than 15 percent in over 65 percent of the cases in which it was reported. Eosinophils are present in the vesicular skin eruptions as well. The reason for the blood eosinophilia is not known. Leukotriene B4, which is chemotactic for eosinophils, has been demonstrated in the skin of patients with incontinentia pigmenti.[97](#core-r097) It is probable that this baby will be found to have eosinophilia if an accurate counting method is used. Alopecia occurs in 38 percent[64](#core-r064) of the patients. Nail dystrophy is seen in 7 percent.[64,98](#core-r064) A variety of other anomalies may be seen in incontinentia pigmenti, but none of them are seen with sufficient frequency to be considered an intrinsic part of the syndrome.[99](#core-r099)For the sake of clarification I should mention incontinentia pigmenti achromians, which is also known as hypomelanosis of Ito. This is a completely different inherited neurocutaneous syndrome in which swirls of hypopigmentation are present at birth. Neuromuscular and ocular anomalies may also occur.[100](#core-r100)My diagnosis in this case is incontinentia pigmenti. If I had to pick one reason it would be the description of the linear papulovesicles that occurred on the fourth day of this child's life. Since I have placed so much stock on the linear array of the lesions, it might be useful to list briefly other linear dermatoses that occur in infancy[87,101](#core-r087) ([Table 3](#t003)). Several of these disorders follow Blaschko's lines and are X-linked dominant, like incontinentia pigmenti. The only vesicular linear eruptions in newborns are herpes zoster infection and zosteriform herpes simplex infection, and I have already dismissed these diagnoses for other reasons. For the sake of completeness I must also mention that linear lesions can occur by two other mechanisms, although they are not applicable to the case under discussion. When an inflammatory process occurs in a linear structure below the skin, linear inflammation develops in the overlying skin. Examples of this phenomenon are thrombophlebitis, polyarteritis nodosa, and lymphangitis. The other mechanism comes into play when in certain diseases, such as psoriasis, trauma leads to the formation of new linear lesions. This process is known as the Koebner, or isomorphic, phenomenon. Could the new eruption that occurred on the fourth day in the patient under discussion have been a drug eruption? No, because drug rashes from antibiotics are not linear.[102](#core-r102) Therefore, my conclusion that the child had incontinentia pigmenti stands. I suspect that if her mother had been closely examined, hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation of the skin or abnormalities of the teeth or eyes, or all these findings, might have been seen. By questioning the maternal grandparents a history of blisters during the mother's infancy might have been obtained. Spontaneous abortions may have occurred between the birth of this child and that of her healthy six-year-old sister.I think that the diagnostic procedure was a skin biopsy. However, dermatologists who are familiar with the disease state that it is so characteristic when seen in its typical form that a well-trained eye is all that is necessary to make the diagnosis.Dr. Arthur R. Rhodes: Do you have any idea what the placental lesions might have been?Dr. Rothman: The small yellow lesions in the placenta could have been microinfarcts, which are commonly seen in term placentas. Alternatively, could the placental vesicles have been a sign of incontinentia pigmenti? Since 40 percent of patients with incontinentia pigmenti are born with lesions of the second or third stage, it is logical to assume that in these cases the vesicles occurred in utero and might have involved the placenta as well as the fetus. However, after extensive searching I was unable to find any reports of incontinentia pigmenti in which placental lesions were described.Dr. Eugene J. Mark: Dr. Rhodes, what was your impression before the diagnostic procedure?Dr. Rhodes: We saw this baby on the first day of life and every day or twice a day thereafter, because she had such a problematic presentation. It was only on about the fourth day that there was linearity of the papulovesicles. Before then the rash was nondescript, changing not only from day to day but even from hour to hour in terms of its intensity and distribution. In view of the linearity of the vesicles and papules my diagnosis was incontinentia pigmenti, and that is why we performed the skin biopsy. My own review of the Gram stain revealed no obvious bacteria. There was a peculiar granularity, however. We did not see eosinophils or multinucleated giant cells on the Tzank smear.Dr. Mark: Dr. Warren, you saw the patient for the Infectious Disease Service. Do you have a comment?Dr. Shaw Warren: We were very concerned about the history of herpes simplex infection in the mother and the lesions on the infant. We thought, therefore, that treatment with acyclovir was warranted, in particular because untreated herpes simplex infection in a neonate is an overwhelming illness. We also failed to detect organisms on the Gram stain. We recommended continuing oxacillin until the results of cultures returned because of the possibility that the lesions might have been superinfected, although we did not believe that the primary cause was staphylococcal infection.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Michael J. Imber: Examination of a punch-biopsy specimen of skin obtained on the fifth day ([Fig. 4](#f004)) revealed an inflammatory infiltrate within the papillary dermis and the epidermis. In the epidermis there were also scattered clusters of hypereosinophilic, dyskeratotic cells above the basal-cell layer. The infiltrate in the papillary dermis included lymphocytes as well as many intact and degranulated eosinophils ([Fig. 5](#f005)). The epidermis had a pattern of \"eosinophilic spongiosis\" \u2014 the formation of numerous eosinophilcontaining intraepidermal microvesicles ([Fig. 6](#f006)). In contrast to certain eczematous and immunobullous eruptions that are also characterized by eosinophilic spongiosis, the background epidermis in this recent biopsy specimen did not display an excessive amount of interkeratinocytic edema, but suprabasilar aggregates of aberrantly keratinizing or dyskeratotic keratinocytes were observed. This pattern of dyskeratosis is unlike the keratinocytic abnormalities typically associated with primary interface forms of dermatitis, including lichen planus, lupus erythematosus, graft-versus-host disease, and other disorders that clearly are not in the clinical differential diagnosis in this case. The combination of these findings, a superficial lymphoeosinophilic infiltrate, eosinophil-containing intraepidermal microvesicle formation, and suprabasilar dyskeratosis is diagnostic of the initial vesicular phase of incontinentia pigmenti.The vesicular eruption was still present on the 11th day ([Fig. 7](#f007)). The lesions appeared to follow the systematized Blaschko-line distribution. On the 28th day many of the lesions had a hyperkeratotic serous crust ([Fig. 8](#f008)). These changes herald the onset of the verrucous phase of incontinentia pigmenti. Microscopical study of lesions during this phase demonstrates a prominent irregular psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia without the eosinophil-containing microvesicles that characterize lesions of the vesicular phase. Suprabasilar aggregates of dyskeratotic cells persist, with a striking hyperkeratotic and parakeratotic stratum corneum. In the later hyperpigmented stage of incontinentia pigmenti there is a prominent papillary-dermal accumulation of melanophages resulting from epidermal keratinocytic pigment incontinence. The epidermal pathologic pattern is much less pronounced than in the earlier phases. Biopsy of the late hypopigmented, atrophic stage usually reveals only mild epidermal atrophy with no inflammatory infiltrate.In summary, the histopathologic findings in the skin-biopsy specimen are diagnostic of the vesicular phase of incontinentia pigmenti.Dr. Mark: Is there any explanation for the resolution of this disease?Dr. Imber: The clinical evolution of incontinentia pigmenti, like that of other dermatoses characterized by a Blaschko-line clinical distribution, apparently follows a genetically dictated program related to the specific X-linked genetic defect manifested by random lyonization. Many other X-linked disorders with cutaneous manifestations, including focal dermal hypoplasia, X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata, and Menkes syndrome, do not resolve spontaneously as part of cutaneous-disease expression. However, there do exist certain latent acquired skin disorders that clinically involve systematization or Blaschkoline distribution. One such disorder, which typically resolves spontaneously, lichen striatus, has histologic features of an interface dermatitis, but with striking suprabasilar dyskeratosis and pigment incontinence.Dr. Rothman: An infectious cause would explain the transient nature of the skin lesions. There is one case report of a five-month-old patient with incontinentia pigmenti in whom herpesvirus was cultured from the skin.[103](#core-r103) However, the failure to culture microorganisms in other patients with incontinentia pigmenti makes it improbable that it has an infectious cause. I agree with Dr. Imber that the predictable sequence of events is probably genetically predetermined.Dr. Donald N. Medearis, Jr.: Dr. Rhodes, do you have information regarding the point raised by Dr. Rothman about the frequency of miscarriages in mothers of such babies? Did this woman have other miscarriages?Dr. Rhodes: There may have been a miscarriage. It was not clear to the mother. She described one occurrence of a missed menstrual period and heavy bleeding, but it was not a clear-cut miscarriage.Dr. Mark: Were you able to talk with the grandmother regarding the mother's appearance as a baby?Dr. Rhodes: We were not able to talk to the grandmother, but it was clear from the mother's memory of her mother's description that she had a similar rash in the first month or two of life, and she did have other temporary changes in the skin. She was uncertain of their nature, however. She pointed out the atrophic streaks on her skin, which helped to confirm the diagnostic impression of incontinentia pigmenti in her baby.Dr. Peter T. Greenspan: Are the lesions in the third stage more susceptible to injury or breakdown?Dr. Rothman: No. In the vesicular stage of the disease the skin may ooze or weep, but this does not happen in the second or third stage.Dr. Jeffrey D. Bernhard: Have any associated abnormalities developed in the patient?Dr. Rhodes: I have been following the baby very frequently with a neurologist, an ophthalmologist, and the primary pediatrician. The baby has been having what appear to be seizures, since the age of six weeks, lasting for a minute several times a day. Electroencephalograms were initially normal; we are continuing to evaluate the patient neurologically. The eye examination was negative initially, but at six months of age the baby was noted to have bilateral cataracts, which are being followed closely. Otherwise she seems to be growing and developing well. When she is not having seizures she is a very happy and bright baby.Dr. Mark: Has the mother received genetic counseling?Dr. Rothman: One of the reasons why it is so important to make this diagnosis is so that genetic counseling can be done. A mildly affected mother may have a severely affected infant and has a 25 percent chance of spontaneous abortion with each pregnancy. This must be clear to the parents when they are deciding whether to have other children.Dr. Rhodes: The mother has received counseling. This disorder is one of the chromosomal fragility syndromes. The presence of chromosomal gaps and breaks has often been documented.[104](#core-r104) No consistent defects have been demonstrated, although immune abnormalities have been associated.[98,105](#core-r098) It is of interest that some investigators have found a heavy infiltrate of basophils in the cutaneous inflammatory lesions.[106](#core-r106) There is some question whether the basophils are reacting to a transient abnormality, an antigenic abnormality, possibly recruiting eosinophils and subsequently disappearing. The cause of the hyperkeratotic response is mysterious, but inflammatory reactions of all types may cause a reactive hyperkeratosis. The pigmentary changes, which are in areas separate from the inflammatory lesions, may also be reactive. I hear about one or two cases of incontinentia pigmenti per year in Boston. I do not have an exact figure of its frequency, however.Dr. Debra Ann Geller: Has the six-year-old sister been affected?Dr. Rhodes: She has normal vision, and her teeth and skin are normal.\n",

      "question": "A seventy-six-year-old man entered the hospital because of pain in the chest.\nThe patient had been well until one year previously, when he began to experience exertional dyspnea and a dull pain in the anterior portion of the chest, which was provoked by exercise and relieved promptly by rest. Two days before admission the chest pain became persistent, accompanied by mild sweating but without nausea. On the day of entry the pain radiated down the right arm for a short time. There was no history of edema, hypertension, diabetes or weight loss.\nPhysical examination revealed a ruddy-faced man in mild distress. The cervical veins were not engorged, and the lungs were clear. The heart was slightly enlarged; no murmur, rub or gallop was heard. The lowrer edge of the liver was palpable 3 cm. below the right costal margin, and its upper border was percussed in the eighth intercostal space; the spleen was not felt. There was no peripheral edema.\nThe temperature was 98\u00b0F., the pulse 68, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 160 systolic, 90 diastolic.\nThe urine gave a + + test for protein, an orange test for sugar and a strongly positive test for acetone; examination of the sediment showed 3 red cells and an occasional white cell per high-power field. The hematocrit was 54 per cent; the white-cell count was 8400, with 84 per cent neutrophils, 5 per cent lymphocytes and 11 per cent monocytes. The glucose was 185 mg., and the urea nitrogen 16 mg. per 100 ml.; the prothrombin content was 100 per cent, and the glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) 13 units. An electrocardiogram (\nFig. 1\n) revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 125, with upward bowing of the ST segments and terminal T-wave inversion in Leads 1, aVL, V\n5\nand V\n6\n.\nOxygen, morphine, warfarin (Coumadin) and a 500-mg. sodium diet were given. The heart rate gradually rose to 120, and the chest pain persisted. On the third hospital day an apical diastolic gallop and a pericardial friction rub were heard transiently, and digitoxin was begun. The blood pressure was 130 systolic, 70 diastolic, in each arm. The SGOT was 142 units. An electrocardiogram disclosed persistent inversion of the T waves in Leads 1, aVL, V\n5\nand V\n6\n; the ST segments were still elevated in Leads V\n5\nand V\n6\n, but had become depressed in Leads 3, aVF, and V\n2\nthrough V\n4\n. On the fifth hospital day the urea nitrogen was 40 mg. per 100 ml., the sodium 141 milliequiv., and the potassium 5.4 milliequiv. per liter; the prothrombin content was 22 per cent.\nOn the next day examination of the heart revealed a localized systolic pulsation high in the left parasternal area. The heart sounds were faint; a Grade 3, crescendo, rough systolic sound was heard along the left sternal border and was widely transmitted over the precordium. The cervical veins were flat, the lungs were clear, and the pulse was 100; the blood pressure was 110 systolic, 80 diastolic, without pulsus paradoxus. An electrocardiogram (\nFig. 2\n) revealed slight elevation of the ST segments in Leads 1, 2, V\n5\nand V\n6\n, with a tiny qr complex in Lead 1 and a small qs complex in Lead aVL. On the seventh hospital day the adventitious sound persisted, the heart rate was 120, and the blood pressure was 90 systolic, 68 diastolic. The twenty-four-hour output of urine remained satisfactory at 1840 ml.; the urea nitrogen was 56 mg. per 100 ml., and the prothrombin content was less than 10 per cent (thirty-eight seconds). During the next three days the blood pressure varied between 80 and 100 systolic, and the precordial sound persisted. The neck veins remained flat, and there was no peripheral edema. On the eighth hospital day an electrocardiogram (\nFig. 3\n) disclosed slight elevation of the ST segments in Leads 1, aVL and V\n4\nthrough V\n6\n, with a small r wave in Lead 1 and a tiny qr complex in Lead aVL; the ST segments were depressed in Leads 3, V\n1\nand V\n2\n. The patient suddenly died on the tenth hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Guillermo C. Sanchez\\*: The basic problem in this case is whether the patient had a myocardial infarct, a ruptured aortic aneurysm or perhaps a combination of the two.I shall start with a discussion of the electrocardiograms. In the first tracing ([Fig. 1](#f001)) the significant findings aside from the rapid rate pf 125 are the slightly low voltage in the limb leads, the somewhat shortened QT interval, the coving of the ST segments, the inverted T waves in Leads 1, 2, aVL, V5 and V6 and the slight prominence of the T waves in Leads V2 and V3. There are no pathologic Q waves. The electrocardiogram taken on the third hospital day has a more bizarre pattern, although some of the differences are perhaps attributable to the waviness of the base line. Slight coving of the ST segments remains in Lead aVL and perhaps in Lead 1, but it certainly has disappeared in Lead 2, and the ST segment has merged with the QRS complex in Leads V5 and V6, with further shortening of the QT interval. On the tracing obtained on the sixth hospital day ([Fig. 2](#f002)) Lead 1 remains abnormal because of the coving, and Lead aVL has changed considerably, having become a QS lead. Because of a lack of changes in the other leads it is possible that the alteration in Lead aVL was due to placement of the patient in a more upright position. The same coving persists in Lead V5 but is no longer present in Lead 6. The final tracing ([Fig. 3](#f003)), in which the findings are somewhat intermediate between the two previous ones, again shows elevation of the ST segments in Leads 1 and aVL. We find a little more of an R wave in Lead aVL than in the previous tracing and persistence of coving in Leads V6 and Lead 6. The voltage is certainly lower than in the first three electrocardiograms. We can perhaps attribute the differences in part to a lack of standardization.In summary, if one omits consideration of the serial changes the most salient and persistent abnormalities are the elevation and coving of the ST segments with inversion of the T waves in some of the leads and the depression of the ST segments in others. The coving and elevation suggest the type of injury to the myocardium that appears early in the course of infarction and generally lasts for only two or three days, but under certain circumstances this pattern may persist for up to six weeks and even for years if a ventricular aneurysm develops. It is also possible, however, that the ST-segment elevations in this case were a reflection of depressions on the opposite side of the heart. Although the tracings provide no conclusive electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction, there is nothing that excludes it, and a few suggestive changes, especially in Lead aVL, are in its favor.The history of exertional dyspnea and dull, aching pain in the anterior portion of the chest that was provoked by exercise and relieved by rest is a textbook description of angina pectoris, and the persistent pain associated with mild sweating and radiation down the right arm that brought the patient into the hospital is entirely consistent with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. There was no evidence of congestive heart failure. The palpable liver was apparently very low lying, and if the upper border was truly in the eighth intercostal space, as described, I assume that the explanation is emphysema. The urine gave a + + test for protein and contained sugar. Although the patient may have received an infusion of dextrose in the Emergency Ward and had glucosuria on that basis, it is frequently found in the presence of myocardial infarction. An investigation of this association in a small series of cases[1](#core-r001), disclosed that of 14 patients with myocardial infarction who had glucosuria when first examined, about half were shown to have frank diabetes, which had not exhibited itself previously, perhaps another quarter had latent diabetes, and the remainder showed no evidence of diabetes subsequently. So for whatever reason, possibly by way of an adrenal stimulatory mechanism, glucosuria may occur with myocardial infarction. The serum glucose level in this case was not very high, only 185 mg. per 100 ml., and initially, at least, the kidneys seemed to be functioning properly.On the third hospital day there began to be intimations of myocardial dysfunction in the form of the appearance of a diastolic gallop and a pericardial friction rub, which were entirely consistent with an infarct in the anterior location suggested by the electrocardiograms. At that point the House Staff presumably had made a diagnosis of myocardial infarction and was treating this man accordingly with anticoagulation and digitalization because of fear of impending congestive heart failure. The rise of the SGOT from a normal level on admission to 142 units is consistent with myocardial infarction, but an elevation of this enzyme is also encountered in cases of severe coronary insufficiency, with a subsequent rapid fall to a normal level. There was little change in the electrocardiographic pattern at this time.The most perplexing and at the same time the most helpful clues in the case record appeared on the sixth hospital day. A systolic pulsation developed high in the left parasternal area, presumably at the level of the second or third intercostal space or thereabouts, accompanied by faint heart sounds and a Grade 3, crescendo, rough systolic sound that was heard over the whole precordium but primarily along the left sternal border. There was still no evidence of frank cardiac failure. It becomes much more difficult at this point to defend a diagnosis of uncomplicated myocardi l infarct If one f one chooses to retain that as the primary diagnosis, one has to assume that either the septum or a portion of the intracardiac muscle had ruptured to produce this new and loud sound, but the presence of the highly placed systolic pulsation is inexplicable on the basis of a myocardial infarct. I wondered at first whether a ventricular aneurysm might be felt that high, but I was unable to visualize how the heart could have been dilated and rotated to present in that location. So if I decide to retain the diagnosis of myocardial infarction I must introduce another lesion to account for the pulsating mass.Dr. W. Hallowell Churchill, Jr.: The pulsation actually was somewhat lower than was described in the patient's record. I would say that it was in the fourth or fifth intercostal space, between the midclavicular and midaxillary lines.Dr. Sanchez: At this point my balloon goes down in flames. The location of the pulsation was the most crucial point in making my diagnosis, and if it was actually 2 or 3 interspaces lower there is no reason why this patient could not have had an anterior myocardial infarct, with the development of a ventricular aneurysm and perhaps a small rupture of the septum.In spite of this change in the description of the pulsation, however, I shall continue the discussion of what I had assumed to be the more probable diagnosis \u2014 namely, a dissecting aortic aneurysm. The absence of a history of hypertension is a point against a dissection. In the series of 17 cases of dissecting aortic aneurysm reviewed by David and his associates[2](#core-r002) all the patients had hypertension at one time, and many of them continued to be hypertensive after admission unless shock developed. The initial cardiac findings in this case are entirely consistent with a dissecting aneurysm. The fact that the blood pressure was equal in both arms is minimal evidence against the diagnosis, but it is not incompatible with it. Neurologic findings consistent with spinal-cord transection or temporary weakness or numbness are found in about 30 per cent of the patients with a dissecting aneurysm.[3](#core-r003) The glucosuria, which I discussed in terms of its possible relation to myocardial infarction, could probably also have been associated with a dissection, and the electrocardiographic changes are compatible with that diagnosis. The electrocardiographic pattern is almost invariably abnormal in a patient with a dissection of the aorta, even though in the early reports on the subject it was stated that a normal tracing is a very helpful clue in distinguishing it from a myocardial infarct. In most cases of dissecting aneurysm of the aorta we see the pattern of left ventricular hypertrophy, in about 25 per cent there is a pattern consistent with a myocardial infarct, in some one finds the changes of coronary insufficiency, and in about 10 per cent the tracings show alterations compatible with pericarditis. There have been several case reports[4\u20136](#core-r004) of patients with ST-segment elevations in the absence of myocardial infarction; the mechanism wasn't clear, but the electrocardiograms were incomplete. A dissection certainly can occlude a coronary artery or by extending into the pericardium can produce some rotation of the heart and perhaps twisting or spasm of a coronary artery, with a resultant pattern of coronary insufficiency in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis.[7](#core-r007)A friction rub is a frequent finding in patients with aortic dissection, and in the majority of the cases death results from pericardial tamponade. Of the 17 patients reviewed by David et al. 14 died in that manner. Smaller leaks are also very common, and uremic pericarditis develops in a number of the patients. In the case under discussion the uremia was not advanced. The transaminase level of 142 units could, I believe, have been due to dissection without myocardial infarction if congestive heart failure had developed, and we do know that there was slight congestion of the liver. A systolic sound or murmur has been described in about 60 per cent of the patients with a dissection, but an even more characteristic finding is an aortic diastolic murmur, which can occur as a result of distortion of the aortic cusps or dilatation of the aorta or merely because of the underlying, long standing hypertension. The development of uremia in this case can be explained by the gradually declining blood pressure or conceivably by an eventual extension of the dissection to involve the renal arteries.I had made a case for a dissection of the aorta without being certain whether or not it was accompanied by a myocardial infarct, a complication that occurs in 20 to 25 per cent of the cases.[4,5](#core-r004) But with the change in the crucial information regarding the abnormal pulsation I am forced to return to a diagnosis of an anterior or anterolateral myocardial infarction, with the formation of a ventricular aneurysm and rupture, either of the septum or of one of the chordae tendineae. If the pulsation was indeed felt in the fourth or the fifth intercostal space there is nothing left that is incompatible with this statistically most likely diagnosis.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Will someone who heard the abnormal sound that developed on the sixth hospital day describe it in a little more detail?Dr. Donald N. Wysham: It was maximal about 5 cm. to the left of the sternal border, intermediate in location between the apex and the sternum.Dr. Roman W. DeSanctis: Did it sound like the systolic component of a pericardial friction rub?Dr. Wysham: At first DR. Howard Corning interpreted it as a friction rub, but later he agreed that it was a systolic murmur.Dr. Paul G. Walfish: Was it pansystolic or an ejection murmur?Dr. Churchill: It was pansystolic.Dr. Peter M. Yurchak: Dr. Sanchez, do you think that this patient had a systolic ballooning of the ventricular wall, such as one may see transiently with myocardial infarction,[8,9](#core-r008) or a true aneurysm with anatomical thinning?Dr. Sanchez: I believe that it was a true aneurysm.Dr. Scully: Dr. DeSanctis, do you have any comments?Dr. DeSanctis: Was the patient febrile during the hospital course, and was the white-cell count ever elevated?Dr. Scully: The temperature remained normal. On the third hospital day the white-cell count was 24,200.Dr. DeSanctis: This is an extremely perplexing case. It is unusual, although possible, for an infarct to cause as much myocardial damage as was indicated by the cardiac enlargement, the pulsation and the gallop in this case without more evidence of infarction on the electrocardiograms. Other possibilities are pericarditis or myocarditis, perhaps of viral origin, which might explain the progressive cardiac deterioration. Such a diagnosis would not explain the murmur, however. The other diagnosis that comes to mind when confronted by any patient in whom a murmur develops together with progressive cardiac deterioration is bacterial endocarditis, but there is little evidence for that disease. As atypical as the picture is, I have to agree with the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.Dr. Yurchak: Dr. Sanchez, wouldn't you expect the neck veins to have become distended if the interventricular septum had perforated?Dr. Sanchez: Yes, unless the rupture was small enough to produce a noise without resulting in a significant left-to-right shunt and signs of increasing failure.Dr. Yurchak: You mentioned rupture of the chordae tendineae as a possibility, but do you know of any cases in which that occurred as a complication of myocardial infarction? To my knowledge none have been reported.[10](#core-r010)Dr. Sanchez: It is my impression that it occurs, but I am unable to furnish a specific reference.Dr. Yurchak: The fourth-year students were divided among the diagnoses of a ruptured papillary muscle, a ruptured ventricular aneurysm and ventricular rupture secondary to a myocardial infarction. Mr. Zacharia was the student discusser and will give us his diagnosis.Mr. Laurence Zacharia: I diagnosed a dissecting aneurysm of the ascending aorta, with occlusion of a coronary artery resulting in an acute anterolateral myocardial infarct.Dr. DeSanctis: I is unusual for a dissection in that are to proress in a etograde fashion int the pericardium without the development of a murmur of aortic regurgitation.Dr. Scully: Dr. Churchill, will you tell us your interpretation of this case before the patient died?Dr. Churchill: With the development of the systolic murmur, on the sixth hospital day, we thought that the most likely possibilities were rupture of the interventricular septum or perhaps of some of the chordae tendineae, complicating an underlying myocardial infarction.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Scully: The heart was slightly hypertrophied, and sectioning disclosed a fairly large recent infarct of the anterolateral basal portion of the left ventricle. We found no structural thinning of the wall in the region of the infarct, but there certainly could have been an abnormal pulsation in that area as a result of the extensive muscle necrosis. The infarct also involved the anterolateral papillary muscle, a small lateral portion of which had ruptured so that a fragment of muscle was floating in the circulation, attached by only 2 or 3 of the chordae tendineae of the posterior mitral leaflet ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The chordae themselves were intact, and I agree with Dr. Yurchak that rupture of the chordae is not a complication of a myocardial infarct; it is the papillary muscle to which the chordae are attached that ruptures. We were unable to find thrombosis of any of the large coronary arteries, but the left circumflex branch showed very severe narrowing by an arteriosclerotic plaque. Microscopical examination revealed that the infarct extended into the pericardium, where a small coronary artery was infarcted and partially thrombosed. Although much of the necrosis was consistent with a duration of twelve days, in some areas it appeared more recent and might have been caused by the secondary involvement of the coronary artery. There was also an organizing fibrinous pericarditis. In the right kidney we found a small infarct that appeared to be of five or six days' duration, and a few red cells had appeared in the urine in the last few days of the patient's life. This infarct was probably of embolic origin, although we did not find a mural thrombus in the heart.We believe that in this case the onset of the murmur can be explained by the partial rupture of the anterolateral papillary muscle, with resultant mitral regurgitation. The failure of the patient's condition to deteriorate suddenly when this complication developed must have been due to the fact that the rupture involved only a portion of the muscle. According to two recent reports[11,12](#core-r011) from the Tulane University Medical School a systolic murmur can also develop in a patient with a myocardial infarct when the anterolateral papillary muscle becomes necrotic but does not rupture. That type of murmur, which occurs late in systole, is attributed to the failure of the necrotic papillary muscle to contract and exert tension on the chordae tendineae during the final phase of closure of the mitral valve. Such a murmur according to these authors should be distinguishable from that caused by rupture of a papillary muscle, which should give rise to a pansystolic murmur. In this patient's medical record Dr. Edwin O. Wheeler and Dr. Howard Corning stated that the murmur was not pansystolic but was short and of the ejection type, so there seems to have been a difference of opinion about its nature. If it was a short ejection murmur it is possible that it was initially due to infarction without rupture, and that rupture occurred terminally.Dr. Wysham: Dr. Wheeler thought at the time that the murmur was due to mitral incompetence, caused by weakening rather than rupture of a papillary muscle.Dr. Yurchak: A striking feature of the murmur was that it was loudest along the lower left sternal border and faded out toward the axilla, unlike the usual murmur of mitral insufficiency. It's of interest that the posterior leaflet was involved by the rupture in this case. When the chordae of that leaflet rupture the murmur radiates medially and not into the axilla, as with the usual murmur of mitral insufficiency.[10](#core-r010)DR. DeSanctis: Isn't it more commonly the posterior papillary muscle that ruptures with myocardial infarction?Dr. Scully: Yes; in about two thirds of the cases the posteromedial muscle is involved.[13](#core-r013)Dr. DeSanctis: In those cases one hears a more typical murmur of mitral regurgitation. A murmur that is maximal along the lower left sternal border is a little more suggestive of perforation of the interventricular septum.Dr. H. Walter Jones, Jr.: Was this patient receiving glucose intravenously when the blood sugar test and urinalysis were performed? Was anything further done to diagnose or treat the diabetes?Dr. Churchill: He was not given glucose intravenously.Dr. Scully: Another urinalysis a few days before the patient's death again showed glucose.\n",

      "question": "A 74-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of a radiologic abnormality of the left kidney.\nShe was well until six weeks earlier, when she began to have an intermittent rise of the temperature to 38.3\u00b0C, accompanied by malaise, listlessness, and pain in the left flank. Five days before admission she entered another hospital. On examination she appeared well apart from overweight and mild pallor. A Grade 1 apical systolic murmur was heard. Abdominal, pelvic, and rectal examinations were negative. The urine was normal except that the sediment contained 12 white cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 28.9 per cent, and the hemoglobin 9.6 g per 100 ml; the white-cell count was 12,100, with 84 per cent neutrophils. The urea nitrogen was 23 mg per 100 ml (8.2 mmol per liter), and the bilirubin 0.4 mg per 100 ml (6.8 \u03bcmol per liter). An intravenous pyelographic examination revealed calcification within the pelvis, probably in a uterine leiomyoma; the right kidney and its collecting system and ureter appeared normal; no opacification of the left kidney or its collecting system was observed; no mass was seen; the bladder was slightly indented superiorly by the uterus. A barium-enema examination was negative. A retrograde pyelographic study (\nFig. 1\n) disclosed that the left ureter was slightly dilated and contained multiple serpiginous filling defects; the intrarenal collecting system was moderately dilated, irregular in outline, and filled with irregular defects; no calcifications were seen; the ureteropelvic junction was not well opacified. The patient was transferred to this hospital.\nThere was a remote history of pulmonary tuberculosis. A right oophorectomy and appendectomy had been performed many years before entry. The patient denied hematuria, nausea, vomiting, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatic fever.\nThe temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the pulse 80, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared pale but otherwise well. The lungs were clear. A Grade 2 systolic ejection murmur was heard at the base of the heart. The breasts were normal. Abdominal examination was negative; tenderness was elicited at the left costovertebral angle.\nThe urinary specific gravity was 1.016 and the pH 5.0; there was a trace-positive test for protein; the sediment contained 5 white cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 32.4 per cent, and the hemoglobin 10.4 g per 100 ml (6.5 mmol per liter). The white-cell count was 10,200, with 89 per cent neutrophils. The reticulocyte count was 2.2 per cent. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 142 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 15 mg per 100 ml (5.4 mmol per liter), the creatinine 1.3 mg per 100 ml (114.9 \u03bcmol per liter), the glucose 173 mg per 100 ml (9.6 mmol per liter), the iron 25 \u03bcg per 100 ml (4.5 \u03bcmol per liter), and the iron-binding capacity 220 \u03bcg per 100 ml (39.4 \u03bcmol per liter). The serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) was 11 U per milliliter (1 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 233 U per milliliter (3.9 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), and the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 6 mU per milliliter (0.1 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter). The third, fourth, and fifth LDH isoenzymes were elevated. In a 24-hour specimen of urine the creatinine was 764 mg (6.8 mmol) per kilogram of body weight. X-ray films of the chest showed two calcified nodules in the lower lobe of the left lung, consistent with healed granulomas; the heart was slightly enlarged. A percutaneous selective angiographic examination (\nFig. 2\n) revealed that the aorta was tortuous and bowed to the right at the level of the left kidney; the right kidney appeared normal; the left kidney was enlarged, with evidence of a neovascular supply that arose from the renal artery and the second and third lumbar arteries; hydronephrosis was seen at the upper pole; perfusion of the lower pole was diminished; a few parallel linear vessels coursed from the medial portion of the kidney toward the midline. A left renal venographic examination disclosed complete occlusion. An ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys demonstrated a normal appearance of the right kidney; the left kidney was diffusely enlarged, with generalized distortion of its architecture; a trilobate lucent structure in the upper pole gave the appearance of a hydronephrotic calyceal complex, and a large area of mixed echoes was seen in the central portion of the kidney. A computed body tomographic (CBT) scan of the abdomen (\nFig. 3\n) showed a normal appearance of the right kidney; the left kidney was enlarged, with areas of low attenuation consistent with hydronephrosis in its upper pole; a solid mass extended medially from the kidney, displaced the aorta to the right, and obliterated normal fat planes around the psoas muscle. After the intravenous infusion of contrast material an opacified structure that appeared to be the left ureter was seen anterior to the lower portion of the left psoas muscle. Cytologic examination of urine was negative for tumor cells. A culture of urine yielded a few colonies of\nEscherichia coli\nand of\nStaphylococcus epidermidis\n.\nThe temperature rose daily to 37.9 to 38.1\u00b0C. An operation was performed on the sixth hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Morton A. Bosniak\\*: This 74-year-old woman entered the hospital because of fever, malaise, listlessness, and pain in the left flank. The pertinent laboratory findings were anemia, a slight leukocytosis with a shift to the left, and a greatly elevated sedimentation rate. The urinalyses revealed 5 to 12 white cells per high-power field but no red cells. A few colonies of *Esch. coli* and *Staph. epidermidis* were grown on culture.I shall review the radiologic findings at this point. The intravenous urograms show a normal right kidney; the left kidney is not visualized. There is no evidence of calcification or calculi in the region of the left kidney or along the course of the ureter, but a calcified uterine leiomyoma is visible in the pelvis.The retrograde pyelographic examination may be the most helpful radiologic study in this case ([Fig. 1](#f001)). The pyelograms show a number of cast-like filling defects in the left ureter. Some of them are up to 8 cm in length, and others are shorter with an irregular worm-like appearance; all of them appear entirely intraluminal. Defects that are similar but more irregularin outline fill the renal pelvis. The upper-pole calyx is dilated and is clearly irregular in outline. The infundibulum to the lower pole is elongated and distorted and also contains irregular defects as well as one elongated cast-like defect. The other calyxes and infundibular structures are not opacified and presumably were obstructed or filled with similar material.The possible causes of the filling defects in the renal pelvis are a urothelial tumor, a renal-cell carcinoma extending into the renal pelvis, blood clot, inflammatory debris (also called mucopus), radiolucent stones, and fungous balls. The elongated filling defects in the ureter were probably due to clotted blood, mucopus, fungous balls, or fibrous polyps. By far the most common cause of elongated filling defects within the ureter of the type seen in this case is clotted blood. Blood-clot casts result from extensive renal bleeding and may obstruct the collecting system. Such clots are usually dissolved by the action of urokinase, but if the kidney is not functioning they may remain intact. Urinalysis failed to reveal red cells on two occasions, and the patient apparently never noticed blood in her urine. If these cast-like defects in the ureter were caused by blood clots, either the patient had been unaware of gross hematuria or there was total obstruction at the left ureterovesical junction. Since a catheter was passed through the ureterovesical junction into the ureter, apparently without difficulty, total obstruction was not present, although the retrograde pyelograms show slight dilatation of the left collecting system suggesting relative obstruction. Therefore, the defects in the left ureter were probably not due to clotted blood. However, if they were blood clots the possibility of a neoplasm deserves serious consideration, and both renal-cell carcinoma with invasion of the collecting system and urothelial carcinoma, either transitional-cell or squamous-cell, are diagnostic possibilities. Transitional-cell carcinoma is the most likely explanation in view of the irregularity of the collecting system in the renal pelvis with projections that appear almost papillary. This finding is most evident in the lower-pole infundibulum.Mucopus, or inspissated pus, which is made up of a number of components, including protein, mucus, sloughed tissue, and pus, can fill the collecting system, giving an appearance somewhat similar to that demonstrated in the renal pelvis in this case. Mucopus is seen in patients with severe inflammatory disease of the kidney, often associated with poor drainage of the collecting system. The presence of some white cells in this patient's urine supports that possibility. Although the appearance of the filling defects in the renal pelvis is consistent with mucopus, the extent of the cast-like defects in the ureter would be distinctly unusual on that basis. Fungous disease could also produce filling defects of this type. There has been an increasing number of reported cases of primary and secondary candidiasis and aspergillosis with obstruction by casts resembling fungous balls in the collecting system. In most of the cases casts of this type have been associated with a debilitating disease, long-term steroid therapy, previous instrumentation, antibiotic treatment, or diabetes.[1\u20133](#core-r001) Gerle[4](#core-r004) suggested that if filling defects are seen in the collecting system in a patient without hematuria candidiasis should be considered. Another cause of worm-like filling defects in the ureter is the presence of fibrous polyps, which are rare benign tumors that can be confused with blood clots radiographically. These tumors, which may cause urinary-tract obstruction, are mentioned for the sake of completeness but are not worthy of serious consideration in this case.The next radiologic study was an abdominal aortographic examination with selective left renal arteriograms. The aortogram shows the extent of the large mass involving the left side of the abdomen ([Fig. 2](#f002)). The left renal artery appears atrophic, and there are findings indicative of hydronephrosis, particularly in the upper pole of the left kidney, with atrophy of the vessels and loss of their secondary and tertiary branches. However, on a film from the magnification selective study, which was performed with an injection of a high dose of contrast material, we see evidence of hypervascularity, with multiple small, irregular branches arising from stretched atrophic branches of the renal artery that supply the parenchyma. There appears to be hypertrophy of the renal pelvic artery, and many areas of irregular neovascularity are seen, particularly near the lower pole of the kidney. The aortogram shows deviation of the aorta to the right side by the large mass in the left flank and considerable hypertrophy of the second and third and possibly fourth lumbar arteries, which are also supplying the kidney and perirenal spaces.This arteriographic pattern can be seen with both neoplastic and inflammatory processes. The wild neovascularity of a renal-cell carcinoma was not demonstrated, and there was no evidence of arteriovenous shunting characteristic of that tumor. On the other hand, the angiographic findings in this case are compatible with a renal-cell carcinoma, since its appearance ranges from the typical one of a highly vascularized mass with \"tumor vessels\" to that of a less vascular infiltrating neoplasm or a hypovascular cystic or solid lesion.[5](#core-r005) The angiographic pattern demonstrated in this case can also be seen with a urothelial tumor, either an extensive transitional-cell carcinoma or, less likely, a squamous-cell carcinoma.[6,7](#core-r006) The latter, however, is more often an invasive and encasing neoplasm, unlike the mass in this patient. Very evident on the angiograms is extensive perirenal hypervascularity, indicating that the process extended from the kidney to involve at least Gerota's fascia and probably the pararenal tissues as well. That finding is typical of a renal-cell carcinoma, which tends to extend from the kidney and parasitize the adjacent blood supply.The angiographic picture in this case could also be produced by renal sarcomas and lymphomas, as well as chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis of the tumefactive variety, which is often indistinguishable from a carcinoma, either angiographically or clinically.[8](#core-r008) Although the extremely irregular, tortuous vascularity characteristic of renal-cell carcinomas is not seen in cases of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, the type of neovasculature, the perinephric and pararenal involvement, and the hydronephrosis associated with hyperemia in the kidney demonstrated in this case are compatible with an inflammatory process.[9](#core-r009) Other renal inflammatory masses with extension into the perinephric space might also give rise to this angiographic pattern. However, tuberculosis is usually associated with vascular encasement and amputation, [10](#core-r010) which was not demonstrated on these films, and there is very little angiographic experience with extensive fungal disease. Unfortunately, an angiographic tissue signature is not present in this case.The left renal venograms disclose complete occlusion of the left renal vein near the hilus of the kidney just proximal to the left adrenal vein. The obstruction was due to an intrinsic thrombus, possibly a tumor thrombus. This finding was suggested on the arteriographic examination, since the renal vein is not demonstrated on the venous phase of the selective study, and collateral veins draining the left kidney are barely visible. Occlusion of the renal vein, as seen in this case, is most characteristic of renal-cell carcinoma but occurs occasionally with large, bulky, invasive urothelial carcinomas[11](#core-r011) and rarely with inflammatory disease, both xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis and fungous disease.[12](#core-r012)The renal ultrasound study demonstrates a diffusely enlarged left kidney with a paucity of echoes except for an area of increase in its central portion. There is a hydronephrotic calyceal pattern in the upper pole corresponding to the hydrocalyx shown in the retrograde pyelograms. The sonographic pattern is nonspecific but suggests the diagnosis of a lymphoma because of the relative sonolucency or possibly a poorly attenuated liquid process such as pus formation in portions of the kidney. A somewhat similar appearance might be seen in a case of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.[13](#core-r013) The sonographic pattern is not that of the usual renal-cell carcinoma or other types of solid tumor with dense echoes but could be seen with an obstructing tumor of the renal pelvis accompanied by hydronephrosis. Incidentally, there is no evidence of shadowing indicative of stones in the renal pelvis, making radiolucent stones an unlikely cause of the pelvic filling defects.The last of the radiologic studies was a computed tomographic scan of the abdomen ([Fig. 3](#f003)). Unfortunately, the examination is of substandard quality because of streak artifacts due to the large amount of gas in the transverse colon and the relatively slow scanning time of the equipment. The findings do confirm, however, the presence of a large mass in the left flank, with thickening of perinephric tissue and Gerota's fascia, pararenal involvement with thickening of the psoas muscle, and extension of the mass from the renal hilus to the paraaortic area. The CBT scan indicates that the process was even more extensive than is appreciated on the aortogram. The findings suggest the diagnosis of renal-cell carcinoma with extension into the perirenal tissue and metastases to hilar and paraaortic lymph nodes. A similar picture might be seen with a Stage 4 transitional-cell carcinoma or a lymphoma, but I would expect a more homogeneous infiltrating pattern, with obliteration and replacement of the entire perirenal outlines if the latter were the explanation for the findings. An inflammatory disease could also be responsible for this appearance if it extended outside the kidney and produced thickening and edema of Gerota's fascia, the adjacent psoas muscle, and lymph nodes. However, in view of the size of the paraaortic lymph nodes in this case a neoplasm is more likely on the basis of the CBT examination.The history is not helpful in terms of arriving at a diagnosis. The findings on the radiologic studies were obviously of longer duration than six weeks, the duration of the clinical manifestations. The elevated glucose level on one occasion is of interest, but we do not know whether it was in a fasting or postprandial sample and therefore whether it indicates that she had diabetes. It would be important to establish that diagnosis because if the patient had diabetes, inflammatory disease, particularly of fungal origin, would have to be considered more seriously.A renal-cell carcinoma that had grown into the renal pelvis, spread into the perirenal space, metastasized to the hilus and paraaortic lymph nodes, and extended into the renal vein could explain all the radiologic findings, but only those on the renal venogram and possibly the computed tomographic study are characteristic of that tumor. If this patient did have a renal-cell carcinoma the filling defects in the ureter must have been due to blood clots. It is difficult to justify such a diagnosis, however, because when a renal-cell carcinoma extends into an unobstructed collecting system it should produce marked hematuria, and there was no indication of hematuria in this case.The next diagnosis to be considered is a urothelial carcinoma, either a transitional-cell carcinoma or, less likely, a squamous-cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis. The pyelographic finding of collecting-system filling defects is most consistent with such a diagnosis. Urothelial carcinomas can infiltrate, replace, and obstruct the kidney but involve the perinephric tissues to the extent demonstrated in this case much less often. Also, they extend into the renal vein less frequently than renal-cell carcinomas. The pattern of hydronephrosis and the irregular defect within the renal pelvis shown by the ultrasound study are certainly suggestive of a renal pelvic carcinoma, but the absence of red cells on urinalysis and of a history of hematuria is somewhat against that diagnosis.[14](#core-r014)Lymphoma of the kidney is also a possibility in this case. The large, relatively hypovascular renal mass, the enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum, and the sonographic findings suggest a lymphoma, but the changes in the collecting system cannot be explained by it unless a second process, such as a fungous disease, was superimposed. Fungous infection develops in patients with lymphoma who are on chemotherapy, but we have no reason to suspect that complication in a patient with a previously undiagnosed and undetected lymphoma. However, this diagnosis would explain many of the radiologic findings and also the puzzling absence of hematuria.The diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis would account for many of the radiographic findings in this case. The lack of visualization of a kidney on a urographic study of a patient with a large mass in the left flank is a characteristic finding. The retrograde pyelographic demonstration of distortion of the collecting system with irregular filling defects consistent with inflammatory debris provides some additional support for this diagnosis. However, the extent of these filling defects in a system that is not totally obstructed would be unusual. The angiographic findings are compatible with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. Occlusion of the renal vein, although extremely rare, can occur with chronic inflammatory disease, and the CBT findings indicative of perirenal involvement with thickening of Gerota's fascia or psoas-muscle involvement also fit with this diagnosis. The mass that appears to represent enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes was somewhat extensive for this diagnosis, but there is little experience with CBT scanning in cases of extensive xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. Large masses of inflammatory tissue resembling tumors have been found in cases of this condition.[15,16](#core-r015) The sonographic pattern is also compatible with it. However, the clinical history is not characteristic. In 85 per cent of the cases of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis there is a history of nephrolithiasis, previous instrumentation, or chronic urinary-tract infection, and obstruction due to benign and malignant tumors of the renal pelvis has also been implicated in the development of this disorder. None of these factors were known to be present in this case. It is possible, however, that an unrecognized radiolucent stone partly obstructed the left renal pelvis, or that a urothelial tumor obstructed the kidney, causing xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. There are also reported cases of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis occurring without a previous history of obstruction or infection.[8](#core-r008) Most patients with this lesion undergo an operation with a diagnosis of renal-cell carcinoma, and even at operation the surgeons are often unable to make the differential diagnosis.With regard to fungous diseases, there are a number of case reports of primary renal aspergillosis and candidiasis presenting as a large renal inflammatory mass with fungous balls and inflammatory debris obstructing the collecting system. Abscesses and renal-vein thrombosis have also been described in such cases.[12](#core-r012) However, the spread of the disease, particularly the perinephric extension, the pararenal involvement, and the lymph-node enlargement without a history of steroid therapy or a debilitating disease make this diagnosis improbable. Also, there is no mention of culture of fungi in the urine or of identification of them on microscopical examination of the urine. Could tuberculosis, which is the only disease mentioned in the history, produce this picture? That diagnosis is unlikely since there was no evidence of intrarenal calcification, vascular encasement, or amputation of vessels on the angiographic examination or evidence of fibrosis or stricture of collecting-system structures \u2014 all findings characteristic of this disease. Other diagnoses that might account for the unusual filling defects demonstrated on the pyelograms are malacoplakia and keratin-producing cholesteatomas. However, my review of some of the literature on these very rare lesions failed to reveal examples that fit the findings in this case.[17,18](#core-r017)Finally, could this patient have had a combination of two diseases? Should I combine an inflammatory process and a neoplastic process, such as a lymphoma with a superimposed fungous infection or a neoplasm with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, to explain all the findings? A neoplasm has been associated with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis in a number of cases, [15,19](#core-r015) including two reports of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis in a kidney obstructed by a transitional-cell carcinoma.[6,20](#core-r006) I have seen two examples of squamous metaplasia that progressed to squamous-cell carcinoma in a chronically infected xanthogranulomatous kidney. In general, one does not like to make a diagnosis based on two diseases, but at times varied findings are best explained in this fashion. If the two diseases are known to be associated occasionally, this combined diagnosis is a reasonable alternative.In summary, the radiologic studies have outlined a large mass that replaced and destroyed the left kidney, but neither these findings nor the clinical features of the case enable me to make a definitive diagnosis. Examination of material in the left ureter by passage of a brush catheter into its distal portion to collect debris or washings might have been of more diagnostic value than many of the radiologic studies. Since information of this type is not available to me, I must make a diagnosis with which I am not entirely satisfied. My final diagnosis is carcinoma of the renal pelvis, probably of transitional-cell type. I cannot rule out a superimposed infection, possibly xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.Dr. Richard C. Pfister: Dr. Bosniak, have you seen a striate linear pattern of the type that appeared to represent the renal vein on the selective renal arteriogram in this case in diseases other than renal-cell carcinoma?Dr. Bosniak: That pattern has been described in association with renal-cell carcinoma, [21](#core-r021) and I have not seen it with any other condition. However, it was very difficult to see in this case, and I could not be certain of its presence.Dr. Karl H. Proppe: How do you explain the negative cytologic examination?Dr. Bosniak: I assume that the specimen examined was voided urine. The frequency of a positive examination of such a specimen is fairly low. We have to assume that very little urine was coming from the left collecting system, and if that is true a single negative cytologic examination would not influence me. I would be much more influenced if the specimen was taken from the ureter, since the chance of obtaining a positive test would be much higher under those circumstances.[22](#core-r022)\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Alex F. Althausen: We concluded that this patient had a neoplasm on the basis of the radiologic findings. However, at the time of the cystoscopic examination, which was done before the major procedure, we found a cast composed of grayish tissue that had extended from the ureter into the bladder. Frozen-section examination showed only necrotic debris. The rest of the bladder appeared normal. So we explored the retroperitoneum through a right thoracoabdominal incision. We found a large tumor that had penetrated Gerota's fascia and had extended through the paraaortic region to the contralateral renal pedicle and downward to the bifurcation of the great vessels. We biopsied a paraaortic lymph node, and frozen-section examination of the specimen revealed a poorly differentiated transitional-cell carcinoma. We performed only a palliative nephrectomy. On opening the ureter we found that the cast had extended from the proximal portion down to the bladder, and we removed it with a Fogarty catheter.Dr. Proppe: The specimen that we received included the kidney with a 7.5-cm length of ureter, the adrenal gland, and the surrounding tissue, as well as the cast that was removed from the ureter. The kidney was almost completely replaced by a large, firm to fleshy, yellow-tan tumor that arose in the renal pelvis ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The superior pole was destroyed, and the tumor extended about 8 cm beyond the renal capsule into the adjacent fat. It infiltrated widely in the hilus, entering the lumen of the renal vein. Metastases were present in the hilar lymph nodes. Microscopical examination revealed a transitional-cell carcinoma that varied from an orderly in situ neoplasm in the renal pelvis ([Fig. 5](#f005)) to an anaplastic invasive tumor ([Fig. 6](#f006)). Areas of necrosis within the tumor may account for some of the sonographic and radiographic findings. Examination of the cast from the ureter showed necrotic tumor.The ratio of transitional-cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis to that of the urinary bladder is 3:50 and to transitional-cell carcinoma of the ureter 3:1. Carcinomas of the urothelium are often multifocal, and the frequent association of ureteral and bladder carcinomas with transitional-cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis has been emphasized.[23,24](#core-r023) In this case there was neither dysplasia nor carcinoma in situ in the excised ureter. As Dr. Bosniak mentioned, cytologic examination of voided urine is frequently negative in cases of carcinoma of the renal pelvis; Wagle et al.[24](#core-r024) found that only 24 of 78 patients studied (31 per cent) had a positive cytologic examination. The false-negative rate was attributed to inadequacy of the specimen (5 per cent), nonfunction of the kidneys (16 per cent), and obstruction of ureters (30 per cent), any or all of which may have accounted for the negative cytologic study in this case.A Physician: What is the explanation for the relatively sonolucent character of this mass?Dr. Bosniak: Sonographic findings are often nonspecific. An extensively infiltrating neoplasm that is relatively homogeneous will give a sonolucent appearance.Dr. Proppe: May we have a follow-up report, Dr. Althausen?Dr. Althausen: Since the prognosis for this type of tumor is very guarded, we treated this patient with chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy. Three months after discharge a routine film of the chest revealed a number of nodules consistent with metastases. She remains alive and is not bedridden 14 months postoperatively, but the pulmonary metastases have progressed despite multiple pulses of cisplatinum chemotherapy.\n",

      "question": "A 79-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of an abdominal mass.\nShe was in excellent health until 16 months earlier, when she began to have vague pain in the right side of the abdomen. A physician found mild right abdominal tenderness, without other abnormality. Her weight was 64 kg. The hematocrit was 38.8 per cent. A barium-enema examination and an oral cholecystographic study were negative. Her symptoms appeared to improve. Six months before admission she again experienced right abdominal pain, accompanied by fatigue and anorexia. Three months later examination revealed right abdominal tenderness. Her weight was 59 kg. The hematocrit was 27.8 per cent; a stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. An x-ray film of the chest showed a hiatus hernia but was otherwise normal. An intravenous urographic examination with nephrotomograms showed normal kidneys, pyelocalyceal structures, and ureters. A barium-enema examination disclosed no change, and an upper gastrointestinal series revealed only a hiatus hernia of moderate size. Ferrous gluconate, cimetidine, and an antacid were administered, and the hematocrit became normal during the next six weeks. Abdominal discomfort and anorexia persisted, and she lost another 2 kg in weight. Three weeks before entry an ultrasound study of the abdomen (\nFig. 1\n) showed a solid bilobed mass, 7 cm in diameter, in the region of the porta hepatis; the inferior vena cava appeared dilated; the bile ducts were not distended, and there was no evidence of hepatic parenchymal defects. A\n99m\nTc scan of the liver revealed a large area of decreased activity in its paramedian region; the spleen appeared normal. A computed body tomographic (CBT) scan of the abdomen (\nFig. 2\n) demonstrated a large mass in the vicinity of the pancreatic head that compressed the liver and the right renal vein and distorted the inferior vena cava; with contrast enhancement the lumen of the inferior vena cava appeared obliterated by the mass. One week before entry peripheral edema developed.\nAn appendectomy and a hysterectomy had been performed in the remote past. There was a 20-pack-year history of cigarette smoking. There was no history of jaundice, bleeding, night sweats, hematemesis, melena, or change in bowel habit.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse 70, and the respirations 16. The blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared well. No jaundice or other evidence of liver disease was observed. The lungs were clear. The heart was not enlarged; a Grade 2 midsystolic murmur was heard at the cardiac apex. The edges of the liver and spleen were barely palpable; the vertical span of the liver was 10 cm. There was ++ edema of the left ankle, and + edema of the right ankle. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 36.5 per cent; the white-cell count was 7200, with 56 per cent neutrophils and 4 per cent band forms. The platelet count was 292,000, and the reticulocyte count 2.1 per cent. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 28 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 18 mg per 100 ml (6.4 mmol per liter), the glucose 84 mg per 100 ml (4.7 mmol per liter), the calcium 9.6 mg per 100 ml (2.4 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 4 mg per 100 ml (1.3 mmol per liter), the bilirubin 0.3 mg per 100 ml (5.1 \u03bcmol per liter), the iron 42 \u03bcg per 100 ml (7.5 \u03bcmol per liter), the iron-binding capacity 504 \u03bcg per 100 ml (90.3 \u03bcmol per liter), and the protein 7.8 g (the albumin 4.0 g, and the globulin 3.8 g) per 100 ml. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) was 18 U per milliliter (0.1 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 122 U per milliliter (2 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), the amylase 18 U per milliliter, and the alkaline phosphatase 29 IU (0.5 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n) per liter. A stool specimen gave a + test for occult blood. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was 5.6 ng per milliliter. An x-ray film of the chest was normal. An inferior venacavographic study (\nFig. 3\n) showed a filling defect, 11 by 7 cm, that almost completely obstructed the inferior vena cava at the level of the first lumbar vertebra; the hemiazygos vein was filled at that level as a collateral pathway. An aortographic examination, performed via the right femoral artery, disclosed considerable aortic atherosclerosis and tumor vessels. Selective injection of the common hepatic and splenic arteries demonstrated no evidence of hepatic involvement by tumor; the gastroduodenal artery was well filled and not encased and did not give rise to tumor vessels; the splenic vein was preserved; the portal vein was deviated anteriorly by the mass but did not appear directly involved by it; the right kidney was free of tumor vessels and mass effect; the inferior portion of the right adrenal gland appeared normal.\nAn operation was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. William C. Wood\\*: The salient feature of the clinical evaluation of this elderly woman was the presence of a large mass. Much of the data obtained before admission are related to the anatomical localization of this mass by diagnostic radiographic studies. I'll ask Dr. Ferrucci and Dr. Novelline to demonstrate the findings.\\*Assistant surgeon and co-director, Surgical Oncology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital; assistant professor of surgery, Harvard Medical School.Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: Except for the presence of a hiatus hernia the conventional contrast studies done before admission are negative. I'll demonstrate only one film from the urographic study as a negative examination that was pertinent in terms of what followed. The renal outlines are normal in contour, and the kidneys show normal excretion. There is no evidence of a perirenal soft-tissue mass, and no calcification is evident in the right upper quadrant.The ultrasound examination ([Fig. 1](#f001)) showed a discrete dumbbell-shaped, solid soft-tissue mass intimately related to the porta hepatis. On the transverse images the mass is well marginated and is not associated with any evidence of biliary-duct dilatation or parenchymal space-occupying lesions. The parasagittal views show that the mass was 3 cm to the right of the midline, projecting into the posterior aspect of the liver and extending into the lumen of the inferior vena cava. The lumen of the vena cava is dilated craniad and caudad to the mass, suggesting obstruction of blood flow. The 99mTc liver scan reveals an area of photon deficiency in the right hepatic lobe, with no other hepatic abnormality and no evidence of splenic enlargement. A computed body tomographic scan ([Fig. 2](#f002)) again demonstrates the bilobed mass extending ventrally into the porta hepatis and dorsally involving and apparently replacing the inferior vena cava. The lesion is seen in intimate contact with both the vena cava and the head of the pancreas. The body and tail of the pancreas appear normal. On a scan obtained after the infusion of iodinated contrast material the only area of opacification is a small slit-like collection of contrast material along the dorsal aspect of the mass, which was interpreted as a markedly compressed residual lumen of the inferior vena cava.Dr. Robert A. Novelline: An anteroposterior view from the inferior venacavographic study ([Fig. 3](#f003) *A*) reveals a mass, 11 by 7 cm, expanding the inferior vena cava and compromising its lumen. Collateral flow of contrast medium can be seen in the azygos venous system. On the lateral projection ([Fig. 3](#f003) *B*) the intracaval mass is sharply circumscribed and ovoid. It is attached to the anterior wall of the vessel, and contrast medium flowed around it posteriorly, correlating with the findings on the CBT scan. In both projections the inferior vena cava is in the normal position; it is not deviated by a mass in any adjacent organ. An aortogram discloses minimal irregular tumor vascularity in the area of the mass. A hepatic arteriogram shows no evidence of tumor vascularity in the liver, but displacement of the hepatic-artery branches around the mass is evident. A venous-phase film from the splenic arteriographic study demonstrates patency of the splenic vein and the portal vein, although the latter is displaced anteriorly and bowed by the mass. No tumor vascularity is seen on the right renal arteriogram. The gastroduodenal artery and its branches appear normal.Dr. Wood: In the case record there is the teasing statement that \"the inferior portion of the right adrenal gland appeared normal.\" Did its superior portion appear abnormal, or was it not seen?Dr. Novelline: A selective adrenal artetiographic examination was not performed. However, the right inferior adrenal artery is opacified on the right renal arteriogram, and as a result the base of the right adrenal gland is seen. There is no evidence of a mass in that portion of the adrenal gland.Dr. Wood: We must determine the nature of a solid, bilobed mass in the region of the porta hepatis that filled and distorted much of the inferior vena cava at the level of the first lumbar vertebra. The differential diagnosis of a subhepatic mass is extensive. Inflammatory masses seldom grow so quietly, without fever, chills, and marked elevation of the sedimentation rate and alkaline phosphatase and LDH levels. Therefore, I shall proceed to a consideration of neoplastic masses.A hepatoma can arise in this region, but the findings on the arteriographic study and other studies suggest an extrahepatic lesion that compressed the liver. A pancreatic tumor can also occur in this location and can invade the inferior vena cava, but against that diagnosis is the lack of impingement on the common bile duct or pancreatic duct. The gastroduodenal artery was demonstrated on the selective angiographic study, and it was not encased or a source of tumor vessels. A right adrenal tumor could invade the vena cava or the renal vein. Adrenal medullary pheochromocytomas are associated with hypertension, sweating, and anxiety. The description of this woman's illness does not fit that pattern, nor was there any indication of a functioning adrenocortical tumor in the form of Cushing's syndrome or virilization. Adrenocortical carcinomas are nonfunctional, however, in almost half the cases.[1](#core-r001) The radiographic studies do not support a primary adrenal location, and if the mass had been an adrenocortical carcinoma of this size I would expect it to have invaded the liver. A renal-cell carcinoma could also invade the inferior vena cava, but the very clear radiologic studies discount that diagnosis.I am left with a diagnosis of either a lymphoma or a retroperitoneal sarcoma. On the CBT scan there is no indication of involvement of para-aortic lymph nodes adjacent to the tumor. It is very unlikely that a lymphoma would attain this size and invade the vena cava without involvement of other lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum. In the category of sarcomas are fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, malignant schwannoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and hemangiopericytoma. The definitive diagnosis in this type of case is made on histologic examination, and the task of the surgeon is exploration and biopsy or resection. However, for purposes of this exercise I must attempt to arrive at a preoperative diagnosis. I am strongly influenced by the fact that the only site demonstrated to be involved by this neoplasm was the inferior vena cava. The most common primary tumor of the inferior vena cava is a leiomyosarcoma, but it is rare, with only about 50 cases reported in the literature.[2](#core-r002) Over 80 per cent of these tumors occurred in women, predominantly in later life; in fact, of all soft-tissue sarcomas the leiomyosarcoma is the one that is seen latest in life.[3](#core-r003) The first leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava was described at autopsy by Perl[4](#core-r004) in 1871. The diagnosis was made only at post-mortem examination for many years. In 1971 the case of a leiomyosarcoma high in the inferior vena cava was presented at one of these exercises[5](#core-r005); it had grown into the hepatic veins, producing the Budd-Chiari syndrome, as well as into the right atrium and led rapidly to death. A recent report from this hospital by Brewster, Athanasoulis, and Darling[2](#core-r002) reflects the progress in both the radiographic delineation of these rare tumors and their surgical management with the assistance of radiography.The symptoms produced by a leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava reflect the level of involvement and the amount of associated thrombosis. Tumors of the proximal portion may produce the Budd-Chiari syndrome and extend into the heart. Tumors in that category are unresectable. Those that occur in the midportion of the inferior vena cava at about the level of the renal veins, however, are sometimes amenable to surgical resection, which involves removal of the inferior vena cava from the hepatic veins to the bifurcation as well as sacrifice of the renal veins. The left kidney can survive because it has sufficient collateral circulation, but the right kidney usually cannot and must either be resected or, if its presence is essential, may be reimplanted in the fashion of a transplant into the right groin. A leiomyosarcoma in the lower portion of the inferior vena cava can be resected by removing the vessel to its bifurcation, with minimal morbidity. These tumors are usually well circumscribed and lend themselves to resection. Less than half the patients have had synchronous metastases, although later spread to the lungs and liver has been common.The carcinoembryonic antigen level was elevated at 5.6 ng per milliliter. Only 1 per cent of former smokers in this hospital will have such a high CEA level, and I suspect that it was related to the tumor in this case. The patient also had iron-deficiency anemia, and occult blood was found in the stools. Therefore, the question of an occult second tumor in the gastrointestinal tract is raised, but the findings on the upper gastrointestinal series and the barium-enema examination are against that possibility. We are not told about a sigmoidoscopic examination. The hiatus hernia was of sufficient size to be noted on a plain radiograph of the chest. Such large hernias, especially of the rolling or paraesophageal types, are associated with superficial ulcers, localized gastritis, and bleeding. The patient had undergone a hysterectomy in the past, which I assume was not done because of a malignant tumor.The diagnosis of a leiomyosarcoma of the midportion of the inferior vena cava fits with the involvement of that site alone, as well as with the patient's age and sex. The pain, anorexia, and weight loss are consistent with that diagnosis in view of the crowding and the stretching effect associated with the mass. The minimal elevation of the sedimentation rate, LDH, and CEA are also compatible with that diagnosis.Dr. Gerald S. Foster: This patient was under my care. The curious feature was the 16 months' duration of her illness. She was a vigorous, active 79-year-old woman with only vague complaints. The initial studies were routine ones to explain the right-sided abdominal pain. In the midst of the investigations she said that she was feeling better and then didn't return for almost a year, when the pain recurred. She had lost weight and had an iron-deficiency anemia. The rest of the gastrointestinal workup revealed a sizable hiatus hernia, which I thought might have been the cause of the postprandial discomfort and the iron-deficiency anemia. Although the anemia responded to the administration of iron the symptoms persisted. We then proceeded to the ultrasound and CBT studies, which revealed the mass. The radiologists suggested the diagnosis of a leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava. The tumor seemed to involve or replace the head of the pancreas, and our differential diagnosis was between a leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava and a pancreatic cancer that had extended into it. The edema had been minimal until shortly before admission.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Bodnar, may we have the medical students' diagnosis?Dr. Andrew G. Bodnar: They thought that the mass was a leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. George L. Nardi: I thought initially that the patient had a pancreatic tumor on the basis of the findings on the CBT scan. However, having recalled the patient to whom Dr. Wood referred, on whom I operated several years ago, I suspected the diagnosis of a leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava, which was supported by the angiographic studies. Unfortunately, the tumor in this case proved to be more extensive than the one that we had seen previously and was not resectable.Dr. Jaime Prat: According to the operative report, the tumor involved the middle third of the inferior vena cava and had two major components, as previously indicated by the radiographic studies. An extravenous nodular, hard mass, 5 cm in diameter, surrounded the inferior vena cava and the right ureter and was adherent to the right kidney. The intravascular component of the neoplasm, 10 cm in length, extended from the right renal vein to the level of the diaphragm and involved the hepatic veins. Microscopical examination of a small biopsy specimen obtained from the extravenous mass revealed a proliferation of atypical smooth-muscle cells arranged in intersecting bundles ([Fig. 4](#f004) and [5](#f005)). On high-power examination the cells had abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated nuclei with blunted edges. Although nuclear pleomorphism was moderate, the number of mitotic figures, which is generally one of the most important prognostic indicators in cases of smooth-muscle neoplasia, was very small. We concluded that if the biopsy specimen was representative of the entire neoplasm it could be classified as a leiomyosarcoma of low malignant potential. The growth of the tumor around the right ureter supports the interpretation of the malignant nature of the tumor.Primary leiomyosarcomas of large veins are rare, involving most often the inferior vena cava. Since the initial description of this neoplasm by Perl,[4](#core-r004) only 62 cases have been reported in the world literature.[2,6\u201316](#core-r002) Recently, however, these tumors have been recognized more often because of the use of modern techniques in diagnostic radiology, and in 34 of the 62 cases the diagnosis was made before autopsy during the past 10 years. An interesting feature of this neoplasm that remains unexplained is the striking female preponderance. Forty-two of 51 patients whose sex was recorded were women, most of them 50 years of age or older. Approximately 25 of the reported tumors involved the upper third of the inferior vena cava (above the level of the hepatic veins) and were associated with the Budd\u2013Chiari syndrome \u2014 i.e., hepatomegaly, jaundice, ascites, and edema of the lower extremities. About a fourth of the tumors in this location extended into the right atrium; one resulted in obstruction of the tricuspid valve,[17](#core-r017) and another projected into the infundibulum of the pulmonary artery and caused pulmonary tumor embolism.[18](#core-r018) The tumors involving the middle third of the inferior vena cava are usually associated with renal-vein thrombosis and the development of the nephrotic syndrome. One case of renovascular hypertension attributed to compression of the renal artery by the neoplasm has been reported.[19](#core-r019) Leiomyosarcomas of the lower third (below the renal veins) generally produce varying degrees of edema of the lower extremities, but important degrees of edema are uncommon unless secondary venous thrombosis occurs.[2](#core-r002) Although most of the tumors that have been reported originated in the middle third, the majority of them ultimately involved the upper third as well. That occurrence is unfortunate because most, if not all, of the upper-third tumors are inoperable, whereas those of the middle and lower thirds are more manageable surgically.[2](#core-r002)Most of the reported tumors have been described as \"slow-growing\" and \"of low malignant potential.\" Direct invasion of the adjacent organs is a late complication, and metastases were present in less than half the cases at the time of the diagnosis. The most common sites of spread were the liver (17 per cent) and the lungs (15 per cent).[7](#core-r007)Dr. Scully: Dr. Shipley, will you tell us how you treated this patient after the diagnosis was made?Dr. William U. Shipley: Patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas are best treated by surgical resection and adjuvant radiation therapy. However, because this large tumor was unresectable we decided, after considerable intraoperative discussion, to administer radiation therapy alone. This approach may be successful for low-grade sarcomas.[20](#core-r020) The size of this tumor, its ill-defined superior border, and its vascularity dissuaded us from attempting intraoperative radioactive implantation with 125I seeds, as we have done for other unresectable retroperitoneal tumors.[21](#core-r021) Instead, the patient was treated postoperatively with external beam techniques, with the use of multiple fields of both 25 MV x-rays and 160 meV protons. This plan allowed us to limit the radiation dose to the liver, left kidney, and spinal cord to a satisfactory degree. However, because we knew that the duodenum would be the tissue limiting the radiation dose in this case, Dr. Nardi and Dr. R. Clement Darling inserted a layer of omentum, 1 to 2 cm, between the tumor and the second and third portions of the duodenum at the time of exploration. The patient tolerated a dose of 6500 rads to the tumor in eight weeks, with minimal upper gastrointestinal complaints.A Physician: Is chemotherapy effective in this type of case?Dr. Wood: Sarcomas generally respond poorly to most forms of chemotherapy, but many have responded to doxorubicin. Two features were against its use in this case. The first was the patient's age, which would make it difficult for her to tolerate well a drug that is toxic to the bone marrow as well as the heart. Secondly, the tumor was very low-grade.A Physician: If resection is possible, what is the best way to replace or repair the inferior vena cava?Dr. Wood: Unfortunately, there is no good way to repair or replace it. So it is simply resected.\n",

      "question": "First admission\n(1966). A 47-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of diarrhea.\nShe was well until two years earlier, when a cholecystectomy was followed by crampy lower abdominal pain and the urgent passage of loose, watery stools of small volume, often accompanied by mucus, without blood or pus. The attacks lasted for three to four days and were followed by a symptom-free interval during which she passed two to three stools daily. Eight months before entry she traveled to Mexico and noticed exacerbation of the symptoms. Repeated stool cultures gave no growth of pathogenic bacteria. An upper gastrointestinal study and a barium-enema examination, performed at another hospital, were reported to be negative. Various medications were administered, without improvement. One week before admission she traveled to Puerto Rico and again had recurrence of symptoms.\nFifteen years previously she underwent excision of an anal fissure and multiple cryptectomies because of pruritus and pain on defecation; no abdominal cramps, diarrhea or urgency of stool occurred at that time. An appendectomy had been performed in the past, and there was a remote history of a duodenal ulcer.\nThe temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 80, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg.\nOn examination she appeared well. Physical examination was negative.\nThe urine was normal. The hemoglobin was 13.4 g per 100 ml; the white-cell count was 7100, with 67 per cent neutrophils, 11 per cent band forms, 15 per cent lymphocytes, 5 per cent monocytes and 2 per cent eosinophils. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 26 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 12 mg, and the protein 6.2 g (the albumin 4.2 g, and the globulin 2.0 g) per 100 ml. The alkaline phosphatase was 3.5 Bodansky U. On sigmoidoscopic examination the distal 10 cm of the rectosigmoid appeared normal; in the proximal 10 cm there were 5 or 6 discrete, shallow ulcerations, 5 mm in diameter, which bled on wiping; the surrounding mucosa appeared normal except for several small swellings thought to be mucoceles. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. Microscopical examination of a fresh stool specimen disclosed cysts of\nGiardia lamblia\n. Examination of four additional stool specimens showed no parasites, ova or amebae. The patient was discharged on the second hospital day on quinacrine hydrochloride.\nSecond admission\n(four months later). The patient's symptoms did not improve. Sulfasalazine was administered but was discontinued because of nausea and abdominal pain. Succinylsulfathiazole was given, and the pain decreased. One month before entry a gush of blood clots was passed per rectum. Two weeks later sigmoidoscopic examination to 20 cm was negative. The urine was normal. The hemoglobin was 12.4 g per 100 ml, and the white-cell count 13,000. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. Two weeks before admission the abdominal pain and cramps worsened. Diarrhea recurred six days before admission and progressed in severity. One day before entry succinylsulfathiazole was resumed, but severe epigastric pain developed, with radiation to the back, and was likened by the patient to the pain previously experienced from cholecystitis and duodenal ulcer. The pain was not affected by food or position and was accompanied by nausea and vomiting. On the day of admission the diarrhea became more severe and was associated with streaks of blood.\nThe temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 100, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 105/60 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared fatigued and dehydrated. The abdomen was protuberant; the bowel sounds were hyperactive but of normal pitch; tenderness was elicited in the right lower quadrant. Rectal examination disclosed slight thickening of the mucous membrane.\nThe urine was normal. The hemoglobin was 13 g per 100 ml; the white-cell count was 10,700, with 69 per cent neutrophils, 7 per cent band forms, 19 per cent lymphocytes, 3 per cent monocytes, 1 per cent eosinophils and 1 per cent basophils. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 38 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 10 mg, the bilirubin 0.2 mg, and the protein 5.7 g (the albumin 3.8 g, and the globulin 1.9 g) per 100 ml. The amylase was 8 U, the glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) 14 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 3.5 Bodansky U. A stool specimen gave a + + test for occult blood. Sigmoidoscopic examination to 18 cm revealed moderate mucosal edema; no ulcers were observed, but several pitted areas, 1 mm in diameter, were seen, and there was moderate friability on wiping; much stool was present, thick, runny and foul, with considerable mucus. An x-ray film of the chest was normal. An upper gastrointestinal series with small-bowel study was negative. A barium-enema examination (Fig.\n1\nand\n2\n) showed retained mucus and fecal material within the colon; the cecum was hyperirritable and filled poorly, particularly along the medial wall; the ileocecal valve was prominent, and barium refluxed freely into the terminal ileum, which appeared slightly dilated, with poor mucosal detail; several inconstant marginal filling defects were seen in the transverse colon; on several films there was a suggestion of serration of the margin of the barium column; evacuation was incomplete, and the mucosal coating was poor.\nMeperidine was administered. The patient remained afebrile; abdominal pain and diarrhea continued. On the sixth hospital day prednisone was begun in a dose of 40 mg daily. On the 10th hospital day a second barium-enema examination demonstrated that the colon filled readily and appeared pliable, with normal haustrations; on several films there was a suggestion of a filling defect near the hepatic flexure, but it was attributed to a prominent peristaltic contraction; the cecum was small and distended poorly, with free reflux into a normal-appearing terminal ileum; the evacuation of the barium was poor.\nOn the 17th hospital day lower abdominal pain developed and was unrelieved by the passage of stool. An x-ray film of the abdomen showed a moderate quantity of gas within the colon, particularly in the transverse portion; nodular soft-tissue defects were seen within the air column, and the haustral pattern was irregular. Prednisone was discontinued, and cortisone was begun in a dose of 300 mg daily. Methadone was administered for pain. On the 19th hospital day bloody, diarrheal stools were passed on three occasions. Examination revealed that the lower abdomen was distended, with high-pitched tinkling sounds; tenderness was elicited over the left quadrants. Rectal examination yielded maroon feces that gave a + + + + test for occult blood. Sigmoidoscopic examination to 15 cm revealed a normal mucosa covered by bloody mucus and old, bloody stool; the source of bleeding was proximal to the area examined. On the 21st hospital day the abdomen remained distended and tender, with high-pitched bowel sounds, and the patient repeatedly passed bloody, diarrheal stools.\nOn the 25th hospital day adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was begun in a dose of 40 units daily by vein. On the following day an x-ray film of the abdomen showed an increase in the distention of the transverse colon and splenic flexure, with dilatation of the sigmoid colon; the bowel wall appeared thickened, and nodular indentations on the air column were observed. On the 27th hospital day the abdominal pain was more severe, and the distention more prominent. No stool was passed. Examination disclosed that the abdomen was tympanitic, with diffuse tenderness, guarding and rebound tenderness, without localization; the bowel sounds were absent. An x-ray film of the abdomen (\nFig. 3\n) again showed distention of the transverse and sigmoid colon; multiple loops of moderately dilated small bowel were evident in the lower portion of the abdomen, and moderate gastric dilatation was observed; no air-fluid levels were noted. Nasogastric and rectal tubes were inserted, and fluids were given intravenously. On the following day the abdominal pain improved; the distention continued, and infrequent bowel sounds were heard. The patient passed a small amount of liquid stool via the rectal tube. The temperature rose to 38\u00b0C. The hemoglobin was 14.1 g per 100 ml. The white-cell count was 2500; in a differential count of 50 cells there were 8 neutrophils, 22 band forms, 8 lymphocytes, 2 prolymphocytes, 6 monocytes and 4 eosinophils; the platelets and red cells appeared normal. The protein was 3.6 g (the albumin 2.3 g, and the globulin 1.3 g) per 100 ml. A stool culture yielded a growth of normal bowel flora. Tetracycline was begun, and infusions of blood plasma were given daily.\nDuring the next three days the temperature ranged between 37.7 and 38\u00b0C daily. A hematologic consultant found that the bone marrow appeared normal except for striking myeloid dominance with a shift to the left. The hematocrit was 35 per cent, and the white-cell count 1300. On the 31st hospital day rectal examination revealed a boggy sensation, with diffuse tenderness and a gush of liquid stool. The hematocrit was 43 per cent, and the white-cell count 1600. The platelet count was 40,000. An x-ray film of the abdomen demonstrated an increase in the dilatation of the small bowel, with prominent air-fluid levels in the erect position; the colon appeared less distended with air; no free air was recognized, but the shadow of the diaphragm was not included on the erect film.\nAn operation was performed on the 31st hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Edwin P. Maynard, III\\*: In summary, this problem concerns a 47-year-old woman who had had diarrhea for over two years before her first admission to this hospital in 1966. The major findings at that time were small ulcers in the rectosigmoid, disclosed by sigmoidoscopic examination, and *Giardia lamblia*, identified on parasitologic study. She was discharged on a trial of quinacrine therapy, which was unsuccessful over the subsequent four months. On the second admission the investigation was focused on inflammatory bowel disease, based on the radiographic findings and also the repeated sigmoidoscopic examination, which revealed friability of the mucosa. With this diagnosis in mind the attending physicians treated her with prednisone, intravenously administered hydrocortisone and ACTH. The course in the hospital over a period of a month was one of progressive deterioration, inanition with abdominal distention, increasing tenderness, a suspicion of perforation and finally the radiographic picture of toxic megacolon. She was then explored, presumably with the intention of performing a subtotal colectomy, again apparently with inflammatory bowel disease as the working diagnosis.In contemplating the differential diagnosis in such a case one can conclude quickly that the list of possibilities is brief. Indeed, aside from the obvious problem of inflammatory bowel disease, whether ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, only amebic colitis merits serious consideration. One might give passing thought to tuberculosis, other bacterial infections and other parasitic infestations, but none seem to fit the findings in this case. So I shall focus on the notoriously treacherous differential diagnosis between amebic colitis and inflammatory bowel disease.One of the cornerstones in assessing this problem is the radiographic appearance of the bowel. In approaching clinicopathological conferences over the years I have sometimes reviewed the films in advance with a radiologist. On other occasions I've decided that it was more appropriate to wait and look at the films on the day of my discussion. This time the elements forced me to choose another course. When I went to Dr. Ferrucci's office to review the films with him I found that he was at home shoveling snow. So I looked at the films unaided and was able to reach my solitary, unbiased conclusions. Armed only with those conclusions I shall now ask Dr. Ferrucci for his expert consultative opinion.Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: All the available films are from the second admission. The upper gastrointestinal study shows no abnormality. In particular, there is no indication of residual duodenal-cap deformity or mucosal inflammatory change, as might be found in a patient with giardiasis. The small bowel is also normal, with no evidence of involvement of the terminal ileum.The findings on the two barium-enema examinations are similar (Fig. [1](#f001) and [2](#f002)). The descriptions by the fluoroscopists indicated an extremely irritable colon, particularly in the transverse and ascending portions, with a great deal of mucus, spasm and fecal residue. The ascending colon remained contracted almost completely, with inadequate distention of the cecum. A spot film from the region of the hepatic flexure and transverse colon reveals broad, irregularly deformed haustral folds, another indication of the muscular spasm and irritability in the colon. A second spot film of the transverse colon demonstrates a nodular contour defect ([Fig. 2](#f002) *A*), which, although inconstant, was interpreted as an area of mural thickening. The description of marginal serrations in the case record has to be accepted as evidence of ulceration, although the films now available do not show that abnormality convincingly. The final finding of interest is in the region of the cecum ([Fig. 2](#f002) *B*), which appeared contracted and poorly distensible on both studies. The ileocecal valve does not seem unusually edematous or thickened, and there was abundant reflux into the terminal ileum. In the distal small bowel we see a somewhat granular mucosal pattern consistent with reflux of transudate or fecal slush, but there is no narrowing or active ulceration. The two barium-enema studies were done within the first 10 days in the hospital. The first abnormal plain film of the abdomen, obtained on the 17th hospital day, demonstrates mild distention of the colon in the transverse portion and splenic flexure. A film obtained nine days later shows increased distention and marginal defects along the wall, especially on the undersurface of the transverse colon. A film taken on the 27th hospital day ([Fig. 3](#f003)) reveals appreciable distention of the transverse colon, again with a nodular contour, and there is also distention of the sigmoid colon, with dilatation of several loops of small bowel. The diameter of the transverse colon and the nodular contour of its wall are classic radiographic signs of a toxic megacolon. There is no indication of gas in the bowel wall.Dr. Maynard: In addition to inflammatory bowel disease and amebiasis, are there any diagnoses that come to your mind from the radiographic standpoint?Dr. Ferrucci: For the sake of completeness one would have to consider some of the other diffuse colonic disorders that could be associated with negative cultures, including a pseudomembranous colitis or an ischemic process, which can mimic inflammatory bowel disease.Dr. Maynard: If you were going to make a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, given the distribution of the disease and the radiologic characteristics, would you classify this process in the category of ulcerative or granulomatous colitis?Dr. Ferrucci: At the time that the patient was examined ulcerative colitis was the initial diagnosis made by the Department of Radiology. Granulomatous colitis, which was just becoming recognized at that time, was also included in the differential diagnosis, as was amebiasis. The absence of prominent ulcerative changes in the distal colon and the apparent spasm and contraction in the ascending colon place the differential diagnosis between granulomatous colitis and amebiasis, although the eventual development of toxic megacolon is a little less likely with either of those disorders.Dr. Maynard: Are the films adequate to exclude mucosal disease in the small bowel?Dr. Ferrucci: I think so. With the amount of fluid that was reported to be in the lumen of the colon, I suspect that the cause of the granularity in the distal ileum was just fluid that backwashed rather than intrinsic ileal disease.Dr. Maynard: Is the cecal deformity that you described characteristic of the so-called conical cecum seen in patients with amebiasis?Dr. Ferrucci: It is entirely consistent with it. Another feature of interest in terms of the distinction between granulomatous disease and amebiasis is the relative lack of induration of the ileocecal valve and the medial wall of the cecum, which is often a prominent finding in Crohn's disease. The lack of distensibility at the tip of the cecum is also more consistent with amebic infection.Dr. Maynard: What is your interpretation of the nodularity of the transverse colon? Could the nodules have been pseudopolyps or just areas of thickened bowel wall? Does anything suggest local tumor masses \u2014 i.e., amebomas?Dr. Ferrucci: The contour defect of the transverse colon shown on the barium study would have raised the possibility of an ameboma in my mind, but the multiple nodular defects visible on the plain film when the toxic megacolon supervened were probably the result of focal spasm and thickening of the bowel wall.Dr. Maynard: As must be apparent, my impression from the information in the case record as well as the x-ray studies is that this patient had amebiasis. I have already indicated that the differential diagnosis between inflammatory bowel disease and amebiasis is notoriously difficult. If that diagnosis is difficult today, it was even more difficult 11 years ago at this hospital. First of all, in this region inflammatory bowel disease is very common, whereas endemic amebiasis is relatively rare. It is still seen in New England and is not confined to those who have traveled elsewhere. So we always have to keep that possibility in mind. In other parts of the world the situation is reversed. When I was working in Africa every patient with diarrhea was regarded as probably having amebiasis. Indeed, inflammatory bowel disease was so rare that it was usually not in the differential diagnosis, and some of the more difficult cases that we saw there were in that category. In areas where amebiasis is more endemic, such as the southeastern part of this country, we find frequent reported studies emphasizing that the clinical characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease may be indistinguishable from those of amebic colitis.[1](#core-r001) One of the difficulties in the diagnosis of amebiasis is that the trophozoite *Entamoeba histolytica* is an elusive organism. The fact that numerous stool specimens were searched carefully for the organisms in this case simply tells us that they were not found and does not mean that they were not present in the bowel. We should recognize that the examination of fresh stool may not be adequate, and many authorities emphasize that one should try to obtain mucus directly from a lesion via the sigmoidoscope, either by wiping an ulcer or preferably by inserting a catheter through the sigmoidoscope and aspirating mucus directly from a suspected area. By those means the diagnostic yield is clearly improved. Another way to make the diagnosis is by a biopsy. There is some disagreement about what yield one may expect with this approach. Juniper[2](#core-r002) has found that biopsy of an ulcer with serial sections and PAS staining discloses the organisms in up to 82 per cent of the cases. In other hands the yield has been in the range of only 40 to 50 per cent. Nonetheless, biopsy is a helpful additional technic.The sigmoidoscopic findings may be important in the differential diagnosis. If they are typical they are helpful, but most often they are not. The classic picture of amebic colitis is that of discrete areas of ulceration covered by exudate with normal intervening mucosa. In this case the first sigmoidoscopic examination revealed such ulcers, separated by normal mucosa. There is an intriguing comment about small elevations of the mucosa that were interpreted as mucoceles. Similar elevations have also been described in cases of amebiasis and interpreted as small abscesses in the preulcerating phase of the disease. On the second admission the sigmoidoscopic findings were very different. No discrete ulcers were found, and the mucosa was much more characteristic of ulcerative colitis, with diffuse friability of the bowel. We now have an additional tool for the diagnosis of this disease. Since there is often relative sparing of the rectum, and the sigmoidoscopic examination may be negative, it is useful to have at our disposal the colonoscope. With it one can get around into the transverse colon and the cecum and have the benefit of direct visualization and perhaps aspiration or biopsy specimens from areas of greater involvement.I have alluded to the radiographic dilemma that one faces in this differential diagnosis. Everyone who has had experience with this problem has been confronted with the fact that in an individual case it may be impossible to distinguish idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease from amebiasis. Other radiographic problems occur from time to time. For example, one can see stricture of the bowel in amebiasis indistinguishable from that seen in Crohn's disease. Similarly, the pseudopolyposis that occurs with amebic colitis may be most reminiscent of the pseudopolyposis of ulcerative colitis, and amebomas can appear to be identical to malignant tumors.The clinical course deserves comment. I should stress the great variability and the chronicity of amebic colitis. We tend to forget that this disease can persist for years. This patient had had it for over two years, but there are reported cases with a duration of up to 12 years before the diagnosis was finally established.I was interested in the information that the patient had two flare-ups of diarrhea after travel to Mexico and Puerto Rico. One unanswered question about amebiasis is why patients undergo a change from a phase in which they are in happy saprophytic balance with their enteric cystic disease to a phase in which there is invasive disease, when they become seriously ill. One postulation is that enteric bacteria have an important role, and that is one of the bases for the beneficial use of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as tetracycline, which was administered in this case. One wonders whether the patient under discussion had further exposure to amebae in Mexico or Puerto Rico or whether she just had nonspecific travellers' diarrhea, which in turn caused the amebiasis to become more invasive. I favor the latter explanation.If the diagnosis remains elusive as judged by these clinical criteria, one can fortunately now turn to the Serologic Laboratory, which can provide valuable support. In this hospital we currently do an agar-gel immunodiffusion test, and with invasive disease one can expect a positive result in approximately 90 per cent of the cases. We also have available the indirect hemagglutination test, which is done at the Center for Disease Control, in Atlanta, Georgia. We can send a specimen there and get an answer in a few days, and the positive yield in cases of invasive amebiasis is even better, perhaps 95 per cent.[3,4](#core-r003) Since this patient was cared for in 1966 we do not find a report of a serologic test, but my hunch is that if it had been done it would have been strongly positive.What lessons should we carry away from this case? One is that even though a patient may arrive at our doorstep in New England and appear to have inflammatory bowel disease we must always think of the possibility of amebiasis. The two may be indistinguishable, and it is very important to identify amebiasis because if one treats amebic colitis with corticosteroids the end result may be disaster. It seems probable that perforation of the bowel had occurred in this patient by the time of the operation. My concern is that with the falling white-cell count and toxicity she was in a mortality group in excess of 50 per cent, and even if she survived the immediate trauma of surgery there may have been serious problems thereafter. Another lesson is that one must pursue a compulsive effort to identify the trophozoites in every way possible. Finally, if one is in doubt, a therapeutic trial may well be indicated. Metronidazole is now the agent of choice, and one can expect a patient with amebic colitis to show a symptomatic response within a few days. If this patient were being cared for today such a trial would have been indicated.Dr. Austin L. Vickery, Jr.: Dr. Point, will you comment on your experience with this patient?Dr. Warren Point: As Dr. Maynard mentioned, the handling of this patient would be far different in 1977 from that in 1966. Although we suspected the diagnosis of amebiasis, we were confused when she entered the phase of toxic megacolon because at that time toxic megacolon had not been reported except in association with ulcerative colitis. That complication pushed us into thinking that we were dealing with idiopathic ulcerative colitis and not amebic colitis. The tetracycline therapy was begun several days before the operation as a last-ditch effort to cover for infection and amebiasis. In those days the treatment of choice was tetracycline and chloraquine followed by diodoquin. Metronidazole was not yet available, and emetine carried an unacceptable risk, we believed, in a patient without proved amebiasis.The lessons that I learned in this case are much as Dr. Maynard has stated. First of all, 25 years ago I always treated patients with ulcerative colitis with an amebicidal agent before an operation. Not having encountered any benefit over the next 15 years I did not treat this patient on that basis. Since her illness, however, I have resumed amebicidal therapy preoperatively if any suspicion of amebic disease existed. Another lesson is that when giardia is found in a patient who could have both giardiasis and amebiasis \u2014 for example, those who have been in Mexico or India \u2014 I have in recent years routinely given amebicidal doses of metronidazole, even though I didn't find amebae. If the patient has come from Leningrad, Russia, I don't worry so much about amebiasis.Dr. Maynard: Had this woman traveled outside the country before the onset of her illness two years before admission?Dr. Point: Not to my knowledge. Another point is that if hyperalimentation had been available in 1966 she might have survived because most of the postoperative difficulties, which led to death eventually, were nutritional. She was losing about 8000 ml of fluid a day in the ileostomy and abscess drainages, requiring as much as 15 g of magnesium sulfate daily to keep up with the magnesium losses.Dr. Vickery: Dr. Ellis, you were a preoperative consultant.Dr. Daniel S. Ellis: My note in the record points out that this woman did have giardiasis, and the implication is that although giardia was not commonly recognized as a pathogenic agent before that time it was becoming more apparent that it is a pathogen that we have to consider in patients with diarrhea. I made the remark that I had never seen giardiasis cause ulcers, as were described on this patient's sigmoidoscopic examination. However, I thought that she should be treated for giardiasis, and if that proved unsuccessful we had no recourse but to treat her for idiopathic ulcerative colitis in the absence of other positive diagnostic criteria.Dr. Vickery: Dr. Schoolnik, may we have the medical students' diagnoses?Dr. Gary K. Schoolnik: The students concluded that amebic colitis complicated by toxic megacolon and protein-losing enteropathy was more likely than inflammatory bowel disease. They were intrigued by the possible presence of amebomas within the transverse colon and cecum, accounting for the filling defects observed on the barium-enema examination.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Vickery: Dr. Bartlett, you saw this patient a number of times before the decision to operate. Will you tell us your findings?Dr. Marshall K. Bartlett: I saw her in consultation since her condition was getting steadily worse, and what we interpreted as toxic megacolon was beginning to develop. The deterioration progressed to the point where removal of the colon was deemed essential. That was two or three weeks after the x-ray films that Dr. Ferrucci demonstrated. At operation the entire colon and the terminal ileum were involved in an inflammatory process, and in the sigmoid there was a perforation that was walled off against the lateral abdominal wall. We did a total colectomy and had to resect another 30 cm of the terminal ileum because at the point where it was first transected inflammatory changes were found on frozen-section examination. We resected the entire colon, including the rectum, because,in transecting the mid-sigmoid we found that the disease continued below that point. An ileostomy was also done.Dr. Vickery: The examination of the colonic mucosa showed extensive ulcerative disease with a friable and hemorrhagic appearance. The wall of the bowel was edematous in many areas. There was a linear perforation in the upper portion of the sigmoid, with strands of fibrin adherent to the serosal surface, corresponding to the site that Dr. Bartlett described as being walled off (Fig. [4](#f004) and [5](#f005)). The attached and the separately submitted segments of ileum had a combined length of 70 cm and contained numerous hemorrhagic and necrotic mucosal lesions similar to those in the colon; all but the proximal 25 cm of ileum appeared involved. Although there were some atypical features about the appearance of the ulcers, including the extensive involvement of the ileum, the gross pathological impression was that of extensive idiopathic ulcerative colitis.On microscopical examination the mucosal surface was studded with superficial ulcers involving the submucosa but sparing the muscularis, as typically seen in ulcerative colitis. However, an unusual finding for this diagnosis was the minimal inflammatory reaction around the ulcers. Closer examination by a more experienced observer, a visiting alumnus of our department from El Salvador, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Astacio, disclosed pale-staining ovoid bodies in both the exudate and the submucosa, raising the question of amebae. We had at first interpreted these bodies as macrophages, but they proved to have the intense staining with the PAS reaction characteristic of amebae. Myriads of the trophozoite forms of the parasite were present in the exudate overlying the ulcers (Fig. [6](#f006) and [7](#f007)), but relatively few were scattered in the submucosa. This distribution may be the reason why tissue biopsy is not as valuable a diagnostic technic as examination of the exudate.The species name, *Entamoeba histolytica*, which has been applied to this protozoan parasite, is derived from the ability of the organism to lyse tissues, an attribute well illustrated in the present case. In an excellent review of the pathology of human amebiasis Brandt and P\u00e9rez Tamayo,[5](#core-r005) of the National University of Mexico, discussed the minimal inflammatory response that is associated with it; in fact, when considerable inflammatory reaction is present it is usually secondary to an accompanying bacterial infection or to necrosis. Amebiasis may involve any part of the intestine, but the cecum and ascending colon are most commonly affected. The entire colon is often diseased, giving rise to the term \"amebic ulcerative colitis.\" In parts of the world where amebiasis is endemic pathologists are aware that it may present with a wide variety of gross appearances and mimic many other lesions of the intestine, including idiopathic ulcerative colitis. Brandt and P\u00e9rez Tamayo mentioned that extension of amebiasis from the large intestine into the small bowel is almost always associated with severe colonic disease. The three most common complications are direct extension to the skin, perforation and dissemination. The frequency of perforation has ranged in different series from 1.5 to 21 per cent and was found at autopsy in nine of 190 cases of fatal amebic colitis (5 per cent) in the series from Mexico City.[5](#core-r005)What about the laboratory diagnosis of amebiasis? In this case multiple examinations of the stool failed to reveal the organisms. In a symposium on the subject Dr. George R. Healy,[6](#core-r006) chief of the Parasitology Service at the Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta, stated that although examination of bloody stools or aspiration of ulcers of the colon leads to recognition of the disorder in typical cases the diagnosis is often difficult. He stressed the fact that the parasitologist needs a different type of stool specimen for the diagnosis of amebiasis than that used for bacterial examination. Specifically, he recommended that in a suspected case of amebiasis \"a substantial portion\" of the entire stool be sent to the laboratory so that the microscopist can select the part of the specimen considered optimal for examination. All authors emphasize the value of experience in the diagnosis of amebiasis on the basis of stool examinations. Dr. Healy stated that \"If an examination of a fresh stool can be accomplished by a skilled microscopist within a period of one to two hours it is one of the best and most valuable types of examination.\" How many stool specimens must be examined before *E. histolytica* can be ruled out? Stamm[7](#core-r007) reported that 30 per cent of the identifications of amebae are made on the first examination, and an additional 45 to 65 per cent are made on the second and third examinations. The authors from the University of Mexico and the General Hospital in Mexico City,[5](#core-r005) where amebiasis ranks fourth as a cause of death, likewise emphasized that the identification of trophozoites in the stools constitutes positive diagnostic proof in the overwhelming majority of the cases. There has been increasing use of various immunologic diagnostic technics, which have proved helpful, but no authority believes that these methods should supplant a careful stool examination.Dr. Harvey B. Simon: It is a parasitologic aphorism that *E. histolytica* has been implicated in every intra-abdominal condition except pregnancy. As mentioned by Dr. Maynard and Dr. Vickery, the stool examination is central to the diagnosis of amebiasis. It must be remembered that many substances, including mineral oil, castor oil, antibiotics, sulfonamides and barium, interfere with a proper examination and should be avoided. Trophozoites, the invasive forms of the organism, are most likely to be found in diarrheal stools, but because the trophozoites are very labile the stool must be examined immediately. If an expert laboratory is not available the fresh stool can be preserved in polyvinyl alcohol and sent to a reference laboratory, such as the Center for Disease Control, for study. Cysts of *E. histolytica*, the infectious forms of the organism, are typically found in formed stools, but if the examination of formed stools is negative a saline purge may increase the yield. As mentioned by Dr. Maynard, direct examination of mucus from a colonic ulcer also has a high diagnostic yield. However, as noted, the development of serologic testing has been a major advance in the diagnosis of amebiasis. Indirect hemagglutination, complement fixation and agar-gel diffusion technics are available. The serologic examination is positive in only about 50 per cent of asymptomatic cyst passers, but in patients with invasive disease, such as colitis or amebic liver abscesses, the yield is greater than 90 per cent. Above all, it must be remembered that amebiasis is not a tropical disease but has a cosmopolitan distribution, so that a high index of suspicion is mandatory. An excellent review of the practical aspects of the diagnosis and management of amebiasis has just been published.[8](#core-r008)Dr. Bartlett: An abscess developed in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen during the first two weeks after the operation and was drained at a second procedure. The wound drained small-bowel contents, from which amebae were recovered. Sepsis was a continuing problem until the patient died, 2 1/2 months after the colectomy.Dr. Vickery: The post-mortem examination revealed a large perforation of the upper jejunum, which communicated with an extensive intra-abdominal abscess. No amebae could be demonstrated in the bowel wall or abscess cavity. There was an associated hepatitis, believed to be of toxic origin. No liver abscess was found.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Bronwen C. Carroll\n(Pediatrics): A 9-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of a generalized seizure and a bulging fontanelle.\nThe patient was reportedly well until 3 days before admission, when nasal congestion developed, and he was thought to have a low-grade fever. On the day of admission, two episodes of watery diarrhea occurred. His mother noted that his skin felt warm and the fontanelle was bulging. He was sleeping when jerking movements of the arms and legs began, lasting approximately 2 minutes, that were associated with fecal incontinence but no vomiting. After the seizure, he was limp, unresponsive, and apparently not breathing. Emergency medical services were called; on arrival, rapid spontaneous respirations were noted. The patient was transported by ambulance to another hospital. En route, generalized tonic\u2013clonic activity occurred, and diazepam was administered per rectum. Seizure activity abated for a few minutes and then recurred. He arrived in the emergency department approximately 40 minutes after the initial onset of seizure activity.\nOn examination, tonic\u2013clonic movements were present. The temperature was 39.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/52 mm Hg, the pulse 160 to 170 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 60 to 80 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation more than 95% while he was receiving 100% inspired oxygen by means of a nonrebreather mask. The patient was intermittently responsive to pain. The anterior fontanelle was large and bulging but not tense. The pupils were 2 mm in diameter and constricted slightly on exposure to illumination. There was conjugate gaze, and intermittently the eyes deviated to the left. There was green-liquid stool in the diaper. An analysis of arterial blood revealed a pH of 7.37, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 29 mm Hg (reference range, 35 to 45), a partial pressure of oxygen of 164 mm Hg (reference range, 70 to 95), and a bicarbonate level of 16 mmol per liter (reference range, 22 to 27). Urinalysis revealed a pH of 5.0, a urobilinogen level of 0.2 Ehrlich unit per deciliter, and rare white cells; the urine was positive for ketones (+), protein (+), and bacteria (3+) and was otherwise normal. Other laboratory-test results are shown in\nTable 1\nand\nTable 2\n. Lorazepam, fosphenytoin, and additional diazepam were administered; tonic\u2013clonic movements continued, with grunting and chest retractions. Fentanyl and rocuronium were administered, the trachea was intubated, and then ceftriaxone was administered. A bolus of normal saline with calcium gluconate was given intravenously. Seizure activity ceased. A chest radiograph revealed opacification in the right upper lobe, thought to represent atelectasis. Specimens of blood and stool were cultured. The patient was transferred to this hospital by helicopter. En route, calcium gluconate, fentanyl, and lorazepam were administered, and a nasogastric tube was inserted. No seizure activity was observed. The patient arrived approximately 3 hours after the onset of seizures.\nThe patient was born at 36 weeks of gestation; his parents had immigrated to the United States from East Africa 2 years earlier. At birth, the weight (3515 g), length (50.5 cm), and head circumference (35.5 cm) were at the 50th percentile; at 6 months, the weight (7.6 kg) and length (66 cm) remained at the 50th percentile. Results of newborn screening tests were normal, except for the presence of hemoglobins F, A, and S, consistent with sickle cell trait. The patient had met developmental milestones, including crawling, pulling himself to stand, speaking \u201cmama,\u201d and demonstrating adequate pincer grasp for his age. He was reported to have been exclusively breast-fed, with no vitamin supplementation, until approximately 3 weeks before admission, when breast-feeding was discontinued and milk-based formula reconstituted with water and rice cereal were begun. There was no recent trauma, unusual ingestion, travel, exposure to animals, or contact with sick persons. Liquid multivitamins had been prescribed; he had no allergies to medications. The child had attended well-child visits and received routine immunizations. He lived with his parents and four siblings and was cared for at home by his mother. There was no family history of seizures or other known hereditary disorders.\nOn examination, the patient was sedated, unresponsive, and intubated. The temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 113/58 mm Hg, the pulse 123 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, the length 71 cm (50th percentile), the estimated weight 8 kg (10th percentile), and the head circumference 48 cm (97th percentile). There was frontal bossing with no dysmorphic features; the fontanelles were wide open and full. There was a reducible umbilical hernia; the remainder of the examination was normal. An analysis of arterial blood revealed a pH of 7.29, a partial pressure of oxygen of 156 mm Hg, and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 36 mm Hg while the patient was breathing 40% inspired oxygen; other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. A central venous catheter was placed in the right femoral vein. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia but was otherwise normal. A chest radiograph revealed atelectasis of the right upper lobe and perihilar interstitial opacities.\nVancomycin, dexamethasone, acyclovir, ceftriaxone, calcium gluconate, fosphenytoin, midazolam, fentanyl, and ranitidine were administered, and a feeding tube was placed. A radiograph of the abdomen revealed mildly distended loops of small bowel, a gas-containing nondilated colon, and no evidence of bowel obstruction or masses. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain was normal.\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Michael F. Holick:* May we see the imaging studies?*Dr. Ruth Lim:* A chest radiograph ([Figure 1A](#f01)) revealed opacification of the right upper lobe, which could represent atelectasis or aspiration in the context of a seizure. Mild perihilar interstitial opacities could be the result of low lung volumes or mild inflammation of the airways. An abdominal radiograph revealed loops of bowel that were distended with gas, without evidence of bowel obstruction or mass. CT of the head showed no evidence of hydrocephalus, intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion, or increased intracranial pressure; a three-dimensional CT surface reconstruction of the skull ([Figure 1B](#f01)) revealed an enlarged anterior fontanelle and frontal bossing ([Figure 1C, arrow](#f01)).*Dr. Holick:* This 9-month-old breast-fed infant presented with a seizure after a few days of nasal congestion, diarrhea, and possible fever. Examination showed a bulging fontanelle and frontal bossing, and the results of laboratory tests showed hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. To arrive at a diagnosis, we need to consider the causes of seizures and the consequences of breast-feeding without vitamin supplementation.\n### Seizures\n\nThe immediate concern regarding this child with seizures is infectious meningitis or encephalitis or both. Other considerations include tumor, bleeding in the brain, toxins, pyridoxine dependency, and phenylketonuria, among others. A child with seizures should also be evaluated for the presence of metabolic disturbances, such as hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypoxia, and hypocalcemia.\n### Hypocalcemia\n\nThis child had marked hypocalcemia, which could have caused his seizure. Clinical signs of hypocalcemia, including fatigue, anxiety, and muscle cramps, may be subtle and not appreciated until tetany, seizures, or laryngeal spasms occur. Hypocalcemia has numerous causes. Since the child was normal at birth and met milestones in growth and muscle function, genetic causes such as the DiGeorge syndrome are unlikely. Acute, severe illness with sepsis, pancreatitis, osteopetrosis, or tumor metastases can cause hypocalcemia but is unlikely in this case. Rickets and the hungry bone syndrome (rapid mineralization of unmineralized osteoid that is \u201chungry\u201d for calcium hydroxyapatite) are rare causes of hypocalcemia that merit consideration.\n### Bulging Fontanelle and Cranial Bossing\n\nThe differential diagnosis of a bulging fontanelle is extensive and includes increased intracranial pressure from a variety of causes, such as intracranial infection.[1](#core-r001) However, widened fontanelles and a thin skull that is soft and parchmentlike (craniotabes) are early manifestations (in the third and fourth months) of rickets.[2](#core-r002) This child also had frontal cranial bossing (thickening of the vault), which is due to new bone formation derived almost entirely from the periosteum, on the outer surface of the skull; it also has many causes, including achondroplasia, Hurler's syndrome, congenital syphilis, and rickets.[3](#core-r003)\n### Nutritional Deficiencies\n\nThis child received breast milk as his primary source of nutrition for almost 9 months. This can result in several nutritional deficiencies, such as deficiencies in iron and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and K. [4](#core-r004)The mother is of African descent, and the presence of dark skin puts her at risk for vitamin D deficiency, and thus increases the breast-fed child's risk of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency manifesting as rickets is resurgent in the United States in recent years, particularly in infants who are solely breast-fed.[5,6](#core-r005) There is essentially no vitamin D in human breast milk (approximately 25 IU per liter).[7](#core-r007) This child's mother would have needed to ingest at least 2000 to 4000 IU of vitamin D per day in order to transfer enough of the vitamin in her milk to satisfy the infant's requirement.[7,8](#core-r007)The signs and symptoms of early vitamin D deficiency are often missed ([Table 3](#t03)). Restlessness and irritability are common and nonspecific, but sweating on the head is a distinctive feature. Vitamin D deficiency causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, resulting in removal of calcium from the skeleton to maintain a normal serum calcium level. It also causes hypophosphatemia due to loss of phosphorus in the urine, which leads to decreased mineralization of bone. This child has skeletal abnormalities, including craniotabes, frontal bossing, and wide-open fontanelles. Other skeletal signs of osteomalacia do not begin to appear until 6 to 9 months of age. Vitamin D deficiency also disturbs maturation of chondrocytes, resulting in widened epiphyseal plates of the long bones and the costochondral junctions. When a child with vitamin D deficiency begins to stand, gravity leads to bowing of the legs. Teething is delayed, and muscle weakness may occur. This child had a respiratory infection; children with rickets have more frequent upper respiratory tract infections than do normal children.[9](#core-r009) He had anemia; children with severe vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism can have anemia due to fibrosis of the marrow space (the von Jacksch\u2013Luzet syndrome). Compensatory extramedullary production of red cells in the liver and spleen may cause hepatosplenomegaly, which he did not have.There is also very little iron in breast milk, and this child had anemia. In one study, children between 6 and 24 months of age who were solely breast-fed for 6 months had an incidence of iron deficiency anemia that was three to five times as great as the incidence among children who were not solely breast-fed.[4](#core-r004) Although iron is more bioavailable in human breast milk than in fortified formula, the amount of iron is very low (35 to 40 \u03bcg per deciliter).This child also had hyperchloremic acidosis with glycosuria. Primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism cause a decrease in bicarbonate reabsorption in the kidneys, which can lead to hyperchloremic acidosis, glycosuria, and aminoaciduria \u2014 a condition known as Fanconi's syndrome.[9](#core-r009) Although renal tubular acidosis, type II, cannot be ruled out, the more likely cause for the metabolic acidosis is secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with vitamin D deficiency. Hyperglycemia was probably caused by stress, and the presence of ketones in the urine was probably a result of the seizure activity, as well as carpopedal spasms, which may have occurred for weeks before his admission to the hospital.\n### Rickets\n\nVitamin D\u2013deficiency rickets is the most likely cause of the infant's presenting symptoms and abnormal biochemical studies. However, there are several syndromes that need consideration in the differential diagnosis of this child with severe hypocalcemia and skeletal evidence of rickets.Pseudo\u2013vitamin D\u2013deficiency rickets is caused by a mutation in the gene for renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1\u03b1-hydroxylase, leading to reduced levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Vitamin D\u2013resistant rickets, caused by a mutation of the vitamin D receptor, leads to markedly elevated levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; children may have alopecia totalis, which was not observed in this child. Children with vitamin D\u2013dependent rickets type III have an excess production of heterologous nuclear binding protein that prevents 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D from interacting with its vitamin D receptor. They also have elevated levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Thus, measurement of the serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level would be helpful in ruling out these causes.[8](#core-r008)Acquired and inherited disorders of phosphate metabolism are known as hypophosphatemic rickets or osteomalacia and include autosomal dominant and X-linked inherited hypophosphatemic rickets and oncogenic osteomalacia due to the overproduction of fibroblast growth factor 23 and phosphatonins by a tumor. Patients have normal serum calcium levels but markedly low serum phosphorus levels. This child's serum phosphorus level was low, but not as low as would be expected for hypophosphatemic rickets, and he had a low serum calcium level. Increased production of fibroblast growth factor 23 and phosphatonins inhibits renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and as a result, the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels are low or undetectable, which helps in making the diagnosis.[8](#core-r008)\n### Rickets and Hypocalcemia\n\nWhy did severe hypocalcemia develop in this child? Possible causes include the upper respiratory tract infection and diarrhea, but a more likely cause is the recent addition of milk-based formula and treatment with a multivitamin that presumably contained vitamin D. The milk-based formula contains high levels of phosphate, which could result in a normal calcium-phosphate product, and, together with the addition of vitamin D, could result in the hungry bone syndrome, producing hypocalcemia.\n### Summary\n\nThis 9-month-old, breast-fed child's frontal bossing and craniotabes, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase level, metabolic acidosis, and seizure are all consistent with rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency. I expect that the diagnostic test was the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. There may have been radiologic signs of rickets, in addition to the frontal bossing, but these signs may not be apparent in a patient at 9 months of age.Immediate treatment may require a total of 200,000 to 600,000 IU of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) or vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) either orally or parenterally. Other treatments that have been reported to be effective are 1700 to 4000 IU of vitamin D per day for 10 weeks or 2000 to 4000 IU per day for 3 to 6 months. Infantile vitamin D intoxication is essentially unknown, unless there is either intentional or inadvertent vitamin D poisoning. For prevention of various manifestations of vitamin D deficiency, which include not only rickets but also increased frequency of respiratory illnesses,[10](#core-r010) diabetes mellitus,[11](#core-r011) and wheezing illnesses,[12](#core-r012) the American Academy of Pediatrics has changed its recommendation from 200 IU of vitamin D to 400 IU daily in drops or tablets from birth through adolescence, which is in line with the recommendation of the Canadian Pediatric Society. [13\u201316](#core-r013)*Dr. Eric S. Rosenberg* (Pathology): Dr. Sherry, what was your clinical impression?*Dr. Nicole A. Sherry* (Pediatric Endocrinology): For many of the reasons that Dr. Holick discussed, we also thought that vitamin D deficiency was the most likely diagnosis. We also considered hypoparathyroidism, a relatively common cause of hypocalcemia in this age group. However, in hypoparathyroidism, the phosphate level is usually normal to slightly elevated, whereas in vitamin D deficiency the serum phosphate level is low because of the phosphaturic effect of parathyroid hormone.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Anand S. Dighe:* The diagnostic test was a measurement of the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, which was low, at 16 ng per milliliter (\u201cdesirable\u201d reference range, >32). Although 25-hydroxyvitamin D is largely inactive, its levels correlate with clinical markers of the action of vitamin D, such as enhanced intestinal absorption of calcium, enhanced bone density, and the avoidance of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The parathyroid hormone level, measured at a time when the patient was hypocalcemic, was elevated (264 pg per milliliter; reference range, 10 to 60), demonstrating that the patient's calcium-parathyroid axis was functioning appropriately (Figure 1 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP3604398DC1), available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).The 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level, measured at a time when the patient was hypocalcemic, was elevated at 98 pg per milliliter. The half-life of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is short (4 to 6 hours) and the level may be reduced, normal, or elevated in cases of vitamin D deficiency, depending on the activity of the 1\u03b1-hydroxylase that converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which in turn depends on the current blood concentrations of calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone. In this patient with elevated parathyroid hormone activity, the 1\u03b1-hydroxylase was activated, resulting in elevated levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, despite clinically significant vitamin D deficiency. This case points out that measuring the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) lacks utility in the routine evaluation of suspected vitamin D deficiency. Testing for this form of vitamin D should be reserved for patients with suspected genetic rickets and for more complex presentations.Additional laboratory studies suggested a global nutritional deficiency. The serum vitamin A level was low at 7 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 11.3 to 64.7). The patient also had a mildly elevated prothrombin time ([Table 1](#t01)) that returned to normal 2 days after the administration of oral vitamin K. He had a microcytic anemia suggestive of iron deficiency ([Table 1](#t01)), with a low mean corpuscular volume, anisocytosis, hypochromia, and an elevated red-cell distribution width. The hemoglobin electrophoresis showed sickle cell trait with a reduced percentage of hemoglobin S of 34.8% (typically approximately 40% with uncomplicated sickle cell trait), consistent with concomitant iron deficiency, \u03b1-thalassemia, or both. The transferrin saturation (calculated as the serum iron level divided by the total iron-binding capacity) was low at 4.9%, confirming the diagnosis of iron deficiency.The patient also had an absolute lymphopenia and a slightly low globulin level ([Table 2](#t02)). Flow cytometric analysis of blood lymphocytes showed only mild decreases in the number of T cells, and immunoglobulin levels were normal. Although there is no specific explanation for these abnormalities, a variety of vitamins and trace minerals, as well as sufficient calories from protein, are important for optimal functioning of the immune system. The lymphopenia resolved after nutritional needs were met.*Dr. Lim:* A follow-up chest radiograph on the second hospital day ([Figure 2A](#f02)) showed improved lung aeration. In addition, there was generalized demineralization of bone. Diffuse demineralization, cortical thinning, and trabecular coarsening are characteristic of vitamin D\u2013deficiency rickets. There was physeal widening and metaphyseal irregularity of the proximal humeri and enlarged lower anterior rib ends. This flared, bulbous appearance of the rib ends, resembling a chain of beads (termed \u201crachitic rosary\u201d), is characteristic of rickets.[17](#core-r017) In retrospect, these abnormalities were present on the initial chest radiograph ([Figure 1A](#f01)).Radiographs of the left wrist performed the next day ([Figure 2B and 2C](#f02)) revealed demineralization with irregular fraying, flaring, and cupping of the distal radius and ulna. There was physeal widening, with increased distance between the distal radial epiphysis and the metaphysis. There was mild bowing deformity and smooth periosteal reaction along the ulna. A transverse linear radiolucency (termed \u201cLooser zone\u201d) with more focal periosteal reaction was seen in the proximal ulnar diaphysis.These are characteristic radiographic manifestations of vitamin D\u2013deficiency rickets that become apparent several weeks after biochemical and histologic changes can be detected. The osseous abnormalities first occur at the rapidly growing ends of long bones. Irregular fraying of the metaphysis causes the end of the bone to become radiolucent and indistinguishable from the adjacent physis, leading to an apparent increase in the distance between the epiphysis and metaphysis, often with flaring and cupping of the metaphyseal ends. Skull findings include frontal bossing, as in this case, and enlargement and delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle.[1,18](#core-r001)\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Sherry:* Calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D), ergocalciferol, and calcium carbonate were administered for 2 weeks, and the serum calcium level returned to normal (Figure 2 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP3604398DC1)). Although calcitriol does not correct the underlying deficiency, the onset of its action is faster than that of ergocalciferol (hours vs. days), and it was used in this case in an attempt to normalize the serum calcium level quickly. The patient also received multivitamin drops, ferrous sulfate, oral sodium phosphate, vitamin E, and vitamin K to correct the other deficiencies. Evaluation by an infectious-disease consultant revealed positive antigen tests for rotavirus in the stool. An analysis of cerebrospinal fluid was normal, except for an elevated glucose level, and cultures and a polymerase-chain-reaction assay were negative for microorganisms; a test for the human immunodeficiency virus was negative. After 2 weeks, the patient was transferred to a children's hospital affiliated with this hospital and was discharged from there 1 week later.On discharge, a streamlined medication plan, developed at his mother's request to avoid multiple doses of medications throughout the day, included calcium carbonate three times daily and ergocalciferol (50,000 IU orally) weekly. After discharge, the mother did not keep appointments at the endocrine clinic. Ergocalciferol was discontinued after 3 weeks, and oral polyvitamin drops were continued (400 IU of vitamin D per day) by the child's pediatrician. Five months after discharge, the patient's 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was low at 12.7 ng per milliliter. We recommended vitamin D by means of injection, followed by 800 IU daily thereafter, but the patient did not return for follow-up. When we finally saw him again 11 months after admission, he was developing normally, and the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 26 ng per milliliter. He was taking only a multivitamin, and we again prescribed ergocalciferol (1600 IU) daily.*Dr. Holick:* If one gives vitamin D (D2 or D3) to a vitamin D\u2013deficient infant, it will quickly be converted to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). Calcitriol enhances the 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase (CYP24R) activity and increases degradation of both 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which is why I prefer not to use it.[15](#core-r015)\n",

      "question": "Dr. Jenica N. Upshaw\n(Medicine): An 81-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of cough, weight loss, odynophagia, and failure to thrive.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health, with diabetes mellitus, until approximately 15 months earlier, when intermittent cough developed and he gradually began to lose weight. Seven months before admission, he lost his job, after which his oral intake decreased and his family noted that he appeared depressed and slept most of each day. During the next 2 months, his cough increased and was productive of dark-yellow sputum. Five months before the current admission, he was admitted to this hospital because of episodes of dizziness and falling associated with hypoglycemia and dehydration.\nAt that time, the patient reported weight loss of approximately 23 kg during the previous year. He had had type 2 diabetes mellitus for more than 20 years and had been admitted to this hospital for the first time 9 months earlier for an episode of hypoglycemia, which responded to the administration of intravenous glucose and adjustment of his insulin dose. He had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, and thyroid nodules. He had been given a diagnosis of pulmonary asbestosis and had a history of exposure to asbestos from his work in a shipyard during his teens, characterized by pleural plaques and pulmonary fibrosis, which had been asymptomatic. He had no known allergies to medications. Medications on admission included insulin, aspirin, valsartan, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and a multivitamin. He was born and raised in an urban area in Massachusetts, lived with his wife, and had worked in sales. He had smoked heavily until the diagnosis of diabetes; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. A son had died from lymphoma at 51 years of age.\nOn examination 5 months before the current admission, the patient was thin, with temporal wasting, and appeared tired. The weight was 58.4 kg, the temperature 35.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 113/56 mm Hg, the pulse 61 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while he was breathing 2 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. The mucous membranes were dry, the tongue had a white coating, and jugular venous pulsations measured 1 cm of water. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard throughout the precordium, and there were dry crackles at the bases of the lungs, with no dullness, wheezes, or rhonchi. The fingernails and toenails were long and soiled; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. A chest radiograph revealed pleural calcifications and plaques and diffuse, bilateral peripheral reticular opacities, more prominent in the lower lobes. These features were thought to be consistent with asbestosis and pulmonary fibrosis and were unchanged from previous examinations. Electrocardiographic findings were normal. Intravenous fluids and glucose, subcutaneous heparin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin were administered, and the dose of insulin was adjusted. Valsartan was stopped, and the other medications were continued.\nOn the third day, hypoxemia and hypotension developed. Arterial blood gas analysis while the patient was breathing 100% oxygen showed a pH of 7.38; the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 35 mm Hg, and the partial pressure of oxygen 72 mm Hg. A chest radiograph showed new bilateral pulmonary opacities, which were thought to represent multifocal pneumonia or edema. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after the administration of contrast material showed multiple patchy ground-glass opacities and consolidation in gravity-dependent areas of the lungs and mild pulmonary edema. The CT scans also showed chronic lung and pleural changes that were consistent with asbestosis, thyroid nodules, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, all of which had been present on previous examinations. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibacterial agents and continuous positive airway pressure was given and led to improvement. Despite an extensive evaluation, no pathogen was identified. During this hospitalization, intermittent episodes of hypoxemia occurred that were self-limiting. Combined positron-emission tomography and CT, with\n18\nF-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed pleural plaques, calcifications, and other changes consistent with asbestosis but no evidence of abnormal FDG uptake. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility after 17 days. Approximately 2 months before this admission, he was discharged to his home from the rehabilitation facility.\nWhile at home, the patient did not resume his previous activities. His family noted a progressive decline in his appetite and increasing weakness and brought him to the emergency department. He stated that his weight had been approximately 84 kg before this illness. He reported anorexia and difficulty swallowing solids but not liquids or soft foods, with frequent regurgitation and episodes of food sticking in his throat; he pointed to a site of obstruction in his throat. On examination, he appeared cachectic. The weight was 49.6 kg, the temperature 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 87/45 mm Hg, the pulse 69 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry, white plaques were present on the oral mucosa, skin turgor was decreased, and there were crackles at both lung bases. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory-test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. A chest radiograph was unchanged. Intravenous fluids were administered. Oral nystatin was begun, and he was admitted.\nA barium-swallow examination showed a normal swallowing mechanism; an abnormal mucosal pattern of the esophagus, with multiple reticulations and a cobblestone appearance; and longitudinal muscular hypertrophy. Later that day, upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination was attempted but was obscured by barium. On the fourth day, CT of the neck and thorax after the administration of contrast material revealed a hypodensity in the right thyroid gland, a mildly patulous oropharynx and hypopharynx, thickening and irregularity of the esophagus, right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy up to 2.1 cm in diameter, multiple small and low-attenuation lesions in the liver, perihepatic ascites, and circumferential thickening of the gallbladder wall.\nThe next day, the temperature rose to 38.0\u00b0C. Specimens of blood, urine, and sputum were cultured. On the sixth day, esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed diffuse white esophageal plaques. The administration of fluconazole was begun. The following day, the temperature rose to 38.4\u00b0C and the weight was 52.6 kg. Ultrasonography of the thyroid revealed a multinodular gland. On the ninth hospital day, CT of the abdomen revealed the pleural findings seen previously, at least four solid hepatic lesions (up to 2.9 cm in diameter), and hypodensities in segment 8 that were thought to represent thrombosed intrahepatic branches of the right portal vein. There was no free air or fluid or abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Valerie E. Stone:* May we review the radiologic studies?*Dr. Victorine V. Muse:* The chest radiographs and CT scans of the chest obtained during the previous admission showed bilateral calcified pleural plaques, pulmonary fibrosis thought to be secondary to asbestosis, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, all of which had been present and unchanged for at least 1 year. Abdominal and pelvic CT scans showed no abnormalities at that time.The chest radiograph on the current admission showed progressive lower-lobe consolidation and ground-glass opacities superimposed on the previously described findings. A repeat CT scan of the chest on this admission ([Figure 1A](#f01)) showed no change in the findings in the chest but disclosed multiple low-attenuation lesions throughout the liver that had not been present previously and were confirmed on CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis ([Figure 1B](#f01)).A barium-swallow examination performed during this admission revealed a diffuse mucosal abnormality, with a cobblestone pattern and thickening of the wall that suggested muscular hypertrophy ([Figure 2A](#f02)). Severe dysmotility was noted.*Dr. Stone:* This elderly man with a history of asbestos exposure, heavy smoking, and diabetes mellitus presented with fatigue, weight loss, malaise, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary infiltrates superimposed on pleural-based abnormalities that had remained stable for a period of 9 to 15 months. The current admission was prompted by the recent onset of fevers, failure to thrive, and odynophagia; evidence of oral and esophageal candidiasis was found, and multiple lesions in the liver were seen on CT imaging.This patient is typical of many elderly patients with complex medical issues that may culminate in a presentation characterized by nonspecific findings such as failure to thrive. This patient had several long-standing conditions, including diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive lung disease, asbestosis, and depression. Any of these conditions individually or in combination may be responsible for his current illness, and it is difficult to determine the relative contribution of each of these chronic conditions to his acute presentation.In view of this patient's long history of smoking, known exposure to asbestos, and chronic obstructive lung disease, we must consider the possibility of a primary pulmonary process, especially lung cancer, as the cause of his illness. This patient is at risk for a smoking-related malignant condition, including the development of a tumor, or pulmonary disease because of his exposure to asbestos. Although lung cancer is common in the elderly and this patient has multiple risk factors for the development of lung cancer, the lack of a discrete mass or nodule on imaging studies lessens the likelihood of this diagnosis. He is also at risk for mesothelioma, but this is not likely because of the absence of a new pleural-based mass. Finally, his long, slow course is not consistent with most malignant tumors, and neither lung cancer nor mesothelioma would cause an immunocompromised state that would predispose him to thrush or esophageal candidiasis. In fact, only a hematologic cancer, immunosuppressive medication, or infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) could explain this apparent immunocompromise.[1](#core-r001)This patient is 81 years of age and has long-standing diabetes and recurrent episodes of congestive heart failure. Ischemia and myocardial dysfunction resulting in heart failure could be a subtle contributor to his generalized malaise, weight loss, and failure to thrive. Although cardiac disease is common in the elderly, this patient had a normal electrocardiogram and normal cardiac markers, making this diagnosis unlikely.What about a primary psychiatric process? Major depression is common in the elderly, and often the presentation of depression may be more subtle than in young patients. We are told that this patient appeared depressed and had cognitive decline. Weight loss, poor hygiene, and failure to thrive may be indicative of an episode of major depression. Although I cannot dismiss the possibility that this patient was depressed, many features of this case cannot be explained by depression alone. Specifically, we need an explanation for his oral candidiasis, pneumonia, and liver lesions.HIV infection could tie together many of the features of this case. There are several reasons why I suspect that this patient has advanced HIV infection. First, although thrush can be seen in elderly patients with dentures, in patients with diabetes mellitus, and in patients who use corticosteroid inhalers, the vast majority of patients with thrush have HIV infection. [1,2](#core-r001) Because of the patient's difficulty swallowing, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. May we review the endoscopy findings?*Dr. Brenna C. Bounds:* Endoscopic examination of the esophagus ([Figure 2B](#f02)) revealed extensive, confluent white plaques throughout its length, with a cobblestone appearance, which is diagnostic of esophageal candidiasis. The appearance of muscular hypertrophy seen on barium swallow ([Figure 2A](#f02)) was in fact large numbers of candida plaques that were present all the way from the mouth to the esophagogastric junction.*Dr. Stone:* The progression of thrush to esophageal candidiasis is essentially diagnostic of HIV disease.[3,4](#core-r003) More than 90% of patients with esophageal candidiasis have HIV.[5](#core-r005) It is the second most common acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\u2013defining opportunistic infection, and those with this diagnosis usually have CD4 cell counts of less than 100 per cubic millimeter.[6](#core-r006) Esophageal candidiasis is seen in very few diseases besides HIV disease \u2014 essentially, it is seen only in patients who are given corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy, or other immunosuppressive agents.[7](#core-r007) In addition, this patient has a constellation of other signs and symptoms that are highly suggestive of HIV disease: loss of more than 10% of body weight, cognitive decline, malaise and fatigue, lymphadenopathy, apparent recurrent bacterial pneumonias, and pancytopenia.In my experience, many clinicians are reluctant to consider the diagnosis of HIV infection in elderly adults, because we typically think of HIV as a disease of younger people. However, HIV is becoming more common in older adults, and the average age of AIDS-related death in this country is rising.[8](#core-r008) The observed increase in the prevalence and incidence of HIV in adults older than 50 years is due to both the longevity of the HIV epidemic and an increase in new infections in older persons.[9,10](#core-r009) Persons older than 50 years who are at risk for HIV infection are less likely to seek HIV testing than are younger patients,[11\u201315](#core-r011) and physicians often confuse symptoms of HIV infection with so-called normal aging.[15](#core-r015) These factors often lead to a delay in the diagnosis of HIV infection in older persons. This delay in diagnosis has been documented to lead to a much higher rate of AIDS at the time of diagnosis and death within 1 month after the initial HIV diagnosis than the rates among younger persons.[11,15,16](#core-r011) Contributing to the delay in diagnosis is the mistaken belief of many physicians that older people are unlikely to be sexually active and unlikely to be at risk for HIV because of other behaviors, such as injection-drug use. However, many elderly people are sexually active.[17](#core-r017)If we assume that this patient has AIDS, what could be causing new liver lesions and fever? The differential diagnosis includes both infectious and malignant processes. The infectious processes include disseminated infections such as tuberculosis,[18\u201323](#core-r018) histoplasmosis,[24,25](#core-r024) and *Mycobacterium avium* complex.[26\u201330](#core-r026) The malignant processes include Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Kaposi's sarcoma is unlikely in this case because of the absence of characteristic skin lesions.Although tuberculosis is the most common cause of fever of unknown origin in patients with HIV infection,[26,27,30](#core-r026) it is less likely in this patient than is lymphoma, in view of the lack of evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis and the absence of abdominal lymphadenopathy.[22](#core-r022) The risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas is increased by a factor of 110 in persons with HIV infection, and this disease is therefore the most likely diagnosis in this patient because of the evidence suggesting that he has advanced HIV disease.[31](#core-r031) The presentation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma varies, but many patients have systemic symptoms, such as weight loss, fever, or night sweats, as this patient had. In fact, lymphoma is the second most common cause of fever of unknown origin in patients with HIV infection. Hodgkin's lymphoma is also possible but is less likely than non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, because of the lower frequency with which Hodgkin's lymphoma occurs in patients with advanced HIV infection and because it is most often based in the lymph nodes and less often presents in non-nodal sites such as the liver.I believe this patient has both advanced AIDS and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, it is important to keep in mind that patients with AIDS often have multiple concurrent opportunistic infections or diseases. The diagnoses of esophageal candidiasis and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma do not guarantee that the patient has no other diagnoses. His hypoxemia, chronic cough, and pulmonary radiologic findings may be due to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma[32](#core-r032) but could also be due to another process such as infection.[33\u201336](#core-r033) Thus, it would be prudent to evaluate the patient for a pulmonary infection.[37](#core-r037)Other diagnostic studies are recommended. These are an HIV-antibody test, a liver biopsy (CT-guided) to evaluate the patient for liver lesions, and analysis of induced sputum for detection of *Pneumocystis jiroveci.**Dr. Eric S. Rosenberg* (Medicine and Pathology): Dr. Robbins, will you give us your impressions at the time you saw this patient?*Dr. Gregory K. Robbins* (Medicine): Our thinking was similar to that of Dr. Stone. We obtained written informed consent from both the patient and his family for antibody testing for HIV; this was performed and was positive. The CD4+ T-cell count was 13 cells per cubic millimeter and the plasma level of HIV RNA (the viral load) was more than 1 million copies per milliliter. This confirmed the diagnosis of advanced HIV infection.We began treatment with oral fluconazole for the esophageal candidiasis, with rapid resolution of the patient's odynophagia. We were also concerned about the possibility of additional opportunistic infections. An induced sputum specimen was positive for the presence of *P. jiroveci,* and we started treatment with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and prednisone because he had an elevated alveolar\u2013arterial oxygen gradient, at 87 mm Hg. Testing of the blood for cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia showed eight positive cells on two slides, indicating low-level reactivation of CMV. An ophthalmologic evaluation showed no evidence of acute retinitis, and we opted not to treat the CMV infection at that time. We initiated azithromycin for the treatment of presumed *M. avium* complex, and we initiated early antiretroviral therapy with stavudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz. We also recommended a liver biopsy.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Judith A. Ferry:* Fine-needle aspiration and core biopsy of the liver were performed; small cores of tissue and fluid for cytologic evaluation were obtained. The tissue cores ([Figure 3A](#f03)) showed areas of a tumor composed of medium-size cells with oval nuclei, distinct nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm, features consistent with large lymphoid cells ([Figure 3B](#f03)). Immunostaining showed that the cells were positive for the leukocyte common antigen (CD45), the pan\u2013B-cell marker (CD20) ([Figure 3C](#f03)), and Bcl-2 and negative for CD5 and CD10. Approximately 90% of the cells were positive for Ki67, indicating a rapidly proliferating tumor. In situ hybridization for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) RNA was negative. The pathological diagnosis was diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma occurring in a patient with HIV/AIDS.Diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas in HIV-positive patients, particularly those with severe immunodeficiency, such as this patient, are EBV-positive in 70 to 80% of cases,[38](#core-r038) and uncontrolled EBV infection due to loss of T-cell surveillance is thought to be important in their pathogenesis. The pathogenesis of EBV-negative lymphomas such as this one is not known. Cases of lymphoma with involvement of the liver in patients with widespread disease or at the time of relapse are more common than are cases of primary hepatic lymphoma.[39,40](#core-r039) There was no evidence of bone marrow, peripheral-blood, or cerebrospinal fluid involvement.*Dr. Rosenberg:* Dr. Abramson, how did you manage this patient's lymphoma?*Dr. Jeremy S. Abramson* (Medical Oncology): The prognosis of AIDS-related lymphomas has improved since the availability of effective antiviral therapy, but this patient presented with multiple poor prognostic features including advanced age, advanced stage, poor performance status, and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level.[41,42](#core-r041) In HIV-infected patients, a very low CD4 cell count is an additional risk factor for poor outcome. [43,44](#core-r043) Although diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is curable, in this patient we thought that full-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy would be likely to result in treatment-related death. We were encouraged that the extent of the disease was relatively limited and that the patient was largely asymptomatic from the lymphoma. In view of the multiple opportunistic infections, we recommended a period of immune reconstitution and antimicrobial therapy to improve the patient's performance status, after which our goal was to initiate combination chemotherapy with curative intent.*Dr. Rosenberg:* Dr. Upshaw, can you tell us what happened?*Dr. Upshaw*: The patient was discharged on hospital day 28. Several weeks later he was readmitted with leukocytosis, confusion, failure to thrive, and presumed aspiration pneumonia. A feeding tube was placed in the hope that optimization of his nutritional state would improve his functional status. However, his mental status continued to deteriorate, and he was no longer considered to be a candidate for chemotherapy. After discussions with the family, it was decided to make his transition into comfort care. He died several days later, about 10 weeks after the initial diagnosis of HIV infection.*Dr. Ferry:* At postmortem examination, firm, white hyaline plaques were identified on the parietal pleura of the chest wall and on the diaphragmatic pleura, features consistent with asbestos exposure. There was acute, bilateral bronchopneumonia superimposed on interstitial fibrosis that was consistent with asbestosis-related lung disease. Enlarged mediastinal and pulmonary hilar lymph nodes showed reactive changes and a single caseating granuloma that contained no organisms but did contain particles consistent with silica. The esophagus appeared normal, with no evidence of candidiasis. There were the classic lesions of the Kimmelstiel\u2013Wilson syndrome, features consistent with the patient's history of diabetes mellitus, moderate coronary artery disease, focal myocardial fibrosis, and atherosclerosis of the aorta and major arteries. The liver showed extensive involvement of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma ([Figure 4](#f04)). No spread of tumor beyond the liver was identified. Neuropathological evaluation revealed changes related to Alzheimer's disease: Braak and Braak stage IV of VI neurofibrillary tangles and sparse neuritic plaques. There was no evidence of changes associated with HIV encephalopathy.This case is an example of primary hepatic lymphoma \u2014 a rare presentation of lymphoma that mainly affects middle-aged or older men, such as our patient.[45\u201347](#core-r045) The majority of primary hepatic lymphomas are diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas, as in this case, and as many as 40% of patients with primary hepatic lymphoma have an underlying immunologic abnormality, including immunodeficiency due to HIV, as in this case. Primary hepatic lymphoma has also been associated with infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus and long-standing chronic inflammation due to tuberculosis.[46,48\u201350](#core-r046)*Dr. Rochelle Walensky* (Medicine): Although this patient had used the health care system many times, the diagnosis of HIV infection was made at a very late stage. Impediments to early diagnosis of HIV infection in the elderly include both a low index of suspicion on the part of caregivers and a requirement for written informed consent. Since 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended routine screening for HIV infection for patients 13 to 64 years of age.[51](#core-r051) Additional studies have shown that it is cost-effective to routinely screen for HIV infection in patients up to 75 years of age.[52](#core-r052) As this case illustrates, even advanced age does not eliminate the possibility of HIV infection. The CDC guidelines also recommend allowing oral, opt-out consent for HIV testing, rather than written, opt-in consent.[53](#core-r053) As of mid-2009, only a handful of states, including Massachusetts, still require written informed consent.*A Physician:* In the emergency room, we do not routinely perform HIV testing because there is no adequate mechanism for result reporting and patient follow-up.*Dr. Walensky:* The rapid, point-of-care HIV test can provide preliminary results in 20 minutes, during the same clinical encounter, and has allowed for expanded testing in emergency departments and urgent care facilities.*A Physician:* In retrospect, was it possible to determine how the patient acquired HIV infection?*Dr. Robbins:* Both the patient and his family were questioned about risk factors for HIV infection on many occasions during his hospitalizations, and none were acknowledged. He could have acquired the infection many years earlier, and we do not know what his risk factors might have been then.*Dr. Nesli Basgoz* (Medicine): Although there was no evidence that he engaged in high-risk behaviors, it is important to remember that anyone who has been sexually active has at least one risk factor for HIV infection.\n",

      "question": "A 26-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of persistent fever, with diarrhea, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoxemia.\nThe patient was well until approximately four weeks earlier, when nausea, headache, myalgia, and watery diarrhea developed, and her temperature rose as high as 40\u00b0C. After symptoms of four days' duration she consulted a physician, who made a diagnosis of a \"viral syndrome\" and prescribed symptomatic treatment. Fever and diarrhea persisted, and vomiting occurred, with a sore throat and enlarged, tender cervical lymph nodes. Twenty days before admission she returned to her physician, who found that the temperature was 40.3\u00b0C. She was admitted to another hospital.\nThe patient resided in a house trailer with her family, in an area where mosquitoes and ticks were abundant and the drinking water often had an unpleasant odor and taste. Her son, 12 months old, had an undiagnosed illness four months earlier, characterized by fever and diarrhea for several days. Two months before entry the patient had a miscarriage at home of a two-month or three-month fetus, without medical attention or follow-up examinations. Three weeks before admission she was bitten on the hand by a rabbit at a farm fair. One week before entry she ate eggs in a restaurant where 13 persons contracted salmonella infection on the same day from consuming eggs. On the same day she was found to have a dental infection, and she took oral penicillin intermittently over the succeeding five days. The patient's husband had used illicit drugs by vein in the past. Two adult cats, one of which had just delivered a litter, shared the patient's home; both cats were well, although the kittens had died. There was no history of recent travel, recent exposure to infected persons, use of medications other than penicillin, receipt of blood transfusions, personal abuse of illicit drugs, or recent cat scratches or bites by ticks, rats, or bats. The patient denied having sexual partners other than her husband; he and their two children were currently well.\nPhysical examination on entry to the other hospital showed that the temperature was 40\u00b0C. Tenderness was elicited over the gum in the right lower molar area. The neck was supple, and there was tenderness in the right submandibular region. The lungs were clear, and the heart was normal. The abdomen was normal except for an increase in bowel sounds; no tenderness was noted.\nThe urine was normal except that the sediment contained 15 white cells and small numbers of bacteria per high-power field. The hematocrit was 42.7 percent; the white-cell count was 3700, with 59 percent neutrophils, 11 percent band forms, 24 percent lymphocytes, and 6 percent monocytes. The platelet count was 196,000, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 43 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 6.4 mmol per liter (18 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 5.4 mmol per liter (97 mg per 100 ml), the bilirubin 3.42 \u03bcmol per liter (0.2 mg per 100 ml), the cholesterol 1.9 mmol per liter (73 mg per 100 ml), the triglyceride 1.30 mmol per liter (115 mg per 100 ml), the uric acid 1.3 mmol per liter (5.4 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 2.29 mmol per liter (9.2 mg per 100 ml), the phosphorus 1.0 mmol per liter (3.1 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 76 g (the albumin 46 g and the globulin 30 g) per liter (7.6 g [4.6 g and 3.0 g] per 100 ml). The sodium was 135 mmol, the potassium 3.8 mmol, and the chloride 102 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) was 81 U (normal, 3 to 100), the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) 102 U (normal, 2 to 100), the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 94 U (normal, 34 to 100), the alkaline phosphatase 47 U (normal, 37 to 100), and the gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) 297 U per liter (normal, 13 to 100). An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 105 and was within normal limits. X-ray films of the chest revealed a patchy infiltrate in the lingula and the right middle lobe; the heart and mediastinum appeared normal.\nSpecimens of blood, urine, and stool were obtained for culture. Fluid and electrolytes were administered by vein, and the patient was observed without antibiotic treatment. During the next two days the temperature rose as high as 41.6\u00b0C, and antibiotic treatment was begun. During her hospital stay the patient received at various times cefazolin, cephradine, metronidazole, ceftizoxime, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, vancomycin, piperacillin, and erythromycin, but she remained febrile. The diarrhea subsided after several days. The patient did not cough or produce sputum. Repeated cultures of blood and urine yielded no microorganisms; a stool culture gave no growth of pathogenic bacteria, and microscopical examination of the stool for ova and parasites was negative. On the sixth hospital day the hematocrit was 30.7 percent; the white-cell count was 3500, with 52 percent neutrophils, 14 percent band forms, 25 percent lymphocytes, and 9 percent monocytes. The platelet count was 227,000, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 50 mm per hour. The iron was 51 \u03bcg (normal, 31 to 199), and the iron-binding capacity 326 \u03bcg per 100 ml (normal, 255 to 450). The vitamin B\nl2\nwas 1905 pg (normal, >200), and the folic acid 5.8 ng per milliliter (normal, >2.5). A tuberculin skin test was negative; no control antigen was used. Another x-ray film of the chest showed clearing of the infiltrates and was interpreted as within normal limits.\nOn the 10th hospital day the urea nitrogen was 4.28 mmol per liter (12 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 5.77 mmol per liter (104 mg per 100 ml), the cholesterol 1.16 mmol per liter (45 mg per 100 ml), the bilirubin 3.4 \u03bcmol per liter (0.2 mg per 100 ml), the uric acid 0.23 mmol per liter (3.9 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 1.99 mmol per liter (8.0 mg per 100 ml), the phosphorus 0.77 mmol per liter (2.4 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 61 g (the albumin 35 and the globulin 26 g) per liter (6.1 g [3.5 g and 2.6 g] per 100 ml). The ASAT was 192 U, the ALAT 145 U, the LDH 241 U, the alkaline phosphatase 34 U, and the GGTP 217 U per liter. A test for IgG antibodies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus was positive in a titer of 1:320, and a test for IgM antibodies was positive in a titer of less than 1:10. Tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibodies, hepatitis A antibodies, cold agglutinins, antinuclear antibodies, and antimitochondrial antibodies were negative. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, performed with intravenous and parenteral contrast material, disclosed that the spleen was at the upper limit of normal in size and appeared normal in other respects, as did the liver; the retroperitoneum, urinary tract, and pelvic organs were normal. An ultrasonographic study of the gallbladder was technically suboptimal because of apparent contraction of the gallbladder, but there was a suggestion of several gallstones with ultrasonic shadows. On the 12th hospital day a total body gallium scan showed no localization of the radionuclide in a potential septic source.\nOn the 13th hospital day the hematocrit was 28 percent; the white-cell count was 2100, with 55 percent neutrophils, 6 percent band forms, 36 percent lymphocytes, and 3 percent monocytes. The platelet count was 133,000. The prothrombin time was 13.4 seconds (normal, 11.1 to 12.5); the partial thromboplastin time was 33.7 seconds (normal, 23.4 to 31). The ASAT was 509 U, the ALAT 271 U, the LDH 437 U, the alkaline phosphatase 30 U, and the GGTP 380 U per liter. Another x-ray film of the chest was unchanged; no pulmonary consolidation was seen, and the pleural spaces were clear. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing room air, showed that the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO\n2\n) was 47 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO\n2\n) 36 mm Hg, and the pH 7.45. A radionuclide ventilation\u2014perfusion scan revealed no ventilation\u2014perfusion mismatches, relatively normal perfusion, and only minor disturbance of aeration on the ventilation scan. A test for chorionic gonadotropin was negative. A test on the patient's husband for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was reported to be negative.\nOn the 15th hospital day the hematocrit was 25.9 percent; the white-cell count was 2300, with 31 percent neutrophils, 2 percent band forms, 66 percent lymphocytes, and 1 percent monocytes. The platelet count was 76,000. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 81 \u03bcm\n3\nper cell, the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 27.8 pg per red cell, and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 34.4 percent. The ASAT was 529 U, and the ALAT 332 U per liter. Another x-ray film of the chest was normal. Microscopical examination of a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow was reported to be negative, and examination of a cervical lymph-node biopsy specimen was reported to show only lymphoid hyperplasia; cultures of both biopsy specimens yielded no microorganisms.\nOn the following day the hematocrit was 25.9 percent; the white-cell count was 1800, with 31 percent neutrophils, 7 percent band forms, 55 percent lymphocytes, and 7 percent monocytes. The platelet count was 73,000. The urea nitrogen was 1.43 mmol per liter (4 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 4.88 mmol per liter (88 mg per 100 ml), the cholesterol 1.94 mmol per liter (75 mg per 100 ml), the triglyceride 3.41 mmol per liter (302 mg per 100 ml), the bilirubin 6.84 \u03bcmol per liter (0.4 mg per 100 ml), the uric acid 0.10 mmol per liter (1.7 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 1.90 mmol per liter (7.6 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 61 g (the albumin 32 g and the globulin 29 g) per liter (6.1 g [3.2 g and 2.9 g] per 100 ml). The ASAT was 557 U, the ALAT 350 U, the LDH 387 U, the alkaline phosphatase 57 U, and the GGTP 1028 U per liter. An oral cholecystographic examination revealed faint opacification of the gallbladder, with multiple gallstones. A test for IgG antibodies to\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\nwas reported to be in the \"mid-positive\" range; a serologic test for syphilis, a test for leptospiral antibodies, and a Widal test were negative. On the 18th hospital day, while the patient was breathing oxygen at 4 liters per minute, a specimen of arterial blood disclosed that the PaO\n2\nwas 78 mm Hg, the PaCO\n2\n37 mm Hg, and the pH 7.46. On the 20th hospital day the hematocrit was 31.2 percent; the white-cell count was 2200, with 25 percent neutrophils, 8 percent band forms, and 67 percent lymphoctyes. The platelet count was 52,000. The urea nitrogen was 1.07 mmol per liter (3 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 6.88 mmol per liter (124 mg per 100 ml), the cholesterol 2.46 mmol per liter (95 mg per 100 ml), the triglyceride 2.87 mmol per liter (254 mg per 100 ml), the uric acid 0.09 mmol per liter (1.5 mg per 100 ml), the bilirubin 6.8 \u03bcmol per liter (0.4 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 65 g (the albumin 29 g and the globulin 36 g) per liter (6.5 g [2.9 g and 3.6 g] per 100 ml). The sodium was 140 mmol, the potassium 3.0 mmol, and the chloride 103 mmol per liter. The ASAT was 217 U, the ALAT 221 U, the LDH 303 U, the alkaline phosphatase 66 U, and the GGTP 1383 U per liter. The patient was transferred to this hospital.\nThe temperature was 39.8\u00b0C, the pulse was 101, and the respirations were 28. The blood pressure was 130/90 mm Hg.\nOn examination at admission to this hospital the patient appeared pale and acutely ill; she was lethargic but was easily aroused. No rash was detected. The head was normal. The neck was supple; a surgical dressing was present over the left cervical region; submandibular lymphadenopathy was noted bilaterally, but no abnormal lymph nodes were palpated in the axillary or inguinal regions. The lungs were clear. A Grade 2 systolic ejection murmur was heard along the left sternal border. The breasts were normal. Abdominal examination was negative; no organs, masses, or costovertebral-angle tenderness was detected. There was no peripheral edema, clubbing, or cyanosis, and the peripheral pulses were intact. On neurologic examination the patient was somnolent and unable to give details of her past history; her speech was fluent, and she was oriented to the month but not to the day. Diffuse weakness was noted, without focal abnormalities.\nThe urine gave a + test for protein and a trace-positive test for glucose; the sediment contained 4 white cells and rare casts per high-power field. The hematocrit was 33.8 percent; the white-cell count was 3300, with 18 percent neutrophils, 10 percent band forms, 54 percent lymphocytes, 11 percent atypical lymphocytes, 6 percent monocytes, and 1 percent eosinophils. The platelet count was 52,000, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 80 mm per hour. The prothrombin time was 9.4 seconds, with a control of 10.5 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 35.4 seconds. The urea nitrogen was 1.07 mmol per liter (3 mg per 100 ml), the creatinine 70.72 \u03bcmol per liter (0.8 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 6.27 mmol per liter (113 mg per 100 ml), the uric acid 0.09 mmol per liter (1.5 mg per 100 ml), the conjugated bilirubin 3.42 \u03bcmol per liter (0.2 mg per 100 ml), the total bilirubin 10.26 \u03bcmol per liter (0.6 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 2.10 mmol per liter (8.4 mg per 100 ml), the phosphorus 1.23 mmol per liter (3.8 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 69 g (the albumin 34 and the globulin 35 g) per liter (6.9 g [3.4 g and 3.5 g] per 100 ml). The sodium was 137 mmol, the potassium 3.1 mmol, the magnesium 1.3 mmol, the chloride 95 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 33 mmol per liter. The ASAT was 59 U, the LDH 416 U, the creatine kinase (CK) 101 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 30 U per liter. A specimen of arterial blood, obtained while the patient was breathing oxygen through nasal prongs, showed that the PaO\n2\nwas 68 mm Hg, the PaCO\n2\n45 mm Hg, and the pH 7.42. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 107, with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. An x-ray film of the chest (\nFig. 1\n) disclosed diffuse, bilateral interstitial infiltrates; no pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, or cardiac enlargement was seen. An x-ray film of the abdomen and a cranial CT scan were normal. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid that contained 2 red cells and 41 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 97 percent were lymphocytes and 3 percent nonhematic cells; the glucose was 2.89 mmol per liter (52 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 1.54 g per liter (154 mg per 100 ml); a serologic test for syphilis and a test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen were negative; microscopical examination of a stained specimen for acid-fast bacilli and of a fungal wet preparation was negative. Specimens of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained for culture. Acetaminophen was administered, and the temperature fell to 37.8\u00b0C. Diarrhea was again noted.\nOn the second hospital day the patient was more lethargic and was barely able to answer questions. The temperature rose as high as 39.8\u00b0C. Tachypnea was noted; physical examination was otherwise unchanged. The hematocrit was 30.3 percent, the white-cell count 6200, and the platelet count 63,000. The urea nitrogen was 1.07 mmol per liter (3 mg per 100 ml), the bilirubin 6.84 \u03bcmol per liter (0.4 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 66 g per liter (6.6 g per 100 ml).

Another electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 98 and was unchanged. An x-ray film of the chest, obtained with portable technique, revealed low lung volumes, but no infiltrates were seen; the heart and mediastinum appeared normal. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing oxygen at 4 liters per minute via nasal prongs, disclosed that the PaO\n2\nwas 68 mm Hg, the PaCO\n2\n45 mm Hg, and the pH 7.42. Elective intubation of the trachea was performed, and ventilatory assistance was administered. Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination disclosed no endobronchial lesions; there was mild erythema of the airways, with thin secretions; bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on the left lower lobe, and specimens were sent for cytologic examination and culture for acid-fast bacilli, brucella, mycoplasma and other bacteria and for fungal and viral cultures; microscopical examination of a stained specimen of the fluid showed no neutrophils and no definite microorganisms; examination of a fungal wet preparation was negative. A test on a stool specimen for\nClostridium difficile\ntoxin was negative.\nOn the third hospital day the patient remained intubated and on ventilatory assistance. Physical examination showed no change. The temperature was 38.2\u00b0C in the morning and rose at noon to 39.9\u00b0C. The hematocrit was 30.1 percent, the white-cell count 8800, and the platelet count 82,000. The urea nitrogen was 2.14 mmol per liter (6 mg per 100 ml), and the glucose 6.77 mmol per liter (122 mg per 100 ml). While the patient was being ventilated with 50 percent oxygen a specimen of arterial blood disclosed that the PaO\n2\nwas 92 mm Hg, the PaCO\n2\n46 mm Hg, and the pH 7.42. All bacteriologic cultures remained negative. Results of serologic tests at the referring hospital for legionella, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma, and Q fever were still pending. Another lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid that contained 6 red cells and 80 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 89 percent were lymphocytes, 3 percent monocytes, 1 percent neutrophils, and 7 percent nonhematic cells; the glucose was 3.66 mmol per liter (66 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 1.14 g per liter (114 mg per 100 ml); another serologic test for syphilis and a test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen were negative; specimens were again sent for culture. Further tests on the serum for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody were negative.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Elliott D. Kieff\\*: In summary, this 26-year-old woman was exposed to unsavory drinking water, mosquitoes, ticks, a rabbit bite, a farm fair, eggs contaminated with salmonella, a parturient cat with moribund kittens, and a drug-abusing husband. She had recently aborted a fetus. Concurrently with her salmonella exposure she had a dental infection and the development of headache, myalgia, nausea, watery diarrhea, and a temperature of 40\u00b0C. She took small amounts of penicillin. Vomiting and a sore throat developed, and cervical lymph nodes became enlarged and tender. After a fever of one week's duration she was admitted to another hospital, where patchy infiltrates in both mid-lung fields, leukopenia, immature polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and an elevated gamma glutamyl transpeptidase level were noted. Her temperature was 41.6\u00b0C. All bacterial cultures were negative over 20 days at the other hospital. Her course there was marked by persistence of fever, progressive anemia, with fall of the hematocrit to the range of 30 percent, thrombocytopenia, persistent leukopenia, moderate hepatocellular destruction without jaundice or an elevated alkaline phosphatase level, and blood gas values indicative of a mild to moderate diffusion block. A mid-positive IgG titer to *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* was noted. After an illness of four weeks' duration she was transferred to this hospital, where lethargy, poor memory, and disorientation were found but meningismus was absent. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid showed 154 mg per 100 ml of protein and 41 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter.Analysis of this complicated case with multisystem involvement must take into consideration both the total course of the clinical manifestations and the precise nature of each organ involvement. Known pathophysiologic manifestations of the diseases in the differential diagnosis should account for the patient's symptoms, signs, and laboratory abnormalities. Because of her previous good health I shall try to find a single disease to explain most or all of the clinical findings.For four weeks this young woman had a high fever, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mild hepatocellular destruction, diffuse pulmonary involvement with a diffusion block, and encephalopathy, with lymphocytes and an elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid. In short, the problem concerns fever, probable bone-marrow suppression or increased peripheral destruction of blood elements, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and aseptic meningoencephalitis. Since this was a documented febrile systemic illness that had baffled physicians for more than two weeks, it is helpful to think of it as a fever of unknown origin. In so doing, we need to consider three general categories of disease \u2014 infections, malignant tumors, and autoimmune, immune, toxic, metabolic, or genetic diseases.May we review the x-ray films now?Dr. Joanne O. Shepard: The initial film of the chest obtained at the other hospital shows lungs of very low volume with patchy opacities, principally in the right middle lobe and in the lingula. The second film from that hospital, obtained at a slightly better lung volume, shows similar findings. Several other studies were obtained, including a ventilation\u2013perfusion scan and a gallium scan, which showed no abnormalities. An ultrasound study of the upper portion of the abdomen revealed gallstones, and an abdominal CT scan showed no focal hepatic lesions or abdominal lymphadenopathy. The only finding was that the spleen was at the upper limit of normal in size.The first film of the chest obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a bilateral diffuse interstitial abnormality, which had developed since the studies at the other hospital. The second film, obtained two days later, demonstrates no change. The heart is of normal size, and no pleural effusions are seen.Dr. Kieff: I shall comment briefly on malignant tumors and autoimmune, immune, toxic, and metabolic, or genetic diseases because they cannot be excluded, although there is little evidence to support these diagnoses. With regard to autoimmune disease there is a history of recent exposure to penicillin, which is a known allergen, the illness was multisystemic, and there was a moderate elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate on at least one occasion. However, renal or cutaneous manifestations of autoimmune disease were not present. With regard to malignant tumors there were manifestations of bone-marrow involvement, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, but there were only a few band forms and no other immature cells in the peripheral circulation. No space-occupying lesion was demonstrated despite extensive radiographic investigation and bone-marrow and lymph-node biopsies. Still, early lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloproliferative disorders have not been excluded.The abrupt onset of this febrile illness suggests an infectious cause. What kind of infection \u2014 bacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic? Routine bacterial and fungal cultures were negative. There were band forms in the peripheral blood, but with persistent mild granulocytopenia rather than granulocytosis and with no evidence of a localized suppurative process. What infections are likely in the United States to cause a previously healthy young adult to have an acute febrile illness with persistently absent granulocytosis, reticuloendothelial organ involvement, involvement of the liver parenchyma, bone marrow, and lung, and aseptic meningoencephalitis with negative bacterial cultures? Typhoid fever, the typhoidal form of tularemia, brucellosis, legionellosis, culture-negative endocarditis, syphilis, Lyme disease, leptospirosis, tuberculosis, mycoplasma infection, Q fever, psittacosis, ehrlichiosis,[1](#core-r001) histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, HIV infection, Epstein\u2013Barr virus or cytomegalovirus infection, and toxoplasmosis are all in the differential diagnosis.I can eliminate most of these diagnoses because of particular features of this case. A serologic test for syphilis was negative, excluding the unlikely possibility of secondary syphilis. Ehrlichiosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis are not endemic in Massachusetts. Pure hepatocellular destruction would be an unusual manifestation of Lyme disease, culture-negative endocarditis, or cryptococcosis. There was no elevation of the alkaline phosphatase level, as would be expected with most bacterial, mycobacterial, or fungal infections, including brucellosis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis. When cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis and an elevated protein level are present with typhoid fever or typhoidal tularemia, tuberculosis, or systemic mycosis the glucose level is typically low, whereas in this patient it was normal. The cerebrospinal-fluid lymphocytosis and elevated protein concentration would be very unusual with legionellosis. During the first hospital admission the patient received multiple antibiotics, which would have had some effect on typhoid fever or tularemia. Diffuse pneumonitis is certainly unusual in patients with Lyme disease, culture-negative endocarditis, or leptospirosis. Thus, we are left with mycoplasma infection, Q fever, psittacosis, acute human immunodeficiency virus infection, Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus infection, and toxoplasmosis.*M. pneumoniae* is a major endemic cause of typical and atypical pneumonia. The infection usually begins in the respiratory tract. A cough is very common, but it was notably absent in this patient. Fever, headache, myalgia, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, interstitial infiltrates, and hemolytic anemia are common manifestations of *M. pneumoniae* infection. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatocellular damage, however, are distinctly unusual. Aseptic meningitis or meningoencephalitis are recognized but infrequent manifestations. The patient appropriately received erythromycin at the other hospital, but the response to that drug can be slow. The diagnosis of *M. pneumoniae* infection is usually made by seroconversion during the course of acute infection, although in vitro culture medium is available in most institutions. This patient's mid-positive-range IgG antibody titer on the 20th day of her illness is compatible with the diagnosis of acute *M. pneumoniae* infection but is nondiagnostic in itself, since mycoplasma antibody is found in a substantial fraction of normal adults. Psittacosis, a chlamydial infection, and Q fever, a rickettsial infection, fit almost all the features in the case record. Psittacosis frequently results from exposure to psittacine birds, but any avian species can be the source. A small but appreciable fraction of the patients have no obvious avian exposure. After inhalation the organisms infect the respiratory tract, and after a 14-day incubation period the early symptoms include headache, malaise, myalgia, pharyngitis, and even nausea and vomiting. A cough is very common and was absent in this case. Physical signs of pulmonary involvement are frequently lacking. The temperature is usually high. Cervical lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, and encephalopathy are frequent manifestations of psittacosis. Meningitis is infrequent but has been reported. The diagnosis is usually made by serologic conversion. Antibody is not prevalent in the normal population. Usually by two to three weeks of illness there is antibody to the chlamydial group-specific antigen, and the titers continue to rise for several weeks there-after. The response to tetracycline therapy is generally rapid and dramatic. Several cases of psittacosis are reported to the Massachusetts Health Department each year.Q fever has been reported in almost every state in the United States.[2](#core-r002) The infection is endemic at a low level in livestock and is believed to be spread by ticks, arthropod vectors, or aerosols to domestic animals or directly to human beings. Placental aerosols from infected animals have been an important source of human infection. In the last few years parturient cats with moribund kittens have been recognized to be the origin of human infection in eastern Canada.[3](#core-r003) The patient under discussion was exposed to a parturient cat with moribund kittens, to ticks, and to animals at a farm fair. The infection usually begins in the respiratory tract, with an incubation period of 7 to 12 days. Fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, mild pharyngitis, and some lymphadenopathy are common manifestations. The pulmonary signs are variable. Hepatic involvement is common. Focal hepatic necrosis can be the dominant hepatic finding, although granulomatous hepatitis is perhaps more frequent. Encephalopathy or encephalitis is common, and aseptic meningitis has been reported. Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and granulocytopenia have been reported. Thus, this patient's syndrome fits the diagnosis of Q fever. By the 28th day of the illness antibody to *Coxiella burnetii* should be present and rising in titer. Positive titers in normal persons are unusual. Response to tetracycline therapy is usually rapid and dramatic. Unfortunately, with regard to this diagnosis in the patient under discussion I have to be influenced by the great rarity of Q fever in Massachusetts.Epstein\u2013Barr virus is the usual cause of typical heterophil-positive and even of heterophil-negative infectious mononucleosis.[4](#core-r004) Cytomegalovirus and toxoplasma are less common causes of acute infectious mononucleosis syndromes. The human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and the human immunodeficiency virus are recently recognized causes of acute infectious mononucleosis syndromes.[5\u20138](#core-r005) Very little is known about the range of illness associated with HHV6 infection. Most of the patients are infected by HHV6 in early childhood. HHV6 causes exanthem subitum or roseola.[9](#core-r009) Three cases of possible primary HHV6 infection in adults with lymphadenopathy, atypical lymphocytosis, and hepatocellular dysfunction have been reported.[5](#core-r005) Fever, meningoencephalitis, and pneumonitis were not features of these cases. Acute primary HIV infection can have protean manifestations. Malaise, sore throat, fever, lymphadenopathy, diarrhea, and aseptic meningitis were manifestations in the few well-described cases.[6\u20138,10](#core-r006) Hepatitis was a feature of one case. Pneumonitis and bone-marrow suppression or autoimmune destruction have not been reported in association with acute HIV infection. Both findings have been reported in chronic HIV infection[11](#core-r011) but have not as yet been clearly tied directly to HIV infection as opposed to secondary infections or to secondary effects of chronic HIV infection on immune function. This patient's husband had been an intravenous drug abuser, but a test for antibodies to HIV was said to be negative. The risk of transmission by a single typical heterosexual experience is relatively low, but in this case a detailed sexual history is not available and heterosexual transmission certainly occurs.[12](#core-r012)Hepatitis is a common feature of acute Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus infections. The alkaline phosphatase level is frequently elevated in patients with these viral infections as a result of lymphoid infiltration of the liver, but hepatocellular destruction can predominate, as it did in this case. Aseptic meningoencephalitis, pneumonitis, and bone-marrow suppression are all well-recognized albeit less common manifestations of acute Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, or toxoplasma infection. It is certainly highly unusual for pure hepatocellular disease, diffuse pneumonitis, bone-marrow suppression, and aseptic meningoencephalitis to coexist in a previously healthy adult. Against Epstein\u2013Barr virus as the specific cause is that atypical lymphocytes, a very regular feature of acute Epstein\u2013Barr virus disease, were not noted until the end of the fourth week of illness, when the patient was transferred to this hospital. In the course of acute Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection the virus\u2013infected B lymphocytes may constitute 1 percent of the peripheral B lymphocytes. This circumstance characteristically engenders a vigorous natural killer cell, a nonspecific suppressor T lymphocyte, and a virus-mediated and HLA-mediated cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response. The cellular elements of this acute response have the morphologic features of atypical lymphocytes. Such cells occur to a lesser extent and less uniformly in response to cytomegalovirus or toxoplasma mononucleosis. So their absence in the acute illness of this patient is less against cytomegalovirus or toxoplasma infection than against Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection. Also somewhat against Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection is the positive IgG titer of 1:320 that was noted on the 14th day of the illness, with a borderline positive IgM titer. Since almost all adults are seropositive for Epstein\u2013Barr virus, only a rising titer of IgG antibody wold have diagnostic importance in this setting. The IgM titer should have been positive at that point. However, testing for the IgM level can be difficult; the usual tests employ antigens on slides or plates. When IgG antibody is present it can block the IgM binding and its subsequent detection. Cytomegalovirus infection can also be documented by a rising IgM or IgG antibody titer. Since IgG antibody to cytomegalovirus is common in the general population, single positive titers are not diagnostic. Although 1 percent of the adult population excretes cytomegalovirus in the urine without associated symptoms, cytomegalovirus can almost always be cultured from the urine of acutely infected symptomatic persons. Urine culture is therefore a sensitive although not uniformly specific indicator of serious cytomegalovirus infection. With the use of monoclonal antibodies to detect early cytomegalovirus antigen in tissue-culture cells the virus can frequently be detected in urine in 24 hours. The patient's 12-month-old son, who may have been at a day-care center, or her intravenous drug-abusing husband were each at risk for cytomegalovirus infection, which could have been transmitted to the patient. Toxoplasmosis is a less common cause of severe systemic infectious mononucleosis syndromes in normal persons in the United States. I had to search the medical literature extensively to identify a few cases of toxoplasmosis that had the range of organ-system involvement seen in this patient.[13,14](#core-r013) The presence of cats may have placed this patient at increased risk for toxoplasma infection. Cats are the definitive host for this parasite, and cat feces are an important source of human infection. The diagnosis of toxoplasma infection can be made by a high IgM antibody titer or by a rising IgG titer.In conclusion, we are dealing with a remarkably unusual agglomeration of somewhat infrequent manifestations of a common infection or a very uncommon disease. I cannot make a definitive diagnosis but can tell you how I would have proceeded toward a diagnosis. Serum should have been sent for a quantitative heterophil antibody assay, a repeated Epstein\u2013Barr virus antibody assay, with separation of IgG from IgM before IgM determination, and cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma, Q fever, psittacosis, and HIV IgG and IgM antibody assays. HIV antigen should have been assayed, and the urine should have been cultured for cytomegalovirus. A more detailed history of sexual exposure might have been helpful. I would probably have treated the patient with tetracycline while waiting for the results of these studies. The differential diagnosis includes cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus infections, Q fever, psittacosis, and acute HIV infection. If all the serologic (and antigen) studies were nondiagnostic, I would have been prepared to reassess.Dr. Eugene J. Mark: Dr. Butterton, will you tell us your impressions while you were caring for this patient?Dr. Joan R. Butterton: On our initial evaluation we were highly suspicious of a viral cause of her illness in view of the prodrome with lymphocytosis and leukopenia as well as the apparent hepatitis and aseptic meningitis. The picture, however, had been complicated by the prior antibiotic therapy. We were particularly concerned by the hypoxemia, and given the possibility of an HIV-related pulmonary infection we thought that we should proceed with a bronchoscopic examination as well as with further viral studies.Dr. Mark: May we have the medical students' diagnoses?Dr. Roger J. Pomerantz: The medical students considered a large number of infectious and noninfectious diseases to account for this young woman's multisystem disease. The noninfectious disorders included sarcoidosis, systemic lupus ery thematosus, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and vasculitis. The infectious diseases included brucellosis, tularemia, mycoplasma infection, psittacosis, Q fever, Lyme disease, syphilis, disseminated histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, *Pneumocystis carinii* pneumonia, and miliary tuberculosis. They thought that a viral infection was probable and concluded that the Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and HIV-1 were the most likely causative agents. They believed that the clinical picture was most consistent with an unusually severe acute HIV-1 seroconversion. The diagnostic tests were thought to be a bronchoscopic examination with biopsy and a sensitive test for HIV antibody or p24 antigen, or both.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Mark: Dr. Johnson, you also saw this patient for the Infectious Disease Service. Will you tell us about the diagnostic procedure and the subsequent course?Dr. R. Paul Johnson: The diagnostic procedure consisted of assays for the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in samples of the patient's blood and cerebrospinal fluid. HIV-1 antigen was detected at a level of 9.2 pg per milliliter in the cerebrospinal fluid but was absent in the serum. Viral cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid were positive after five days of cocultivation with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human peripheral-blood leukocytes. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HIV-1 was weakly positive on repeated tests and was confirmed by Western-blot analysis. An immunofluorescence assay with the use of the patient's serum was weakly positive when it was initially performed and strongly positive when it was repeated two weeks later. Routine viral cultures of blood, bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid, and urine were negative. After the results of those diagnostic studies were discussed with the patient, additional history was obtained of a heterosexual contact with an intravenous drug abuser approximately four weeks before the onset of her symptoms.The patient's findings are compatible with the diagnosis of acute HIV-1 infection with associated meningoencephalitis. Described shortly after the identification of HIV-1 as the cause of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1984 acute HIV infection was defined by the Centers for Disease Control as a mononucleosis-like syndrome, with or without aseptic meningitis, associated with seroconversion for HIV.[15](#core-r015) Although acute infection with HIV-1 is unrecognized in many patients, the results of two studies of homosexual men with HIV-1 seroconversion suggest that as many as 50 percent or more of affected persons may have an acute clinical illness.[16,17](#core-r016) Most symptomatic patients present with a mononucleosis-like illness with fever, lethargy, malaise, pharyngitis, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and lymphadenopathy.[6,16,18,19](#core-r006) Rashes have been observed frequently during primary HIV-1 infection and include an erythematous macular or mixed maculopapular rash,[6,18](#core-r006) a roseola-like exanthematous rash,[20](#core-r020) and a vesicular, pustular exanthem and enanthem.[7](#core-r007) Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, are found in a minority of the patients.[16](#core-r016) Symptomatic primary HIV-1 infection has been found in several populations at risk for HIV-1 infection, including homosexual men,[6,18](#core-r006) intravenous drug abusers,[6](#core-r006) hemophiliacs,[21](#core-r021) heterosexuals,[8](#core-r008) and health care workers with needle-stick injuries.[22](#core-r022) Estimates of the time of exposure to HIV-1 to the onset of symptoms have ranged from five days to three months, with a range of two to four weeks in the majority of the cases.[19](#core-r019)A spectrum of neurologic involvement ranging from mild headaches and photophobia to severe meningoencephalitis has been observed in patients with acute HIV-1 infection. Two of the three patients with primary HIV-1 infection described by Ho et al.[6](#core-r006) had a lymphocytic meningitis with fever and headache. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid revealed a pleocytosis (20 to 28 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter) with an elevated protein level (55 to 65 mg per 100 ml), and HIV-1 was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid obtained from one of these patients. Carne et al.[23](#core-r023) reported three cases of an acute reversible encephalopathy associated with HIV-1 seroconversion. The clinical findings included seizures, a peripheral atypical lymphocytosis, a pleocytosis in one of the three cases, and an abnormal cerebrospinal-fluid protein level in two of them. The authors of subsequent reports have described peripheral neuropathy, brachial neuritis,[7](#core-r007) myelitis,[24](#core-r024) and the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome[25](#core-r025) in association with primary HIV-1 infection. Neurologic impairment is generally self-limited, and most of the patients become asymptomatic in one to four weeks, although persistent neurologic deficits have been described.[7,24](#core-r007)Characteristic laboratory findings during primary HIV-1 infection include transient leukopenia, an atypical lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevation in the alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase activity,[16](#core-r016) but these abnormalities are nonspecific and may be seen in other acute viral infections. A variety of specific diagnostic tests have been used in the diagnosis of acute HIV-1 infection. Detection of seroconversion by ELISA generally occurs four to eight weeks after the onset of symptoms and is therefore an insensitive diagnostic test at the time of the onset of symptoms.[26](#core-r026) Immunofluorescence and Western blot techniques are able to detect antibodies earlier in the course of the infection, and when a specific IgM immunofluorescence assay is used a positive result may be obtained as early as five days after the onset of symptoms.[26](#core-r026) Assays of HIV-1 antigen in serum or cerebrospinal fluid have proved useful in detecting infection before seroconversion and provide a rapid diagnosis in many patients with suspected primary HIV-1 infection, in some of them as early as 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.[27\u201329](#core-r027) In one report all 13 patients with symptomatic HIV-1 seroconversion for whom serum samples were available in the first 18 days after the onset of symptoms had positive tests for HIV-1 antigen.[28](#core-r028) Viral culture, radioimmunoprecipitation, and detection of specific IgM responses have also demonstrated viral infection before seroconversion determined by ELISA but are not widely available.The natural history of disease in patients with primary HIV-1 syndromes is not yet well defined. In most cases the illness does not progress to AIDS for a number of years after infection,[30](#core-r030) although there has been a report of one case in which the diagnosis of AIDS was made two months after acute seroconversion.[31](#core-r031) It is not yet known whether patients who have a mononucleosis-like illness or neurologic complications have a different progression of disease than patients who undergo asymptomatic seroconversion. At present there is no proved benefit of antiviral therapy in patients with acute HIV infection, and in most patients the symptoms resolve spontaneously within several weeks. Research is in progress to define better the role of antiviral therapy early in the course of retroviral infection, both in animal models[32](#core-r032) and in human beings.[33](#core-r033)This patient's encephalopathy improved considerably over the next four to six weeks without specific antiviral therapy, and in the opinion of her family and primary-care physician her condition was thought to have returned to normal. Alopecia developed during this time but has subsequently begun to resolve. Four months after admission examination was negative except for some difficulty with calculations. The ASAT was 72 U per liter, the total bilirubin 6.84 \u03bcmol per liter (0.4 mg per 100 ml), the direct bilirubin 3.42 \u03bcmol per liter (0.2 mg per 100 ml), the alkaline phosphatase 62 U, and the LDH 228 U per liter.Dr. Mark: Slides of the cervical lymph node that had been biopsied at another hospital were obtained after the patient was discharged from this hospital. Microscopical examination showed a mononuclearcell infiltrate in both the cortex and the medulla that obscured the normal follicles, which appeared as small residues surrounded by sheets of the mononuclear cells ([Fig. 2](#f002) and [3](#f003)). There were occasional neutrophils amid the mononuclear cells. These histologic changes, although nonspecific, have been described recently in eight patients with unsuspected HIV infection who were subsequently shown to have the infection by ELISA and Western blot assay.[34](#core-r034) The authors of many reports have described the histologic changes in the lymph nodes of patients with AIDS and the AIDS-related complex. In general, lymph nodes in early stages of the disease are hyperplastic; later there is a gradual depletion of the lymph nodes, and finally the lymph-node cells are markedly depleted.[35\u201338](#core-r035) Changes in tissues in patients with very recent seroconversion have not yet been well studied. However, viral particles have been identified in lymph nodes in patients with AIDS-related lymphadenopathy.[39\u201342](#core-r039)Dr. Kieff: Has pneumonitis been noted previously in the HIV-associated acute infectious mononucleosis syndrome?Dr. Mark: A T-lymphocyte alveolitis was observed in the majority of 276 HIV-infected patients and could have been responsible for their cough, dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, and abnormalities of pulmonary-function tests.[43](#core-r043) The alveolitis was seen both early in HIV infection when the patients had no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease in the lungs and late in HIV infection when the patients had respiratory symptoms as well as opportunistic infections or tumors. The lymphocytes were demonstrated to be cytotoxic T lymphocytes that were CD8-positive and D44-positive.[43](#core-r043) In one patient with AIDS a primary pulmonary large-cell lymphoma developed.[44](#core-r044)Dr. Bruce D. Walker: It was interesting that both the blood and the cerebrospinal-fluid cultures were positive after only five days of cocultivation with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphoblasts, indicating a heavy viral burden. This case also illustrates that the cerebrospinal fluid may be seeded by the virus very early in the course of the infection, which is an important consideration in devising potential antiviral strategies to treat these patients.\n",

      "question": "A 41-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of a pelvic mass and bilateral hydronephrosis.\nThe patient was well until 19 days earlier, when she twisted her left ankle while on a cruise to the Bahamas. Immediately thereafter progressive swelling developed in the left leg. Two weeks before entry the patient noticed a mass in the lower left side of the abdomen. Six days before admission she consulted a physician. An ultrasonographic examination of the left leg, performed on the following day, was reported to show no evidence of thrombi. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the pelvis was said to show a large pelvic mass that was more extensive on the left side, filled the pelvis, and compressed both ureters, with bilateral hydronephrosis; the mass also compressed the iliac arteries and veins as well as the urinary bladder and rectum; the liver appeared normal. An x-ray film of the chest was reported to be normal.\nThe patient was admitted to another hospital, where physical examination disclosed a large, very firm, immobile mass in the left side of the pelvis; no tenderness was found; the liver was not felt. The left leg was twice the volume of the right leg from the ankle to the thigh; no erythema or tenderness was detected. On pelvic examination the perineum appeared normal; the cervix was smooth and soft; threads of an intrauterine device (IUD) were palpated; the uterus and pelvic mass seemed to be contiguous. The urea nitrogen was 32 mmol per liter (91 mg per 100 ml), and the creatinine 990 \u03bcmol per liter (11.2 mg per 100 ml). On the day of entry cystoscopic examination was performed, and the examiner suspected the presence of gross tumor in the bladder but obtained no biopsy specimen; a left ureteral stent was inserted, and an infusion of heparin was administered by vein. The swelling of the left leg resolved in two or three days. On the fourth hospital day a right ureteral stent was inserted. On the following day the urea nitrogen was 14 mmol per liter (38 mg per 100 ml), and the creatinine 210 \u03bcmol per liter (2.4 mg per 100 ml). On the fifth hospital day the patient was transferred to this hospital.\nThe patient was divorced and worked in a clerical position. She smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily and rarely consumed alcohol. About two months before admission she consulted a physician because of occasional mild, crampy abdominal pains of about four months' duration. A mild, nondescript anemia was found, and radiographic studies of the gastrointestinal tract were said to be negative. The abdominal pain subsided completely thereafter. The patient had lost about 7 kg on a weight-reduction diet during the two months before her cruise. Her father had had carcinoma of the colon; her mother died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a brother died of carcinoma of the larynx; there was no family history of ovarian or breast carcinoma. The patient had not experienced anorexia, hematuria, dysuria, or change in bowel habit, and her menses were normal; her last menstrual period had occurred three weeks before admission.\nThe temperature was 38\u00b0C, the pulse was 88, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg.\nThe patient was a thin woman who appeared well. No lymphadenopathy was found. The head, neck, and lungs were normal. A Grade 2 systolic murmur was present. The breasts were normal. Abdominal examination revealed a firm, nontender mass that extended 7 to 8 cm above the left inguinal ligament and had a diameter of 16 to 17 cm on bimanual examination; the mass invaded the rectovaginal septum and was fixed to the sacrum; the liver and spleen were not felt. On pelvic examination the cervix felt normal, and a string was again palpated. The extremities were normal; no pitting edema or swelling of the left leg was found. Neurologic examination was negative.\nThe urine gave a + + test for protein and had a specific gravity of 1.011; the sediment contained 2 white cells per high-power field and was packed with red cells. The hematocrit was 30.5 percent; the white-cell count was 24,100 (24.1 \u00d7 10\n9\nper liter). The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 81 f1 (81 \u03bcm\n3\nper cell), the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 1.7 pg per cell (27.1 pg per red cell), and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 33.2 percent. The prothrombin time was 10.2 seconds, with a control of 10.4 seconds. The urea nitrogen was 13 mmol per liter (37 mg per 100 ml), the creatinine 210 \u03bcmol per liter (2.4 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 6.3 mmol per liter (114 mg per 100 ml), the bilirubin 10 \u03bcmol per liter (0.6 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 2.3 mmol per liter (9.0 mg per 100 ml), and the phosphorus 2.0 mmol per liter (6.2 mg per 100 ml). The alkaline phosphatase was 127 U per liter (new normal for a woman, 30 to 100). An electrocardiogram disclosed a normal rhythm at a rate of 78 and was within normal limits. The CA-125 was 16.7 U per milliliter.\nTrimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, phenazopyridine hydrochloride, and oxycodone\u2014acetaminophen were given by mouth. During the next two days the temperature ranged between 37.8 and 37.4\u00b0C. The patient required repeated doses of oxycodone\u2014acetaminophen for pain that she localized to the area of her urinary bladder. On the third hospital day the sodium was 140 mmol, the potassium 4.3 mmol, the chloride 99 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 30.0 mmol per liter. An ultrasonographic examination of the pelvis (\nFig. 1\n) disclosed a complex, echogenic, solid-appearing pelvic mass, 14 cm in transverse diameter, 9.6 cm in the anteroposterior dimension, and 10 cm in vertical dimension; the uterus and ovaries could not be identified clearly separate from the mass, and no intrauterine device, ascitic fluid, or fluid in the cul-de-sac was seen; moderate bilateral hydronephrosis was present.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Howard M. Goodman\\*: This 41-year-old woman presented with a large pelvic mass, probable deep venous thrombosis, and renal failure secondary to bilateral ureteral obstruction. The differential diagnosis for this presentation includes both benign and malignant neoplasms, inflammatory processes, and idiopathic conditions \u2014 specifically, retroperitoneal fibrosis. Several historical features not available in the case record might have assisted in making a diagnosis, particularly information about the use of oral contraceptives, the occurrence of sexually transmitted diseases, and reports of previous Papanicolaou smears. Because these data are not given, I shall assume that they are not critical to the differential diagnosis. I shall examine the three striking features of this woman's illness separately in an attempt to reach the correct diagnosis.\\*Obstetrician/gynecologist, Brigham and Women's Hospital; assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology. Harvard Medical School.May we see the radiographs?Dr. Nicholas Papanicolaou: The examinations from the other hospital are not available. The only study that was performed at this hospital before the diagnostic procedure was a pelvic ultrasound study ([Fig. 1](#f001) ). A sagittal view of the pelvis shows the urinary bladder and what appears to be part of the uterus; a huge noncystic, lobulated mass with multiple echoes is associated with the pelvic structures. On a transverse image the mass is also visible; the uterus and ovaries cannot be distinguished from it, and no free fluid is visible in the pelvis. There is mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis, and stents can be identified in the bladder.Dr. Goodman: This patient initially presented with leg swelling after trauma to the left ankle. Although an ultrasound study of the leg revealed no evidence of venous thrombosis, the response to heparin suggests its presence. For the purpose of this discussion I shall assume that thrombophlebitis was present and that the history of trauma was unrelated to the thrombosis. An association of thrombophlebitis with cancer was first suggested by Trousseau[1](#core-r001) in 1865. Since then the syndrome that bears his name has been reviewed extensively, with cancers of the pancreas, breast, prostate gland, colon, lung, stomach, and urinary bladder usually topping the lists of the associated malignant tumors.[2\u20135](#core-r002) It has been suggested that plasminogen activator released from cancer cells or perhaps other tumor cell products activate the coagulation cascade and initiate the thromboembolism seen in this syndrome.[6](#core-r006) Trousseau's syndrome is only rarely associated with gynecologic malignant tumors, although it has been reported in women with endometrial, ovarian, and cervical adenocarcinomas.[2\u20139](#core-r002) The overwhelming majority of these gynecologic tumors have been ovarian carcinomas.A paraneoplastic syndrome, however, need not be hypothesized as the cause of venous thrombosis in this case. Any pelvic mass compressing the iliac veins, including ovarian cysts of many types, uterine leiomyomas, and the gravid uterus, may lead to venous thrombosis. Cervical cancer is commonly associated with iliac-vein and femoral-vein thrombosis, not so much as a result of extrinsic pressure from the primary mass but as a result of lymph-node metastases on the pelvic sidewall.[10](#core-r010) The CT scan in this case apparently revealed compression of the iliac vessels, which can be associated with virtually all disease processes that either give rise to pelvic masses or spread to the pelvic sidewall.Renal failure apparently secondary to ureteral compression is also a nonspecific feature of this case. Large masses of all types, including benign ovarian cysts, uterine leiomyomas, pelvic abscesses, and even a gravid uterus, may cause extrinsic compression on the ureter.[11\u201313](#core-r011) In the last situation, right-sided hydronephrosis with retention of normal renal function is the rule and has been termed \"physiologic hydroureter\" or \"hydronephrosis of pregnancy.\" Endometriosis may cause ureteral compression, occasionally as a result of a large endometriotic cyst but more commonly as a result of periureteral endometriosis with scarring.[14,15](#core-r014) The two gynecologic cancers most commonly associated with hydronephrosis are ovarian carcinoma and cervical carcinoma.[16\u201318](#core-r016) Large ovarian masses often compress the ureter, and cervical carcinoma does so as a result of lymph-node involvement on the pelvic sidewall or direct extension of the primary tumor in the parametrial tunnels immediately adjacent to the cervix.The presence of a pelvic mass is the third feature in the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis of a pelvic mass is long, encompassing benign and malignant primary tumors of virtually all pelvic organs, lymphoproliferative disorders, metastatic cancers, inflammatory processes, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and endometriosis. The vague radiologic appearance of the mass suggests an infiltrative or inflammatory process, making less likely common masses such as benign or functional ovarian cysts, uterine leiomyomas, endometriotic tissue, and epithelial ovarian cancers, which together account for the vast majority of pelvic masses in women of reproductive age. Although I cannot exclude these diagnoses solely on the basis of the radiographic findings, they have fairly characteristic radiologic features not demonstrated in this case. The normal CA-125 level does not allow us to determine the nature of the mass, since this marker is elevated in only 75 percent of cases of epithelial ovarian cancer.[19](#core-r019) Even slight elevations are nondiagnostic, being seen in cases of uterine leiomyomas, adenomyosis, endometriosis, and pelvic inflammatory disease.[20](#core-r020)Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis must also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Although first described by the French urologist Albarran,[21](#core-r021) this disease was first recognized as a distinct entity by Ormond.[22](#core-r022) Its cause remains obscure, with trauma, extravasated urine, adjacent infection, or autoimmune reaction having been suggested as the cause of the nonsuppurative inflammatory reaction in the retroperitoneum characteristic of this disease.[23\u201326](#core-r023) The association of methysergide with retroperitoneal fibrosis supports the hypothesis that it may be an immune phenomenon.[27](#core-r027) This disease may occur at any level in the retroperitoneum, and in a substantial proportion of the cases it is associated with a pelvic\u2014abdominal mass.[26](#core-r026) The early symptoms are nonspecific, including abdominal, back, or flank pain, anorexia, nausea, malaise, and weight loss. Ureteral compromise occurs in the vast majority of the cases, with characteristic medial deviation of the ureters demonstrable on excretory urographic examination.[25](#core-r025) Lower-extremity edema as a result of either lymphatic or venous obstruction may be present.[28](#core-r028) The diagnosis is usually made at the time of exploration and biopsy, although characteristic radiologic findings may allow medical management, obviating the need for exploration. The findings in this case could be explained by idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis, which must remain high on the list of differential diagnoses.The critical item in this patient's history that I have not as yet addressed is the presence of the IUD, which has led me to assume that she had extensive pelvic actinomycosis. *Actinomyces israelii* is a gram-positive, anaerobic, non-acid-fast, filamentous bacterium of the order Actinomycetales. Although true bacteria, actinomyces were misclassified at one time as fungi.[29](#core-r029) Part of this confusion arose from the characteristic histologic finding in actinomycosis \u2014 the sulfur granules.[30](#core-r030) These are tiny bacterial colonies that result from secretion of a polysaccharide protein material that cements the bacterial elements together. Histologic examination of these colonies has given rise to the term \"ray fungus,\" which may account for the classification error. Bollinger[31](#core-r031) first described sulfur granules in lumpy jaw, an infection of the bovine mandible caused by *A. bovi*. Israel[32](#core-r032) first demonstrated sulfur granules in human autopsy material in 1878, and he and Wolff[33](#core-r033) successfully cultured the organism 13 years later.Actinomyces and related species are endogenous oral flora inhabiting periodontal pockets, carious teeth, and tonsillar crypts. These organisms are not particularly virulent, requiring disruption of mucosal barriers by trauma, infection, or surgical injury for invasion of underlying tissues.[34,35](#core-r034) Cervicofacial infection may follow dental infection and dental procedures or any traumatic injury to the oral mucosa. Thoracic infection involving the lungs, pleura, mediastinum, or chest wall follows aspiration of infected oral debris, esophageal penetration, direct extension from the neck, or transdiaphragmatic spread from the abdomen. According to the review by Cope,[34](#core-r034) infection of these sites accounts for 85 percent of all actinomycotic infections. Abdominal involvement usually has a gastrointestinal source and most often occurs after an operation for appendicitis or another inflammatory bowel process. The infection also occasionally follows a routine gastrointestinal operation, diverticulitis with perforation, peptic-ulcer disease, or penetrating abdominal trauma.[35](#core-r035) Rarely, nonpenetrating trauma gives rise to actinomycotic infection.[35](#core-r035)Actinomycotic infections at all sites are characterized by a long latency period and a delay in the diagnosis. On pathological examination abdominal disease is characterized by microabscess formation with progression to the formation of chronic sinuses and fistulas. Surrounding woody induration is characteristic and, once encountered clinically, is not quickly forgotten. Infected patients present with a low-grade fever, mild anemia, abdominal pain, or nausea and vomiting. Intermittent bowel obstruction or ureteral compromise may be seen. Thus, the presentation in the case under discussion is consistent with actinomycosis.Pelvic involvement by actinomyces has generally been thought to originate from the gastrointestinal tract, specifically after appendicitis, accounting for the predominance of right-sided infections usually reported in the literature.[36,37](#core-r036) The possibility of an ascending infection was first suggested in 1926 by the association of intrauterine pessaries and other intrauterine metallic devices with pelvic actinomycosis.[38,39](#core-r038) It was not until 1973 that Henderson[40](#core-r040) reported the association of pelvic actinomycosis with the newer IUDs, and this association has been confirmed by a multitude of later reports.[41\u201343](#core-r041) Gupta and his coworkers[43](#core-r043) first described the identification of actinomyces on Papanicolaou smears, providing an excellent method for screening IUD wearers for the presence of this organism. It would be interesting to know this patient's Papanicolaou-smear findings and whether there was any suggestion of the presence of actinomyces in the past. Vallicenti et al.[44](#core-r044) studied 69,000 Papanicolaou smears prospectively and demonstrated a prevalence of *A. israelii* among IUD users ranging from 1.6 percent in the general population to over 5 percent in the clinic population. Those authors confirmed the cytologic identification of bacterial elements with direct immunofluorescence techniques. Keebler et al.[41](#core-r041) reviewed the Papanicolaou smears of over 1400 women with IUDs in place and found that the overall colonization rate was 12.6 percent, with the risk clearly related to the duration of IUD use. Infection was unusual if the device had been in place for less than two years. We are not informed of the duration of IUD use in the patient under discussion, but I shall assume that it had not been inserted recently.Pelvic actinomycosis usually presents a diagnostic puzzle to the clinician, with the correct diagnosis rarely made before laparotomy. An acute presentation is unusual; the disease commonly has a subacute or chronic course lasting for months to years. The nonspecific manifestations of lower abdominal pain, pressure, vaginal discharge, weight loss, mild anemia, and vaginal bleeding seen in this disease underscore its insidious nature. Extensive disease with tubo-ovarian abscess formation and surrounding woody induration leading to a \"frozen pelvis\" may mimic an advanced pelvic cancer.Spagnuolo and Fransioli[45](#core-r045) reported the case of a 43-year-old woman who several months previously had had an 11-year-old IUD removed and later presented with constipation and a right-sided pelvic mass. Large-bowel obstruction soon developed, and ultimately an abdominoperineal resection with hysterectomy and removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries was required to clear the diffuse pelvic process. Pathological examination revealed actinomycosis as the sole cause. We reported a similar case of a woman who had undergone IUD removal and also presented with a pelvic mass, large-bowel obstruction, and hydronephrosis; that patient responded to prolonged antibiotic therapy before definitive resection of the area involved by her actinomycotic disease.[46](#core-r046)In summary, this patient presented with a pelvic mass associated with bilateral ureteral obstruction and probable deep venous thrombosis. Radiographic examination demonstrated that the mass obliterated tissue planes, suggesting an inflammatory or infiltrative process. A variety of neoplastic or inflammatory processes as well as idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis could be postulated as the cause, but the presence of the IUD directs me to a diagnosis of actinomyces-associated pelvic inflammatory disease with abscess formation. I suspect that the diagnostic procedure was an exploration in view of the probable overwhelming concern that a malignant tumor was present. It is possible that a preoperative diagnosis of actinomycosis was established by removal of the IUD with endometrial sampling or dilatation and curettage, which may have permitted culture or histologic identification of actinomyces. As I mentioned earlier, the diagnosis of actinomycosis is rarely made before laparotomy, which is unfortunate since long-term antibiotic therapy with penicillin or tetracycline may soften the induration, minimizing the morbidity and complexity of the ultimate resection.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Hoover, will you tell us your impressions and describe the diagnostic procedure?Dr. Herbert C. Hoover, Jr.: This patient was transferred to my service after a few days in another hospital. By the time that she arrived at this hospital the thrombosis of the left femoral vein and the leg swelling had resolved, but the very large pelvic mass, which was compressing her rectum almost completely and was obstructing both ureters, remained. Ureteral stents had been placed at the other hospital, and her renal function had become almost normal on admission here. She had a low-grade fever but appeared healthy otherwise. She had lost some weight, but that loss was self-induced in preparation for her cruise in the Caribbean.A barium-enema examination demonstrated nearly total extrinsic obstruction of the rectum, which was displaced far to the left side. The initial diagnostic procedure was an evaluation under anesthesia that consisted of a cystoscopic examination and an unsuccessful attempt at removal of the IUD. At the cystoscopic examination Dr. Althausen found a friable mucosa that had the appearance of a tumor invading the bladder posteriorly; several biopsy specimens were taken. I did a proctoscopic examination. The rectum appeared to be invaded on the right side by a tumor. I obtained biopsy specimens. Dilatation and curettage were attempted but were not possible because of cervical stenosis. The IUD could not be removed.Dr. Alex F. Althausen: The base and trigone of the bladder were displaced anteriorly, a finding consistent with extrinsic impression. I used a resectoscope loop to resect a portion of the mucosa with evident bullous edema, hoping to obtain a biopsy specimen adequate for a diagnosis.Dr. Barbara A. Centeno: Microscopical examination of the biopsy specimen of the bladder revealed a purulent exudate in the muscularis and submucosa. Within the pus we identified a round, pink-to-purple, granular mass, typical of a sulfur granule ([Fig. 2](#f002)). The sulfur granule is so named for its macroscopic yellow, granular appearance resembling crystalline sulfur.The periphery of the sulfur granule was rimmed by partially confluent radiate, eosinophilic, club-shaped structures ([Fig. 3](#f003)). This appearance is known as the Splendore\u2014Hoeppli phenomenon. First described in 1908 by Splendore[47](#core-r047) as coating sporotrichia and again in 1932 by Hoeppli[48](#core-r048) around the ova of *Schistosoma japonicum*, this change has subsequently been reported as surrounding fungi, bacteria, and helminths as well as inert substances.[49](#core-r049) Its pathogenesis is unknown. Early studies identified immunoglobulins in the club-shaped structures, leading to the conclusion that they are the result of immunoglobulin and antigen\u2013antibody deposition.[49](#core-r049) In later studies other authors have postulated that the phenomenon has its origin in cationic polypeptides released from leukocytes.[50](#core-r050) Two more recent investigations, in which immunofluorescent antibodies to eosinophil-granule major basic protein were used, have identified this protein in this phenomenon surrounding schistosomal eggs and larvae of *Baylisascaris procyonis*.[51,52](#core-r051) At the center of the sulfur granules there are branching, filamentous bacteria that are gram-positive when stained with a Brown and Hopps stain and argyrophilic when stained by the Grocott\u2014methenamine-silver stain. They are not stained with a Fite modified acid-fast stain. These are the typical histologic findings of infection by actinomyces,[53](#core-r053) which proved on culture to be *A. israelii*. In addition to the purulent exudate containing sulfur granules, the presence of fibrous tissue, a mononuclear-cell infiltrate, and granulation tissue in the bladder wall indicated the probable presence of a fistula tract. Actinomyces were also present in biopsy specimens of the endocervix and the submucosa of the rectum, in association with a fistulous tract. The rectal mucosa was intact.The histologic differential diagnosis of actinomycosis includes nocardiosis, botryomycosis, mycetomas, and the presence of pseudoactinomycotic radiate granules. Unlike actinomyces, the filaments of *Nocardia asteroides* causing pulmonary and other organ infections do not form sulfur granules but are distributed diffusely throughout the purulent exudate. The filaments of nocardia are not readily identified with a hematoxylin-and-eosin stain but are gram-positive with a Brown and Hopps stain and are stained by both a Grocott\u2014methenamine-silver stain and a Fite modified acid-fast stain.[53](#core-r053)Both botryomycosis and mycetomas form characteristic sulfur granules. Botryomycosis is a chronic bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, rarely affecting the viscera. Mycetomas, chronic deforming infections of the lower legs that are complicated by draining sinuses, occur predominantly in the tropics. These infections are divided into two categories \u2014 actinomycetomas caused by certain actinomycetales, such as *N. brasiliensis* and *Streptomyces somaliensis, S.* (Actinomadura) *madurae*, and *S*. (Actinomadura) *pelletieri*, and eumycotic (true fungal) mycetomas. Both botryomycosis and the two categories of mycetomas can be separated on the basis of histologic and microbiologic studies.[53](#core-r053)Pseudoactinomycotic radiate granules, also called pseudosulfur granules, mimic sulfur granules in preparations stained with hematoxylin and eosin. These structures have been reported in the endocervix, both in the presence and in the absence of an intrauterine contraceptive device,[54,55](#core-r054) and in inspissated mucus.[56](#core-r056) They are similar to structures resembling hyphae re ported in third ventricular colloid cysts.[57](#core-r057) Common to the granules in all these locations is a mucinous milieu.[56](#core-r056) Histologic, microbiologic, transmission-microscopical and scanning-electron\u2014microscopical examinations, and backscatter electron imaging studies have failed to identify any organisms in these granules.[56](#core-r056) X-ray microanalysis has identified varying amounts of copper, sulfur, iron, chloride, and phosphorus distributed in the granules and in their immediate vicinity.[58](#core-r058) All these substances are present in biologically active substances. Degradation of lipofuscin and sulfated mucopolysaccharides and mucoproteins can account for the presence of some of these elements.[58](#core-r058)The patient's previous Papanicolaou smears were not available for review. A Papanicolaou smear prepared concurrently with the biopsies and endocervical curettage contained fuzzy or woolly, blue-gray masses of filamentous organisms, typical of actinomyces as they appear on Papanicolaou smears ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The Splendore\u2014Hoeppli phenomenon may appear as club-shaped, golden-brown, reddish, or yellow structures around the organisms.[59](#core-r059) Sulfur granules are rarely seen in a Papanicolaou smear in cases of actinomycosis, however, except when there is a severe purulent response.[59](#core-r059)Mimics of actinomyces on Papanicolaou smears include bacteria such as lactobacilli, nocardia, and leptothrix, fungi such as candida and aspergillus, and inert substances such as fibrin, contraceptive cream, IUD-associated material, cotton and synthetic fibers, and mucus strands.[60](#core-r060) Crystalline bodies found in the cervical-mucus portion of the smears are the cytologic counterpart of the pseudoactinomycotic radiate granules[60](#core-r060) and should be differentiated from actinomyces. All these structures can be differentiated on the basis of their morphologic and histochemical staining properties. In addition, *A. israelii* can be identified with an immunofluorescence technique,[59](#core-r059) which is both sensitive and specific in cases in which the diagnosis may be questionable or early in the course of the disease, before the organisms aggregate to form masses.Dr. Scully: Dr. Hoover, will you describe the further surgical approach to this patient?Dr. Hoover: We were puzzled after our evaluation of the patient under anesthesia and cystoscopic and other examinations. We did not receive the diagnosis of actinomycosis immediately, and with the large pelvic mass and the perplexing clinical situation we had scheduled the patient for a laparotomy for further diagnosis three days later. On the day before the planned laparotomy we received a preliminary diagnosis of pelvic actinomycosis but were still concerned about the possibility of an ovarian cancer in addition. Symptoms of small-bowel obstruction developed, and we performed an exploratory laparotomy on the following day. The patient did have a high-grade small-bowel obstruction, with the proximal small bowel from the ligament of Treitz down to an obstructed loop stuck to an inflammatory mass and dilated to 6 cm in diameter. The rest of the distal bowel was decompressed. A huge mass arose from the center of the pelvis and obscured the urinary bladder. The uterus could not be found but was obviously in the center of this mass. There were bilateral ovarian cysts, and on the right side a cyst was involved in tissue with woody induration. It was very difficult to do a dissection in the pelvis. Both ureters and both iliac arteries and veins were also encased in the inflammatory process.We obtained multiple biopsy specimens, and I freed up the obstructed loop of small bowel. We called infectious-disease and pathological consultants into the operating room. Multiple frozen-section examinations demonstrated only an inflammatory reaction. I d\u00e9brided as much of the abscess as possible to relieve the pressure on the rectum, which was nearly obstructed. We considered doing a hysterectomy, but it would have been virtually impossible to avoid perforating the bladder and damaging the ureters during the procedure. The gynecologists tried very hard to remove the IUD, but it was too firmly embedded in the uterine wall. We administered high doses of antibiotics postoperatively. The patient was in the hospital for about three weeks, receiving antibiotics intravenously, and she continued to take them for several additional weeks at home. The infectious-disease consultants planned a three-month course of intravenously administered antibiotics. She has been very well and will eventually undergo at least a hysterectomy.Dr. Spyros Kalams: I was an infectious-disease consultant. A Gram stain of the pus showed numerous actinomyces, stains for acid-fast bacilli were negative, and cultures yielded the actinomyces two weeks later. Rare klebsiella and several anaerobic bacteria were identified as well. The patient initially received penicillin, metronidazole, and ceftriaxone for several weeks, and after all the cultures were completed and all the anaerobes cultured were shown to be sensitive to pencillin, the ceftriaxone and metronidazole were discontinued about a month after initiation of the antibiotics. A follow-up CT scan obtained approximately one month after discharge still showed a complex mass, which was somewhat smaller, and a more recent CT scan revealed further shrinkage of the mass. The patient is currently receiving penicillin administered intravenously in a high dose (15 million units a day).Dr. Goodman, how would you treat a patient with this infection who had an IUD in place?Dr. Goodman: I can understand the frustrations that Dr. Hoover must have experienced in the operating room. The characteristic woody induration obliterates all tissue planes, preventing any attempt at dissection, and conservative management is indicated. It is virtually impossible to resect masses of this type without doing an exenterative procedure. In general, we have recommended correction of obstructive problems with ureteral stenting or percutaneous nephrostomy for urinary tract obstruction and colostomy for large-bowel obstruction, followed by long-term antibiotic therapy. Large masses may shrink considerably; perhaps of more importance is that surgical planes may become identifiable, permitting a more conservative resection.There is no consensus on the treatment of asymptomatic patients with an IUD who are found to have actinomyces on a Papanicolaou smear. Some observers have recommended removal of the IUD and its immediate replacement with another IUD, others have proposed only removal of the IUD, and others have recommended removal of the IUD and a course of antibiotics. If the patient is asymptomatic, removal of the IUD is usually followed by sloughing of the superficial infected tissue with menstruation. A second IUD may be inserted later, although a change in contraceptive technique should be considered. If the use of an IUD is chosen, the woman should be followed closely for the onset of pelvic symptoms and should be screened periodically with Papanicolaou smears for recolonization by *A. israelii*. The diagnosis of actinomycosis must be considered in patients who have persistent symptoms such as pain or a discharge after removal of an IUD. These patients should receive a course of antibiotic therapy and be followed for resolution of symptoms.Dr. Kalams: Up to 25 percent of IUDs eventually become colonized by actinomyces. It is estimated that 2 to 4 percent of the patients with colonization of an IUD subsequently have serious actinomycotic infections. In general, very few patients with proved actinomycotic infection have had an IUD in place for less than three years.\n",

      "question": "First admission.\nA sixty-year-old tombstone salesman was admitted to the hospital because of hemoptysis.\nTen years previously, after a statue that he was lifting toppled against his chest, he began to experience a sensation of tightness in the anterior portion of the chest, with radiation to both arms and aggravation by exertion. No abnormality was found on physical examination. At that time an electrocardiogram (\nFig. 1\n) showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 90; the ST segments were elevated in Leads 2, 3 and aVF, the T waves were inverted in Leads V\n1\nthrough V\n4\n, and a Q wave in Lead 3 and a small Q wave in Lead aVF were demonstrated. Nitroglycerin afforded relief of the discomfort, and an electrocardiogram taken a month later disclosed reversion to a normal pattern. Six years before admission he returned to the clinic because of pain in the chest of increasing frequency. An electrocardiogram disclosed a normal rhythm at a rate of 70; the T waves were flat in Leads 1 and V\n1\nand inverted in Leads aVR and aVL; a tiny R wave in Lead V\n1\nand a deep QS wave in Lead V\n2\nwere seen; the ST segments were slightly elevated in Leads 2, 3 and aVF and depressed in Leads V\n2\nthrough V\n4\n. The nitroglycerin therapy was resumed, and the symptoms again improved. Three years later he returned to the hospital because of the development of severe chest pain during heavy exertion. An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 75; the T waves were inverted in Leads 3, aVR and V1\n,\nand the ST segments were slightly depressed in Leads V\n3\nand V\n4\n; a small Q wave in Leads 2, 3 and aVF, a tiny R wave in Leads V\n1\nand V\n2\nand an rsR\u2032 wave in Lead V\n3\nwere evident. The glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) was 12 units, and the iron 140 microgm. per 100 ml. After discharge the patient was followed in the clinic and maintained on a regimen of chlorothiazide, nitroglycerin, digitalis and a diet low in sodium. Six months before entry there was the onset of a cough productive of several ounces of white sputum daily. He became anorectic and lost 10 pounds in weight. On the morning of admission he was awakened by a paroxysmal cough productive of several ounces of bloody sputum.\nHe had smoked 2 packages of cigarettes daily for many years and had frequently consumed small amounts of brandy for relief of the pain in the chest.\nPhysical examination revealed a cachectic man who appeared acutely ill. The cervical veins were not prominent. The lungs were clear except for rhonchi over the left-lower-lung field posteriorly. The heart was enlarged, extending to the anterior axillary line; the rhythm was regular, and a Grade 2 systolic murmur preceded by an atrial systolic gallop sound was heard at the cardiac apex. The edge of the liver was felt 2 fingerbreadths below the right costal margin; the spleen was not palpable. Rectal examination disclosed moderate enlargement of the prostate gland.\nThe temperature was 99\u00b0F., the pulse 72, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 150 systolic, 95 diastolic.\nThe urine gave a + + test for protein; the sediment contained 2 white cells and occasional red cells and hyaline casts per high-power field. The hematocrit was 45 per cent; the white-cell count was 7400, with 60 per cent neutrophils and 8 per cent band forms. The glucose was 75 mg., the urea nitrogen 26 mg., the calcium 8.4 mg., the phosphorus 2.9 mg., the conjugated (direct-reacting) bilirubin 0.8 mg., the total bilirubin 1.0 mg., and the protein 7.0 gm. (the albumin 4.0 gm., and the globulin 3.0 gm.) per 100 ml. The sodium was 137 milliequiv., the potassium 3.9 milliequiv., and the bicarbonate 25 milliequiv. per liter. The SGOT was 23 units, the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 124 units, and the alkaline phosphatase 2.3 Sigma units; the prothrombin content was 45 per cent. Culture of the sputum yielded an abundant growth of pneumococci. Cytologic examination of the sputum was negative for tumor cells on three occasions. A tuberculin skin test (intermediate-strength PPD) gave a weakly positive response. An electrocardiogram (\nFig. 2\n) showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 84; the PR interval was 0.21 second; the T waves were nearly isoelectric in Leads 1, 2, aVR, aVL and aVF, and the ST segments were slightly depressed in Leads V\n5\nand V\n6\n; there were small Q waves followed by splintered QRS complexes in Leads 2, 3 and aVF; tiny R waves were seen in Leads V\n1\nthrough V\n3\n, and there was a Q wave in Lead V\n4\n. X-ray films of the chest (\nFig. 3\n) revealed cardiac enlargement, principally in the region of the left ventricle; the lungs were congested, the hilar shadows were prominent, and a small pleural effusion was visible at the right-lung base.\nOn the third hospital day bronchoscopic examination disclosed bleeding from the bronchi of both lower lobes and possibly from the right-middle-lobe bronchus. On the seventh hospital day a transcricoid bronchographic examination revealed slight narrowing of the distal portion of the right intermediate bronchus and nonfilling of the bronchus to the superior segment of the right lower lobe; no evidence of bronchiectasis was seen. A laminagraphic examination confirmed the finding of slight narrowing of the right intermediate bronchus. Because of persistent rales over the left-lower-lung field further bronchoscopic examination was deferred, and the patient was discharged on the eleventh hospital day.\nSecond admission\n(five weeks later). He remained relatively well until one week before admission, when a respiratory infection developed, characterized by chilly sensations and a cough productive of white sputum. On the evening of admission there was the onset of a paroxysmal cough productive of blood.\nPhysical examination showed a thin man coughing up large amounts of blood. The cervical veins were not prominent. The breath sounds were diminished at the right-lung base, and inspiratory crackling rales were audible at both lung bases. The physical findings were otherwise unchanged; digital clubbing was not observed.\nThe temperature was 99\u00b0F., the pulse 108, and the respirations 28. The blood pressure was 130 systolic, 100 diastolic.\nThe urine gave a + + test for protein; the sediment contained many hyaline casts and 10 white cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 38 per cent; the white-cell count was 12,500, with a normal differential count. The prothrombin content was 82 per cent. An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 72; the PR interval was 0.22 second, and the voltage was low in the limb leads; the pattern was otherwise unchanged. X-ray films of the chest disclosed haziness in the region of the right-lower-lung field and right hilus.\nPenicillin and streptomycin were administered. The temperature per rectum rose to 101\u00b0F. daily. On the fourth hospital day bronchoscopic examination was attempted but abandoned because the blood pressure fell to 50 systolic after one minute of halothane anesthesia; after the administration of oxygen the blood pressure rose to 90 systolic, 60 diastolic. Four days later bronchoscopic examination was accomplished under local anesthesia; the right intermediate bronchus was minimally narrowed but otherwise normal, as were all the other major bronchi observed. Several biopsy specimens taken from the narrowed area showed no evidence of malignancy. On the eleventh hospital day a limited transcricoid bronchographic study (\nFig. 4\n) revealed a concentric, tapered narrowing of the right intermediate bronchus near the origin of the right-middle-lobe and superior-segment bronchi; the latter was not filled by contrast material. On the same day the conjugated bilirubin was 3.5 mg., and the total bilirubin 4.4 mg. per 100 ml. The SGOT was 77 units, and the bromsulfalein retention 32 per cent in forty-five minutes. The hemoptyses subsided, and the patient was discharged on the seventeenth hospital day.\nFinal admission\n(three weeks later). In the interim progressive orthopnea and ankle edema developed, and diarrhea occurred. The productive cough persisted.\nPhysical examination showed a thin, chronically ill man. Moist inspiratory rales were audible at both lung bases. The heart was markedly enlarged, and a Grade 2 apical systolic murmur was heard. The edge of the liver was felt 1 fingerbreadth below the right costal margin; the spleen was not palpable. There was + + peripheral edema.\nThe temperature was 98\u00b0F., the pulse 90, and the respirations 20. The blood pressure was 110 systolic, 85 diastolic; there was no pulsus paradoxus.\nThe urine was normal except for an occasional hyaline cast, red cell and white cell per high-power field in the sediment. The hematocrit was 44 per cent, and the white-cell count 12,200. The glucose was 87 mg., the creatinine 1.3 mg., the conjugated bilirubin 1.9 mg., the total bilirubin 2.2 mg., and the protein 6.4 gm. (the albumin 2.9 gm., and the globulin 3.5 gm.) per 100 ml. The SGOT was 20 units, the LDH 130 units, and the alkaline phosphatase 1.7 Sigma units. The sodium was 118 milliequiv., the potassium 4.4 milliequiv., and the bicarbonate 22 milliequiv. per liter. The cephalin-flocculation test was negative at twenty-four hours and + at forty-eight hours. Culture of the sputum yielded a moderate growth of aerobacter. An electrocardiogram disclosed a normal rhythm at a rate of 86; the PR interval was 0.22 second; the axis was more vertical than on the previous tracing, and there were minor T-wave changes of no diagnostic significance. X-ray films of the chest (\nFig. 5\n) showed no change in the size of the heart; mild pulmonary congestion was evident, the pulmonary arteries were engorged, and the right pleural effusion was larger.\nDigitoxin, chlorothiazide, ammonium chloride and meralluride (Mercuhydrin) were given. The temperature ranged between 96 and 98\u00b0F. during the first week, and the cough and dyspnea persisted. On the seventh hospital day the temperature per rectum rose to 101\u00b0F., and the sputum became bloody. Dullness and diminished breath sounds were heard at the right-lung base. The white-cell count was 17,500. Culture of the sputum yielded a moderate growth of\nStaphylococcus aureus.\nAn x-ray film of the chest showed no change in the size of the heart and persistence of the right pleural effusion; a hazy density obscured the right-lower-lung field. Penicillin and chloramphenicol were added to the therapeutic regimen. With restriction of water intake and the administration of supplemental sodium by mouth the sodium rose to 133 milliequiv. per liter. The temperature remained in the range of 100 to 101\u00b0F., and the production of bloody sputum continued. On the twenty-third hospital day the urea nitrogen was 66 mg., and the bilirubin 2.8 mg. per 100 ml. An electrocardiogram (\nFig. 6\n) showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 70; the PR interval was 0.16 second; the T waves were inverted in Leads aVR, aVL and V\n1\nthrough V\n4\n, and the ST segments were elevated in Leads 1, 2 and V\n1\nthrough V\n6\n. On the following day an electrocardiogram showed reversion to the pattern demonstrated on admission except for variation of the PR interval between 0.22 and 0.30 second. Digitoxin was withheld, and the PR interval returned to 0.22 second. The patient continued to cough up blood-tinged sputum and died suddenly on the twenty-eighth hospital day.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Donald B. Martin\\*: Ten years before admission, at the age of fifty years, this man had trauma to the chest followed by discomfort in the chest and a transient abnormality of the electrocardiographic pattern. A number of electrocardiograms were taken during the ten-year period. Dr. McNeely, will you help us in their interpretation?\\*Assistant in medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital; associate in medicine, Harvard Medical School.Dr. William F. McNeely: The first electrocardiogram ([Fig. 1](#f001)), taken shortly after the injury to the chest, shows moderate elevation of the ST segments in Leads 2, 3 and aVF, with a Q wave in Lead 3 and a small Q wave in Lead aVF. The T waves in the first four precordial leads are inverted. We do not have the follow-up tracing that was taken a month later and interpreted as normal.Dr. Martin: Does the report that it was normal provide any hint about the etiology of the abnormality shown on the first tracing? Is it compatible with anterolateral injury?Dr. McNeely: We see signs of anteroinferior injury and loss of muscle that might be due to coronary-artery disease or conceivably to trauma. The pattern can revert to normal in either event.Dr. Martin: Even without scarring?Dr. McNeely: Without any residual abnormality that one can see in the electrocardiogram. On the second tracing, taken four years later when the patient returned to the hospital because of pain in the chest, we find only slight ST-segment elevation in Leads 2, 3 and aVF. In the precordial leads the pattern has changed in that there is now only a tiny and questionable R wave in Leads V1 and V2. This pattern is consistent with an anteroseptal myocardial scar. There are several intervening tracings, which demonstrate very little change. The electrocardiogram taken three years before entry still shows a tiny R wave in Leads V1 through V3 and a Q wave in Lead V4 \u2014 in other words, persistence of the suggestion of an anteroseptal scar. The voltage in the standard limb leads is lower. The tracing taken on admission ([Fig. 2](#f002)) is well standardized through all the leads, and we again notice a Q wave in Lead 3 as well as splintering of the QRS complex in Lead aVF, raising the question of an inferior myocardial scar or perhaps, in view of this combination, an apical scar with extension to the anteroseptal surface. Two subsequent electrocardiograms demonstrate prolongation of the PR interval.The tracing taken on the twenty-third day of the final admission ([Fig. 6](#f006)) is radically different from all the preceding and subsequent electrocardiograms. The very slight ST-segment elevation in Leads 2, 3 and aVF persists, and small Q waves are still visible in Leads 3 and aVF. Across the anterior surface, in Leads V1 through V4, however, we now observe tiny R waves, ST-segment elevation and late inversion of the T waves. Some ST-segment elevation is evident in Leads V5 and V6. This pattern is also consistent with acute injury to the anteroseptal surface. On the final electrocardiogram, taken on the following day, these changes have reverted to approximately the same pattern that was demonstrated previously. The voltage in the precordial leads is slightly low, and in the standard limb leads it is distinctly low.Dr. Martin: Before proceeding to the discussion I should like to review the x-ray films, especially the bronchographic examination of the right bronchial tree.Dr. Frederick S. Tomchik: The five examinations of the chest performed over the three-month period before the patient died show similar findings. The films taken during the first admission ([Fig. 3](#f003)) show a considerably enlarged heart; the enlargement seems to involve all the chambers, but the left ventricle is by far the largest. Severe left ventricular failure is indicated on all five examinations by prominence of the pulmonary vessels and by horizontal streaks in the lower lung fields laterally, reflecting congestion of the pulmonary lymphatics and interlobular septums. The positions of the major and minor fissures rule out a significant change in the volume of any of the lobes, and no definite localized parenchymal process is visible. The films taken on the first admission reveal only a trace of pleural fluid on the right side. Those taken on the final admission ([Fig. 5](#f005)) demonstrate a moderate increase in the pleural fluid, with much of it lying beneath the diaphragmatic surface of the lung. The final film, which was taken with the patient supine, reveals a homogeneous hazy density that corresponds roughly to the distribution of the right lower lobe, raising the possibility of right-lower-lobe consolidation, but the same appearance could be produced by layering of the pleural fluid in the posteroinferior portion of the chest because of the supine position. The right lower lobe is unchanged, and the minor fissure remains in the normal position.The films from the first bronchographic examination show no diagnostic changes. There is a relative lack of filling of the subsegmental bronchi, which is a finding typical of bronchiectasis, but the segmental bronchi of the left lower lobe taper fairly well, and those of the right lower lobe appear normal. The changes demonstrated on this examination are not sufficient to permit a diagnosis of bronchiectasis. The distal portion of the right intermediate bronchus is minimally narrowed. Perhaps the most significant finding is the lack of filling of the bronchus to the superior segment of the right lower lobe, which should arise posteriorly approximately opposite the orifice of the middle-lobe bronchus. On the spot films of this area from the second bronchographic examination ([Fig. 4](#f004)), seven weeks later, the narrowing of the lower portion of the right intermediate bronchus is more pronounced and more ragged. On several spot films there appears to be an irregular filling defect along the medial wall of the narrowed segment, and below it we find slight irregular dilatation of one or two basal segmental bronchi. The middle-lobe bronchus appears normal. Again, the bronchus to the superior segment of the right lower lobe is not filled.Dr. Martin: Does that finding indicate an intrinsic bronchial lesion rather than external pressure?Dr. Tomchik: The fact that the lumen appears constricted both medially and laterally is against extrinsic compression. This seems to be a lesion intrinsically involving the wall of the bronchus, if indeed it is a true lesion. Occasionally, an adherent blood clot produces a similar appearance.Dr. Martin: For the purpose of discussion I shall divide the case into two parts: the initial traumatic event with the concurrent electrocardiographic changes; and the events leading up to the patient's death. Parenthetically, I should like to comment about the environmental background. This man was a salesman of tombstones. The only occupational disease that might be attributed to this profession is silicosis, which presumably can be excluded in this case. One other environmental factor to be stressed is the history of smoking 2 packages of cigarettes a day for many years.In regard to the initial electrocardiogram in terms of the trauma to the chest, there has been recent interest in post-traumatic pericarditis. Dr. McNeely, is it within the realm of possibility that this pattern resulted from pericarditis rather than actual injury to the anterior part of the heart?Dr. McNeely: Not from pericarditis alone.Dr. Martin: In a recent review of 50 cases from the Johns Hopkins Hospital Tabatznik and Isaacs[1](#core-r001) likened this syndrome to the pericarditis and pleuritis that are sometimes sequelae of myocardial infarction or cardiotomy. The symptoms and signs include fever and pain that is accentuated by breathing and bending of the torso. A friction rub is often heard over the precordium. If the trauma is great enough a pericardial effusion develops, and even hemopericardium and tamponade may occur. In addition, there may be a pleural effusion. Of the 50 patients in that series, 68 per cent recovered in two weeks, 10 per cent had an increase in the effusion in the second week of the illness and then recovered, and 22 per cent had repeated effusions lasting for six to thirty weeks. All but 2 patients recovered, and it is of interest that in those cases constrictive pericarditis developed and required surgical intervention. Since Dr. McNeely pointed out that there was evidence of inferior myocardial injury as well we can exclude such a disorder in this case. I am confident that the pain on effort that was relieved by nitroglycerin was angina pectoris.A critical point in this case occurred when a right-sided chest lesion became apparent, and the evidence of congestive heart failure became more marked. In discussing this aspect of the problem I shall first mention the pulmonary lesion, proceed to the cardiac lesion and then try to effect a marriage of the two. The borderline changes indicated by the tests of liver function are compatible with congestive heart failure. The bilirubin level, which was higher than one would expect with congestive heart failure alone, might be attributed in part to the presence of blood in the chest or possibly to the halothane anesthesia. I shall also account for the intermittent proteinuria and occasional red cells, white cells and hyaline casts in the urine on the basis of cardiac failure.With regard to the pulmonary lesion, my initial thought was that the pressure on the bronchus was extrinsic, but after reviewing the films with Dr. Tomchik I am convinced that the bronchial lesion was intrinsic. Although Dr. Tomchik intimates that the bronchial deformity might have been due to a clot, that possibility seems unlikely in view of its progression over the seven-week period. It also seems improbable that it was an old inflammatory lesion, perhaps of tuberculous origin, that was causing chronic inflammation, cicatrix formation and stenosis. A diagnosis that deserves mention because it could establish a relation between the pulmonary and cardiac lesions is a carcinoid tumor with concurrent cardiac involvement. However, although carcinoid tumors are usually intrinsic they are never concentric around a bronchus. In view of the history of years of smoking 2 packages of cigarettes a day and the hemoptysis, weight loss and cachexia, bronchogenic carcinoma seems the best explanation. Was a thoracentesis performed? A biopsy of the bronchus was done, but were tumor cells sought in the pleural fluid?Dr. Benjamin Castleman: A thoracentesis yielded 200 ml. of fluid that contained 1100 white cells and 38,000 red cells, but cytologic study was not done.Dr. Martin: As far as the cardiac problem is concerned, I believe that the patient had coronary-artery disease, as indicated by the initial series of electrocardiograms and the pain on effort with relief by nitroglycerin. However, the possibility of a superimposed myocardial disease should be considered to account for the final illness. The distinction between so-called primary myocardial disease and coronary-artery disease can be very difficult on clinical grounds. In the category of primary myocardial disease I include chronic myocarditis, myocardial fibroelastosis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis and glycogen-storage disease. For information about primary myocardial disease I have drawn heavily from the reviews by Mattingly,[2](#core-r002) Dye et al.,[3](#core-r003) Bridgen,[4](#core-r004) Burchell[5](#core-r005) and Burwell and Robin.[6](#core-r006) For the most part the symptoms are those of progressive congestive heart failure, consisting principally of weakness, fatigue and exertional dyspnea. In addition, as was stressed in a report from this hospital,[7](#core-r007) emboli to both the pulmonary and the systemic circulation are not rare. The course is often terminated by unexpected sudden death. Precordial pain is not a common symptom in these patients. If pain is present it is usually due to embolization to various organs, and sometimes there is pain in the right upper quadrant resulting from hepatic congestion due to congestive heart failure. X-ray films of the chest in such cases reveal marked, nonspecific cardiomegaly and sometimes suggest pericardial disease. The electrocardiograms may show low voltage, and there is a high frequency of arrhythmias and cardiac conduction disorders.Now, I shall attempt to tie together the cardiac and pulmonary lesions. Before seeing the x-ray films and becoming convinced that the bronchial lesion was intrinsic, I thought of a number of diseases that might produce an extrinsic bronchial mass and also involve the heart, including sarcoidosis with sarcoid heart disease and myeloma with amyloid heart disease. I shall skip over these possibilities, however, and narrow the field to three diagnoses, two of which can probably also be excluded. The possibility of tuberculosis is suggested by the presence of a chronic bronchial process, and one might postulate spread of the disease to the pericardium and myocardium, aggravating the congestive heart failure terminally. In the series of cases of tuberculous pericarditis reviewed by Spodick[8](#core-r008) and Schepers[9](#core-r009) dyspnea was emphasized as the prominent symptom, and substernal pain, cough and the systemic symptoms of fever, malaise and anorexia were also observed. Both authors stressed that the physical signs often, but by no means always, included a pericardial friction rub and a pericardial effusion. Dr. Tomchik, do you see any evidence of a pericardial effusion on the x-ray films?Dr. Tomchik: The contour of the cardiac shadow does not suggest it.Dr. Martin: Carcinoid heart disease, which would provide an explanation of both the cardiac and the pulmonary lesions, as I mentioned, also seems extremely unlikely. Roberts and Sjoerdsma[10](#core-r010) recently reported 17 patients with the carcinoid syndrome with cardiac involvement, and it is noteworthy that 3 of those patients had involvement of the left side of the heart as well as the right. Reference was made to a report of 1 patient with a left-sided lesion only, and, interestingly enough, the carcinoid tumor in that case was bronchial.The only diagnosis that I can invoke that will provide an explanation for both the pulmonary lesion and the aggravation of the congestive heart failure is invasion of the pericardium and heart by a bronchogenic tumor. The subject of tumors that spread to the heart was reviewed by Gassman et al.[11](#core-r011) and by Cohen et al.[12](#core-r012) about ten years ago. The two most common types of malignant tumor that involved the pericardium and heart in the cases they reported were bronchogenic and breast carcinomas. Less common, but more frequent than any of the other types, were lymphoma and melanoma. In these series the prominent symptoms were those of congestive heart failure. Among the 17 patients reported by Gassman et al., 7 had refractory heart failure, 10 had left ventricular or nonspecific cardiac enlargement, and 5 had a pericardial effusion. Among the 65 patients reported by Cohen et al., 26 had congestive heart failure, 14 had a pericardial effusion, and 15 had an arrhythmia. Low voltage was shown on the electrocardiogram in a large number of the cases.With some trepidation, I shall propose that this man had coronary-artery disease aggravated by cancerous invasion of the heart and pericardium. My diagnoses, therefore, are bronchogenic carcinoma, with metastases to the heart and pericardium, coronary-artery disease and right-lower-lobe pneumonia terminally.Dr. Edgar Haber: To what do you attribute the acute changes shown on the preterminal electrocardiogram? Are they to your way of thinking manifestations of neoplastic pericarditis or a reflection of an acute episode in the long history of coronary-artery disease?Dr. Martin: The reversion on the next day, with some dampening of the voltage, and the absence of more definite evidence of scarring suggest that the changes may have reflected a metastatic process rather than coronary-artery disease.Dr. Haber: That is the obvious interpretation, but I am a little uncomfortable about it. The development of scarring in an area that already has lost most of its capacity to produce electric potential doesn't mean very much. The fact that the ST-segment and T-wave vectors are at an angle of nearly 180\u00b0 to one another in the horizontal plane is against an epicardial process such as pericarditis. I wonder whether in addition to all the other insults this man had an acute myocardial infarction terminally.Dr. Martin: In point of fact, there is no mention of pain at that time. I agree that the pattern is entirely consistent with coronary-artery disease, but I would expect the patient to have complained of pain unless he was obtunded.Dr. Haber: Do the clinicians who took care of him recall whether he was sufficiently alert during the last few days to report pain?Dr. Peter Block: He was not obtunded.Dr. Jacob Lerman: Dr. Martin, how do you explain the jaundice and impaired liver function? The patient didn't have sufficient right-sided heart failure to account for it.Dr. Martin: The right-sided heart failure may have been the reason for the mildly aberrant findings on the tests of hepatic function such as the brom-sulfalein retention and lactic dehydrogenase values. The presence of changed blood in the chest may have contributed to the hyperbilirubinemia.Dr. Castleman: Where in the chest?Dr. Martin: On one occasion, for example, there was hemorrhage from several bronchi.Dr. Lerman: Excessive bilirubin occurs when there is blood in the serous cavity, but when blood is coming from a bronchus it flows so fast that there isn't much chance for hemolysis to take place.Dr. Martin: Do you have a better explanation?Dr. Lerman: I wonder about pulmonary infarction as the cause of the jaundice.Dr. Martin: Pulmonary embolism is a feature of the primary myocardial syndromes, especially fibroelastosis, and should be considered in any patient with congestive heart failure who fails to improve, but in this case there is no support for a diagnosis of pulmonary emboli on the x-ray films or the electrocardiograms or in terms of serum enzymatic changes.Dr. Daniel S. Ellis: There was little evidence of liver disease, and I agree with the interpretation that Dr. Lerman suggested. The most common cause of jaundice in a patient with chronic congestive heart failure under these circumstances is multiple pulmonary infarcts.Dr. Castleman: Do you think, then, that the hemoptyses could be explained by pulmonary infarcts?Dr. Ellis: Yes, they could. However, the bronchograms are convincing, and I believe that the patient had a bronchial tumor as well as multiple pulmonary infarcts.Dr. Edwin P. Maynard, III: Since there had been multiple biopsies of the narrowed area in the bronchus, perhaps some of the irregularity demonstrated on the final bronchographic study was secondary to the biopsies and therefore misleading. The patient may simply have had extensive coronary-artery disease, with congestive heart failure and hepatic congestion and probably with pulmonary infarcts causing the hemoptyses.Dr. Castleman: Wasn't the obstruction demonstrated on the first bronchographic study?Dr. Tomchik: There was no obstruction, actually. The narrowing apparently was present at that time, and certainly the nonfilling of the superior segmental bronchus of the right lower lobe is evident on the films from the first examination.Dr. Walter T. St. Goar: Dr. Martin, what are your thoughts about the fall in the serum sodium level?Dr. Martin: It probably reflected worsening of the congestive heart failure. Subsequently, there was a rise in the blood urea nitrogen level, presumably with a decreased glomerular filtration rate, perhaps because of overzealous treatment of the congestive heart failure.Dr. Castleman: Dr. Tomchik, if the patient had sufficient involvement of the pericardium by a cancer of the lung to produce the low voltage shown on the electrocardiograms, wouldn't one see evidence of hilar lymphadenopathy on the x-ray films? By the time we see pericardial metastases the lymph nodes are usually involved.Dr. Tomchik: Not necessarily. A bronchial tumor would have to grow medially only a short distance to involve the pericardium by direct extension. I detect no sign of pericardial involvement on the films in this case. On all the films the cardiac contour is smooth, with no nodularity, and a pericardial effusion is not obvious.Dr. James R. Carter, Jr.: The majority of the students agreed with Dr. Martin on a diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma in a patient with arteriosclerotic heart disease and chronic congestive heart failure. There were two dissenters to this opinion, one of whom was the discusser.Mr. George Gewirtz: I believed that he had multiple pulmonary emboli and infarcts secondary to thrombophlebitis in the leg and arteriosclerotic heart disease. My second choice was bronchogenic carcinoma.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Castleman: At autopsy the most striking finding was in the right side of the chest, which contained a liter of fluid. As suggested by Dr. Lerman and Dr. Ellis, huge pulmonary infarcts involved almost the entire right lower lobe, the middle lobe and part of the upper lobe ([Fig. 7](#f007)). In the left lung we found fairly extensive emphysema as well as a few infarcts, which were more recent than some of the infarcts in the right lung. The infarcts were of various ages, and some of them were fairly old, with organization of the emboli and recanalization, presumably dating back to the original episode of hemoptysis.The heart was enlarged, and there was, as was predicted from the electrocardiograms, an old anteroseptal infarct ( [Fig. 8](#f008) ). In the left ventricle we also found mural thrombi, which were quite old and in some areas adherent to the interstices of the trabeculae carneae, where the wall was thinned as a result of the infarct. Extension of the septal infarct almost through into the right ventricle at some time in the past was indicated by the presence of a mural thrombus in the apex of the right ventricle, and on microscopical examination of a section cut through this septum we found extensive fibrosis. As was expected, there was severe coronary-artery disease. In addition, we found evidence of a small acute myocardial infarct, as suggested by Dr. Haber. The pericardial sac contained 300 ml. of clear fluid, which may have been responsible for some of the electrocardiographic changes, including the low voltage. From the mural thrombus in the left chamber there had been emboli to the kidney, some of them fairly recent. There was also severe atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta, with occlusion of one of the iliac arteries. Since the peripheral veins were patent and free of thrombosis, we assume that the pulmonary emboli originated in the right ventricle. The liver was involved by very severe chronic passive congestion ([Fig. 9](#f009)), and I believe that the jaundice can be ascribed to the combination of the severe infarction in the lungs and the chronic passive congestion in the liver, as Dr. Ellis suggested.Dr. Tomchik was correct in his interpretation that the changes shown on the bronchograms indicated an intrinsic lesion. The cause of the nonfilling of the bronchus to the superior segment of the right lower lobe was a large, necrotic, localized squamous-cell carcinoma ([Fig. 10](#f010)). There were no metastases from this tumor, which was merely a localized smoker's cancer. I assume that the hemoptysis came from both sources. Such severe hemoptysis is unusual as the result of carcinoma of the lung alone, which generally causes just spitting of blood.Dr. Lerman: The amount of hemorrhage in this case is better explained on the basis of pulmonary emboli than a small tumor.\n",
      "response": "Coronary-artery disease, with myocardial infarction, old and recent, and mural thrombi, both ventricles.\nPulmonary infarcts, massive, right.\nSquamous-cell carcinoma of lung, right lower lobe.\nChronic passive congestion and necrosis of liver, with jaundice.\nPulmonary emphysema.\nRenal infarct."

      "question": "A fifty-eight-year-old Italian, para IV widow entered the hospital because of vaginal bleeding.\nTen years before admission the patient passed through a relatively uneventful menopause and had no further bleeding until six months before entry, when she suddenly began to spot. This spotting lasted five days and then disappeared completely. She had a similar episode of bleeding two months before admission, which also lasted five days, and then a third episode a month later. There was no associated vaginal discharge or pain and no other symptoms. There was no history of estrogen medication.\nHer catamenia had begun at twelve years of age, and her menstrual periods were always regular. She had had a gall-bladder operation fifteen years previously and a second abdominal operation, for some unknown reason, a few years later.\nPhysical examination showed a markedly obese woman. Examination of the heart and lungs was negative. The abdomen was so obese that no masses could be made out. There was a scar in the right upper quadrant.\nThe blood pressure was 135 systolic, 85 diastolic. The temperature, pulse and respirations were normal.\nExamination of the urine was negative. The blod showed a hemoglobin of 13 gm. and a white-cell count of 6500, with 63 per cent neutrophils. A vaginal examination was not remarkable.\nAn operation was performed on the second hospital day. Under anesthesia, a grapefruit-sized abdominal mass was palpated, on the left side above the pelvic brim, but could be pushed across the midline to the right side. The uterine curettings were not grossly abnormal.\nA laparotomy was then performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Howard Ulfelder: The history is that of an obese woman who had her menopause ten years before, who was essentially well in all other respects, who had recurrent episodes of vaginal bloody spotting for six months prior to operation and who, under anesthesia, proved to have a movable mass the size of a grapefruit.I think it might be useful in this particular case to single out the two outstanding findings and run over the differential diagnosis of each one. The first one, of course, is post-menopausal vaginal bleeding. A common cause for this \u2014 in fact, the most common cause nowadays \u2014 is exposure to the action of estrogens. We are told that this patient was not given estrogen medication; we must not overlook the fact that she may have been producing her own estrogen. There are ovarian tumors that make estrogen in large quantities. These are the granulosa cell tumor and the thecoma. Certain other ovarian tumors also produce small quantities of estrogen \u2014 even papillary cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary occasionally has associated endometrial bleeding without a malignant lesion of the endometrium.A second cause for post-menopausal vaginal bleeding is a tumor of the uterus. This may be either malignant \u2014 carcinoma of the uterine fundus or of the cervix \u2014 or benign \u2014 a uterine polyp. There are a number of other causes of post-menopausal bleeding. A common one is the senile change frequently noted in the vagina. Senile vaginitis is frequently associated with bloody spotting. It is usually also associated with some degree of vaginal discharge and local irritation. Some people believe that there are senile changes in the endometrium corresponding to this visible change in the vaginal mucous membrane, and it has occasionally been postulated that bleeding from a senile endometrium or endometritis can occur just as we see bleeding from senile vaginitis. This has never been proved. Occasionally, in hypertension, we find post-menopausal vaginal bleeding explained on no other basis. This has been described as uterine apoplexy. It is a concept that is not very strongly held by anyone today but is occasionally mentioned and should be included in the differential diagnosis of this condition.Blood dyscrasias, of course, can produce bleeding from the uterus as from any other part of the body, and they must be considered. And, finally, there is a group of patients in whom no explanation is ever found for the post-menopausal vaginal bleeding. Unfortunately this is a rather large group. The present state of our knowledge about this symptom is such that there are many patients in whom the most thorough study fails to reveal any cause for post-menopausal bleeding.Some diagnoses that I have mentioned may be excluded on the basis of the protocol. This patient did not have hypertension. Blood dyscrasia was certainly not noticeable in the report.Let us turn now to the differential diagnosis of the abdominal mass, and then let us see if there is any one diagnosis that will explain both these findings. An abdominal mass that appears to be freely movable, in a patient such as this, may be an ovarian cyst or tumor. I will not go into a classification of ovarian tumors here. A pedunculated fibroid could produce such a mass, and so could a cyst of the mesentery, carcinoma of the bowel and, finally, the spleen. Spleens are occasionally on a very long pedicle and may be found anywhere in the abdomen.Is there any diagnosis that would explain both the post-menopausal bleeding and the presence of a movable mass in the abdomen? Ovarian tumors or cysts that produce estrogen and in turn cause growth of the endometrium and bleeding from it should by definition produce endometrium. I am very much interested in the statement that the uterine curettings were not grossly abnormal. In a woman ten years past the menopause, who has received no estrogen therapy by mouth or parenterally, that statement should mean that there were no uterine curettings, and I should like to ask, if it is a fair question, whether there were curettings at all or whether this statement means that there were curettings but they were not grossly abnormal.Dr. Marshall K. Bartlett: There was a moderate amount of tissue that appeared as a result of curettage.Dr. Ulfelder: The statement that the uterine curettings were not grossly abnormal means, then, that this did not look like a malignant lesion of the uterine fundus. Were the curettings similar to those ordinarily seen in the pre-menopausal woman?Dr. Bartlett: Essentially the same, I believe.Dr. Ulfelder: That very definitely raises the possibility that this patient was making estrogen and therefore growing an endometrium. However, one can get from the post-menopausal uterus material that is reported later by the pathologist as showing atrophic endometrium. If one curettes carefully, I am sure it is always possible to get a little something, although occasionally we see nothing at all.A possible diagnosis therefore in this case is a tumor of the ovary, which made estrogen and caused secondary development of endometrium in this post-menopausal uterus. Such a tumor would be either a granulosa cell or a thecoma or, less likely, a papillary cystadenoma. Carcinoma of the uterus and polyp of the endometrium should have been detected in the curettings, probably grossly. If senile changes had been noted in the vaginal mucous membrane they would have been described in the protocol, particularly since that must have been in the operator's mind as a possible explanation for the bleeding when he examined this patient. Fibroid could explain the mass but not the bleeding. Fibroids of the uterus do not produce bleeding in the post-menopausal woman.The only diagnosis I can see that will explain both findings on the basis of one lesion is an estrogen-producing tumor of the ovary, with growth of the endometrium secondary to it. There is one other possible explanation for her bleeding, which I neglected to mention, and that is resumption of normal menstruation. You will note from the protocol that there was some rhythmicity to this woman's bleeding, and that the bleeding was somewhat like periods in that it took place for about five days and then ceased altogether until the next episode. I recall no case in which this has occurred as long as ten years after a cessation of periods on physiologic grounds. I think it is not uncommon for women to have a period or two, as long as eighteen to twenty months after the cessation of periods, but I think that is a most unlikely explanation for the bleeding in this woman after this long interval.Endocrine-producing tumors of the ovary are rare, and one has to make, therefore, a rare diagnosis, to explain both these findings on the basis of one lesion. It is so rare that I think it is unlikely in this patient. I think it is more likely that these two findings were not associated. I think she had a mass, and I think she had post-menopausal bleeding. I think the post-menopausal bleeding probably will not be explained, and I think the mass was an entirely independent condition. I would consider a spleen as the most likely mass in this patient. The mass was rather high on the left side, and when it was displaced, it was displaced to the right but not down. I am also interested in the statement that the pelvic examination was not remarkable. I think I will \"stick my neck out\" and say that this patient had a wandering spleen, that she did not have any good explanation for post-menopausal bleeding, and that it is possible, but not likely, that she had an estrogen-producing tumor of the ovary.Dr. Tracy B. Mallory: Is there any further comment? Dr. Bartlett, I wonder if you would tell us what you found at operation.Dr. Bartlett: This case was a good example to me of the value of re-examining the abdomen under anesthesia, because this woman had a really sizable mass, \u2014 I think \"grapefruit size\" is a fair description of it, \u2014 and yet we had all completely missed it. The mass was easily felt under anesthesia, and it seemed to be symmetrical and smooth. Although when first felt it was in the left side of the abdomen it could very easily be rolled across into the right side, off into the right gutter, so to speak, and then back again. It seemed to lie a little more easily on the left than on the right, and on bimanual examination we were not able to make out any connection with the uterus. We could move the abdominal mass, so far as we could tell, without moving the uterus, but one must not forget that this was a very obese patient. This examination under ether gave us the information on which to decide to do a laparotomy, and when that was done it was apparent that the mass was a cyst arising in the left ovary on a long, stretched-out pedicle. It was of the size described and was smooth on the outside, with a moderately thick wall but with no external projections on it. The tubes and the other ovary were not unusual. The uterus was somewhat larger than one would expect after the menopause but again was not definitely beyond normal limits. A total hysterectomy was carried out, both tubes and ovaries being removed.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Mallory: The specimen Dr. Bartlett removed was a soft, fluctuant tumor mass, which looked and felt like a cyst. On cutting across it, we found that there were cystic areas and also solid tumor foci. One of the cystic areas contained some almost cheesy material. There were also shaggy, papillary masses projecting into the cyst. From the gross examination we thought that it was probably a papillary cystadenoma of the ovary, and were considerably surprised when the microscopical sections came through to find that the solid portions of the tumor showed a very characteristic, unmistakable pattern of granulosa cell tumor. The endometrium was not obviously hyperplastic. There was slight cystic dilatation of some of the glands, but the epithelium was fairly tall, and was not of the atrophic type seen in the senile cystic endometrium. There was a very mild hyperplasia present.Are there any questions that anyone would care to ask?Dr. Alfred Kranes: I still do not understand why Dr. Ulfelder started what sounded like a perfectly logical diagnosis, but because of its rarity, made a rarer diagnosis.Dr. Ulfelder: In my experience a wandering spleen is less rare than granulosa cell tumor.Dr. Kranes: Really?Dr. Mallory: I will certainly back up Dr. Ulfelder in his statement that when uterine cancer is excluded we are unable to find any pathological reason for post-menopausal bleeding in the majority of cases when we are supplied with the ovaries and uterus.Dr. Bartlett: Dr. Mallory, would this endometrium be unusual, in a case of unexplained postmenopausal bleeding?Dr. Mallory: I do not believe there was enough change in it so that I would have probably picked it up, if I had been given the curettings alone. I do not believe I would have made a diagnosis of hyperplasia, and I would not have suspected at all strongly granulosa cell tumor. Sometimes, when there is frank hyperplasia, we have been able to suggest the diagnosis on the basis of curettage.\n",

      "question": "A 22-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of severe headaches.\nShe was well until 11 months earlier, when she awoke with nuchal pain that radiated intermittently to either arm and sometimes to the second and third fingers on either side, with local tenderness in the posterior portion of the neck. She was seen by a chiropractor, without benefit, and was treated by an acupuncturist, without improvement during the next few months, which she spent in Togo and Ghana as part of her dance studies. She experienced one migraine headache during her stay in Africa, but no fever or diarrhea occurred; she swam once in fresh water, occasionally drank well water, and ate salads that had been washed with untreated water. Eight months before entry the pain gradually became constant and increasingly severe. Another chiropractor obtained x-ray films of the neck and reported an abnormality of the sixth cervical vertebra, but adjustments and ultra-sound treatments gave no relief.\nThree-and-a-half months before admission the patient came to this hospital, where physical examination was negative. The hematocrit was 37.2 percent; the white-cell count was 5700, with 13 percent neutrophils, 2 percent band forms, 48 percent lymphocytes, 14 percent monocytes, 22 percent eosinophils, and 1 percent basophils. The platelet count was 332,000, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 47 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 9 mg per 100 ml (3 mmol per liter), the bilirubin 0.2 mg per 100 ml (3 \u03bcmol per liter), and the protein 7.7 g (the albumin 4.2 g and the globulin 3.5 g) per 100 ml. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) was 12 U, the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 66 U, the amylase 186 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 43 U per liter. A test for antinuclear antibodies was negative. X-ray films of the cervical spine (\nFig. 1\n) showed increased density of the body and pedicles of the sixth cervical vertebra, with loss of height of the body. A tuberculin skin test (5 TU) and a skin test with candida antigen were negative, as was a serologic test for toxoplasmosis. A stool culture yielded no pathogenic microorganisms; examination of the stool on two occasions for ova and parasites was negative. The patient declined an x-ray film of the chest and stated that she would permit only one additional diagnostic study. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the cervical spine (\nFig. 2\n) showed areas of increased and decreased density of the sixth cervical vertebral body, right pedicle and proximal lamina, and proximal left pedicle; no associated soft-tissue mass was present, and there was no cord compression. Three months before admission the patient consented to the performance of a radionuclide bone scan, which was obtained after the injection of\n99m\nTc methylene diphosphonate (\nFig. 3\n); the examination revealed multiple areas of markedly increased uptake in the sphenoid sinus or sphenoid bone, the sixth cervical vertebral body and possibly the seventh cervical body or spinous process, the anterior end of the left fifth rib, the left portion of the second lumbar vertebral body, the left acetabulum, and the first and second sacral vertebras. X-ray films of the skull disclosed increased density of the sphenoid bone around the sella turcica. An x-ray film of the ilium was reported to show a well-marginated sclerotic density in the supraacetabular portion of the left ilium. X-ray films of the lumbosacral spine revealed increased density and slight enlargement of the left pedicle of the second lumbar vertebra.\nThe patient denied focal neurologic symptoms, but three months before admission she had a single episode of feeling \"drugged,\" with \"drifting off in my thinking,\" \"ideas and experiences racing through my mind,\" and garbled speech for several hours while sunbathing on a beach. After much discussion the patient consented to the performance of a CT scan of the lumbar spine with a needle biopsy. The CT study, obtained between the first and third lumbar vertebras, was reported to disclose a left posterolateral lytic process that involved one third of the second lumbar vertebral body and had a sclerotic margin without a break in the cortex; there was no expansile appearance of the lumbar process. At this point the patient refused to undergo a biopsy. She did not comply with the recommended treatment, and her symptoms worsened. She did not keep several appointments at this hospital and reportedly sought medical advice elsewhere.\nTwo months before entry she began to have daily headaches that were initially similar to attacks of migraine that she had experienced in the past, with a visual aura and no relief from acetaminophen. The headaches worsened and became bilateral, and she discontinued her studies of dancing because of increasing neck pain. She was admitted to the hospital.\nThe patient was right-handed and a lacto-ovovegetarian. There was a history of allergic asthma in childhood, with the receipt of hyposensitization treatment; she denied asthma in recent years. During the three years before entry she had typical migraine headaches, which apparently had been bilateral in the past and were preceded by visual auras of flashing white lights in one or the other side of the visual field. Two therapeutic abortions had been performed. She lost 6.8 kg during the 6 to 12 months before entry. She had received typhoid and yellow fever vaccines and gamma globulin before her visit to Africa and took chloroquine during her stay there; one fellow traveler contracted amebic dysentery during the trip. The patient had two healthy cats at home. One of her recent headaches was followed by intermittent vertigo for a few minutes at a time during the next four days. There was no history of head trauma, convulsions, gustatory or olfactory auras, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, automatic behavior, weakness, ataxia, numbness, fever, sweats, diarrhea, bladder or bowel dysfunction, breast masses, nausea, vomiting, or exposure to tuberculosis. The patient did not smoke, drank little alcohol, and denied the use of illicit drugs by any route.\nThe temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the pulse was 80, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared well. Examination of the head was negative except for 2 diopters of bilateral papilledema, without venous pulsations, hemorrhages, or exudates. The neck was supple; mild bony tenderness was noted over the lower cervical region. No lymphadenopathy was found. The lungs were clear except for diminished breath sounds at the right base. The heart, breasts, and abdomen were normal. There was no digital clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Rectal examination was negative, and a stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. On neurologic examination the patient was alert and oriented, with fluent speech. Cranial-nerve functions were normal despite the presence of papilledema. Motor examination showed no tremor or drift and normal bulk, tone, and strength. Sensation was intact to all modalities. Her gait was normal, including tandem gait, backward tandem gait, and walking on heels and toes. Coordination was well preserved. The tendon reflexes were ++ and equal, and the plantar responses were flexor.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 32.7 percent; the white-cell count was 3900, with 30 percent neutrophils, 38 percent lymphocytes, 11 percent monocytes, 18 percent eosinophils, and 3 percent basophils; the total eosinophil count was 728 per cubic millimeter. The platelet count was 390,000, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 81 mm per hour. The prothrombin time was 10.1 seconds, with a control of 10.9 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 33.7 seconds. The urea nitrogen was 11 mg per 100 ml (3.9 mmol per liter), the glucose 80 mg per 100 ml (4 mmol per liter), the calcium 9.0 mg per 100 ml (2.3 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 3.4 mg per 100 ml (1.1 mmol per liter), the uric acid 4.3 mg per 100 ml (0.26 mmol per 100 ml), the bilirubin 0.4 mg per 100 ml (7 \u03bcmol per liter), the cholesterol 111 mg per 100 ml (2.87 mmol per liter), and the protein 7.1 g per 100 ml. Serum electrophoresis revealed that the albumin was 49 percent, the alpha, globulin 3 percent, the alpha\n2\nglobulin 15 percent, the beta globulin 14 percent, and the gamma globulin 19 percent. The sodium was 139 mmol, the potassium 4.6 mmol, the chloride 102 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 27 mmol per liter. The SGOT was 14 U, the LDH 62 U, the creatine kinase (CK) 10 U, the amylase 297 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 81 U per liter; the heated alkaline phosphatase showed 40 percent residual activity. A test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. An electrocardiogram was normal.\nA CT scan of the brain taken on the day of admission with the intravenous injection of contrast material was reported to disclose a large, thick, ring-enhancing lesion in the left temporal lobe. The internal margin of the ring was irregular, and surrounding edema was present, with compression of the left ventricle and shift of the midline. A smaller area of increased absorptive values was noted in the right pons. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (\nFig. 4\n) confirmed the presence of a large necrotic left-temporal-lobe mass and a smaller pontine lesion. A CT scan of the spine performed on the second hospital day without the intravenous injection of contrast material was reported to reveal a diffuse osteolytic and osteosclerotic process that involved the sixth cervical vertebra, pedicle, and lamina. Posterior to the vertebral body there was a region of higher attenuation around the spinal canal, which was reported to suggest the possibility of epidural extension of the process. An osteolytic lesion surrounded by a sclerotic reaction was reported on the left side of the second and third lumbar vertebral bodies. The patient finally agreed to undergo an x-ray study of the chest (\nFig. 5\n), which showed a rounded, 3-cm soft-tissue mass at the superior margin of the right hilus within the medial segment of the right upper lobe and the anterior mediastinum; no evidence of calcification was observed; small bilateral pleural effusions were present. A diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. David M. Dawson\\*: This 22-year-old woman had an illness of slightly less than one year's duration. During that time cervical pain developed, followed by headache. A number of examinations were done over an extended period. The patient was not cooperative with the medical investigation, and there were long delays, which I assume were contrary to medical advice. In stepwise fashion it was discovered that she had multiple bony lesions that were located in thecervical and lumbar spine, the sphenoid bone, the pelvis, and the ribs. It was then found that she had a pulmonary mass in the medial segment of the right upper lobe. A CT scan of the head demonstrated a temporal-lobe mass on the left side as well as a doubtful lesion in the pons. Anemia, granulocytopenia, and a mild eosinophilia were found. During the early part of this illness she had traveled in Africa and had been exposed to potential pathogens there, since she went swimming in fresh water and ate improperly washed salads, and amebic infection occurred in a member of her group. She also had two cats at home. The history is negative in several important respects. During this 11-month illness lymphadenopathy apparently did not develop, and she had no enlargement of the liver or spleen, fever, or important degree of weight loss. Only late in the course was it necessary for her to give up her dancing career, principally because of her headaches.The case history leads to several areas of diagnostic interest. The presence of multiple bony lesions and an intracerebral mass raises the possibility of a metastatic tumor. The eosinophilia favors lymphoma over carcinoma. As we shall see, there are reasons to doubt a diagnosis of metastatic tumor, among them the patient's general good health and a number of negative studies.The travel in Africa raises the question of a parasitic infestation, specifically of schistosomiasis, amebic infection, and roundworm infestation. Although it is tempting to consider these possibilities, they are unlikely since the illness began before the trip to Africa and seems to have been a single illness throughout. In addition, I was unable to find a report of a parasitic infestation producing such striking bony lesions. The presence of cats brings the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis to mind, but it is not compatible with the clinical picture. The eosinophilia raises the question of a systemic vasculitis. However, no other features of the illness are consistent with that diagnosis, and the absence of renal disease and skin disease is striking.We are left, then, with consideration of a chronic granulomatous disease involving the bones, the right lung, the central nervous system, and possibly the bone marrow. Metastatic tumor, infection, and parasitic infestation are less likely diagnoses. The granulomatous disease could have been a chronic bacterial infection, a fungal or mycobacterial infection, or a proliferation of a specific cell type.I shall now review some specific aspects of the case record. When the patient was first seen, about seven months after the onset of the illness, she had neck pain, which had become increasingly severe. Physical examination was negative. She had a relative granulocytopenia, with 13 percent neutrophils. She had 22 percent eosinophils, equivalent to a total eosinophil count of 1250, with the normal being up to 500 per cubic millimeter. The sedimentation rate was elevated. X-ray films and later a CT scan of the cervical spine showed a combined osteolytic and osteoblastic lesion involving a large portion of the sixth cervical vertebra. Skin tests were negative, indicating anergy and raising the question of sarcoidosis or conceivably of widespread tuberculosis. After some delay a bone scan demonstrated widely dispersed disease involving the sphenoid bone, the sixth cervical vertebra, the second lumbar vertebra, the sacral vertebras, the actabulum, the ilium, and one rib. I assume that at this point the physicians taking care of the patient were concerned principally with the possibility of chronic infection or metastatic tumor. However, the patient declined further investigation.When next seen almost six weeks later she had begun to have increasing headaches. Examination showed mild papilledema; the findings on neurologic examination were otherwise normal. She again had a mild anemia and eosinophilia, with an eosinophil count of 728 per cubic millimeter. At this time a CT scan of the brain was finally accomplished and disclosed a large lesion of the left temporal lobe and a smaller area of possible abnormality in the right pons. Neither of these lesions was clinically apparent except in terms of increased intracranial pressure. The lesion in the temporal lobe had an irregular ring of enhancement and a low-absorptive center after the intravenous administration of contrast material.The discovery of the lesion in the left temporal lobe begins to explain her personality and behavior. Patients with temporal-lobe lesions may have temporal-lobe epilepsy or an interictal personality disturbance, or both. The attributes of the personality disturbance include religiosity, paranoia, a tendency to obsessionality, an altered sexual pattern, and aggressiveness.[1](#core-r001) This patient had a history of one episode strongly suggestive of a temporal-lobe seizure, in which she described herself as feeling drugged, with ideas and experiences racing through her mind. Frequent seizures are not a prerequisite for the diagnosis of temporal-lobe epilepsy, for which this patient was clearly at risk. In her contacts with doctors the patient could be described as \"difficult,\" but a less judgmental term would be \"eccentric.\" Patients of this type and the medical profession frequently clash about the need for diagnostic testing and the nature of an illness or its management. I believe that such a clash happened in this case, and the explanation for her behavior may have been found in the CT scan.At this time we should review the radiologic studies.Dr. Kenneth R. Davis: Films of the cervical spine from the previous admission ([Fig. 1](#f001)) show a sclerotic abnormality of the sixth cervical vertebral body and right pedicle. The films from the computed tomographic examination of the spine ([Fig. 2](#f002)) indicate osteoblastic and osteolytic abnormalities of the body, right pedicle, and proximal lamina of the left pedicle of the sixth cervical vertebra, without a soft-tissue mass.A radionuclide bone scan performed three months before admission ([Fig. 3](#f003)) reveals multiple areas of increased activity including the sixth and seventh cervical vertebral bodies, the left side of the second lumbar and the first two sacral vertebral bodies, the sphenoid bone, the left side of the acetabular portion of the ilium, and the anterior portion of the fifth left rib. X-ray films of the lumbar spine obtained at that time show increased density of the pedicle of the left second lumbar vertebra. A skull film discloses sclerosis of the sphenoid bone in the region of the sella. The plain CT scan of the brain shows an abnormal mass in the left temporal lobe with a slightly high absorptive irregular ring and low-absorptive center, surrounded by edema. There was abnormal enhancement of the ring after the intravenous injection of contrast material. These findings are consistent with a neoplasm. There was abnormal enhancement in the right anterior upper pons, without a mass effect.An x-ray film of the chest obtained on the second hospital day ([Fig. 5](#f005)) shows a mass in the right upper lobe with extension into the anterior mediastinum and a right pleural effusion. There is a suggestion, but no conclusive evidence, of involvement of regional lymph nodes. Changes of old granulomatous disease are visible in both lung fields. A CT scan of the chest also demonstrates the right-upper-lobe mass with extension into the anterior mediastinum. It is impossible, however, to exclude a mediastinal origin of the mass. Pleural fluid is evident posteriorly on the right side. An MRI scan ([Fig. 4](#f004)) reveals abnormal T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity in the right side of the pons. A mass with central T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity is seen in the left temporal lobe. An irregular surrounding ring is hypointense on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. There is evidence of peripheral edema, which is hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images.Dr. Dawson: Those are very interesting radiologic findings. The lesion in the pons is much more convincing when seen than it is as described in the case record. Also, the mass effect of the temporal-lobe lesion indicates that the possibility of tumor must still be considered.In summary, we have the problem of a multifocal process involving many bones, the lung, and the temporal lobe. I assume that all these lesions were the result of the same pathologic process.I believe that this patient had a chronic granulomatous process involving the structures that have just been reviewed. The best explanation is a condition known as multifocal eosinophilic granuloma, which is of unknown cause and involves a proliferation of histiocytes. Histiocytic disorders were previously called histiocytosis X.[2](#core-r002) However, that term has now fallen into disfavor, and the alleged unity of syndromes, such as eosinophilic granuloma of bone, Hand\u2013Sch\u00fcller\u2013Christian disease, and Letterer\u2013Siwe disease, is now disputed. Letterer\u2013Siwe disease is currently believed to be an atypical malignant lymphoma occurring in infancy or childhood.[3](#core-r003) The understanding of eosinophilic granuloma as a disease has been assisted considerably in recent years by the discovery of involvement of a specific cell type, the Langerhans' cell, which is derived from the bone marrow and is found normally in the skin and rarely in the lymphatic system. This type of cell contains distinct cytoplasmic granules and specific surface markers \u2014 for example, the T6 surface marker,[3](#core-r003) which is also expressed in some thymocytes. Langerhans' cells can usually be recognized in biopsy material. The unifocal or restricted form of eosinophilic granuloma presents as a single bone lesion, which can be removed surgically and responds to radiation therapy. The relation of the unifocal disease to the multifocal disease is unknown. Only a small minority of patients with unifocal eosinophilic granuloma eventually have a generalized illness.The clinical manifestations of multifocal eosinophilic granuloma are numerous, and I shall restrict my comments principally to the neurologic aspects of the illness. The pulmonary features were comprehensively discussed at one of these conferences published within the past year,[4](#core-r004) and a description of the bony lesions is available in many sources in the literature.Eosinophilic granuloma may present in numerous areas of the nervous system.[5](#core-r005) In its most restricted form it may appear in the hypothalamus and produce diabetes insipidus.[6](#core-r006) A lesion of this type may be almost impossible to distinguish clinically from an astrocytoma of the hypothalamus or an adjacent region. In some cases the pituitary gland is also infiltrated with histiocytes. A number of patients have had disease restricted to the hypothalamus, with no detectable granuloma elsewhere.[5](#core-r005)It is of interest that histiocytosis in the region of the hypothalamus was the first type to be described in the medical literature and is a feature of the syndrome described by Hand, although he originally believed that it was due to tuberculosis, and later by Christian, who noted the lesions of the calvarium in association with exophthalmos and diabetes insipidus. That syndrome is now known to occur in only a minority of the patients with multifocal eosinophilic granuloma, probably in less than a third of them. The histiocytes may also be found in the meninges and may be the source of a chronic meningitis[7](#core-r007) that is comparable to other granulomatous diseases, including tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, chronic fungal infections, chronic granulomatous angiitis, and even Whipple's disease. On one occasion the abnormal histiocytes were detected in the spinal fluid.[8](#core-r008)The tumor masses may be present in almost any area of the brain. The cerebellum is an area of particular predilection, and bilateral calcified tumors in the region of the dentate nucleus are very characteristic.[9](#core-r009) Temporal-lobe masses have been described,[10,11](#core-r010) as have lesions in the dura and lesions of the calvarium with subjacent masses in the brain.[11,12](#core-r011) Although histiocytic lesions in other parts of the body, particularly in bone, tend to be destructive with osteolytic changes and pathologic fractures, the tumor masses in the brain usually do not cavitate and have little tendency to result in necrosis or tissue destruction. The bony lesions may cause compression of the spinal cord as a result of fracture, collapse, or growth within the spinal canal. Involvement has been recorded in the cervical and lumbar regions, and tumors of the cauda equina and rare tumors of the substance of the spinal cord itself have been reported.[13\u201316](#core-r013) One unusual and possibly adventitious form of the illness has been described in a few patients \u2014 namely, a central, spreading type of demyelination producing multiple plaques in the white matter. According to Kepes,[5](#core-r005) these plaques are not due to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and do not resemble those of multiple sclerosis.The tumors affecting the nervous system have been treated in several ways. As is true elsewhere in the body, the granuloma is radiosensitive, and radiation therapy has been undertaken. In a few cases cytotoxic chemotherapy has been effective. Most of the experience in this field has been anecdotal since the disease is rare, and a large series in which various types of therapy could be compared has never been compiled.A final important note is the relation of peripheral eosinophilia to this illness. The great majority of patients with eosinophilic granuloma have no detectable eosinophilia in the peripheral blood. Eosinophilia of the level observed in the case under discussion is not expected. However, I have found two isolated case reports of patients who had 20 percent eosinophilia in association with a temporal-lobe mass.[11,13](#core-r011)Having described this rare disorder, I shall return to the case record to see how closely it conforms to the picture of multifocal eosinophilic granuloma reported in the literature. The lesion in the temporal lobe seems compatible with that described in a few previous reports of such tumors. The pulmonary tumor is likewise compatible with this diagnosis. Eosinophilia is not common, although it has been described. It should be pointed out that massive eosinophilia, in the range of 50,000 to 100,000 total eosinophils per cubic millimeter, is seen only with malignant or pseudomalignant syndromes, such as the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. The total eosinophil count in this patient was only one or two times normal. The bony lesions in this patient are not typical of eosinophilic granuloma. Most eosinophilic granulomas, whether single or multiple, are purely lytic, but Cavanagh and Russell[17](#core-r017) described osteoblastic lesions as part of the spectrum of the disease. It may be that the adult forms of the disease and especially adult forms in which the disease is of fairly long duration are those in which osteoblastic changes occur. The location of the tumor in the sphenoid bone is highly characteristic of eosinophilic granuloma, as are the lesions described by Dr. Davis in the vertebras.I suspect that these lesions were approached by biopsy. The temporal-lobe lesion was surgically accessible, although in the presence of an elevated intracranial pressure exploration of it could not have been an easy operation. Likewise, the pulmonary tumor could have been reached by an open biopsy.[18](#core-r018) A skin biopsy, if skin lesions had been present, would have been very useful.[19](#core-r019) In this case, however, a needle biopsy of a lumbar vertebra was probably the procedure of choice and needed to be done to exclude an infectious cause.Having described a rare disease in some detail, I shall now mention more common disorders, of which the chief one in this setting is metastatic carcinoma or lymphoma. I have been led away from that diagnosis by the general good health of the patient and the long duration of the illness. As clinicians we are not accustomed to seeing patients who have symptoms caused by metastasis for more than eight or nine months without treatment before the time of the diagnosis. If this process proved to be metastatic tumor, what was its source? The appearance of the temporal-lobe mass is much more characteristic of carcinoma than of lymphoma, and the widespread bony disease also suggests carcinoma, by definition a carcinoma of unknown origin, since I assume that the pulmonary nodule would also have been metastatic. A cancer of unknown primary source is not rare; for example, in a series from Memorial Sloan\u2013Kettering Cancer Center 8 of 94 tumors that were metastatic to the brain and were deemed suitable for surgical extirpation were of unknown source.[20](#core-r020) Many such neoplasms are adenocarcinomas.Dr. Charles J. Curatalo: When the patient was referred from the Medical Clinic to the Neurology Clinic the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia was being considered on the basis of the x-ray films and CT scan and bone scan of the spine. Dr. Davis, what are your thoughts in that regard?Dr. Davis: The findings on the radiologic studies do not suggest fibrous dysplasia, in my opinion.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: Dr. Kamitsuka, may we have the opinions of the medical students?Dr. Paul F. Kamitsuka: After considering several infectious diseases the medical students thought that the clinical picture fits best with that of a widely metastatic neoplasm. Despite the patient's youth and lack of risk factors they considered a bronchogenic carcinoma to be the most likely primary tumor, although lymphoma was also considered. They favored a percutaneous needle biopsy of the lung mass as the diagnostic procedure of choice.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Richardson: The diagnostic procedure was a needle-aspiration biopsy of the lung lesion. Microscopical examination of the specimen showed groups of large cells of epithelial type suggestive of a carcinoma ([Fig. 6](#f006)).Serious consideration was then given to management of the patient's care, taking into account her unwillingness to submit to further diagnostic studies or therapeutic measures. Although the aspiration biopsy had produced strong evidence of a carcinoma, the physicians caring for the patient concluded that a better characterization of the tumor should be attempted. They considered biopsy of the intracerebral mass but decided against it because of her intact neurologic state and the possible complications of an intracranial surgical procedure. After prolonged discussions the patient consented to an open biopsy of the mass in the lung. Examination of the specimen showed an epithelial neoplasm with a variable pattern in which areas of diffuse sheet-like growth were interrupted by acini or papillae ([Fig. 7](#f007)). Mitotic figures were frequent. Occasional tumor cells contained mucin. Immunoperoxidase studies demonstrated that a few tumor cells stained for neuronspecific enolase, possibly indicating neuroendocrine differentiation. Staining of the cells was negative for thyroglobulin, chromogranin, and calcitonin \u2014 evidence against a thyroid carcinoma, carcinoid, and other tumors.Electron-microscopical examination disclosed large cytoplasmic granules of a secretory product, which also was present in the lumens of glands. These findings confirmed the identification of the tumor as an adenocarcinoma but did not establish the primary site. No biopsy has been undertaken of the cerebral or osseous lesions. Even so, it seems certain that they are metastases.Dr. Curatalo, will you tell us what was done for the patient?Dr. Curatalo: She received radiation treatment to the brain as an outpatient but discontinued it two weeks after its initiation. When I saw her in the Neurology Clinic three months after the biopsy the neurologic examination was still negative. She was recently admitted to another hospital, where she sought a second opinion on the possibility of surgical resection of the left-temporal-lobe tumor.Dr. Richardson: Dr. Scully, what are your thoughts regarding the tumor?Dr. Robert E. Scully: This type of tumor is unusual in a patient of this age. The pathologist, when confronted with a solitary mass in the lung that proves to be an adenocarcinoma, has to consider the possibility of a metastatic rather than a primary tumor. In one series of cases almost one of four adenocarcinomas of the lung proved on careful clinical investigation to be metastatic from another site.[21](#core-r021) The most common sources of metastatic carcinomas are the sites where carcinomas are most prevalent. Breast carcinomas are frequently sources of lung metastases, but they are almost always evident on physical examination by the time pulmonary spread has occurred. The diagnosis of breast cancer appears very unlikely in this case. The most frequent primary tumors that present as solitary pulmonary masses are colorectal carcinomas and renal-cell carcinomas, but carcinomas from various other sites can rarely present in this way.In the case under discussion we can exclude some of the most common sources with almost complete certainty. The tumor does not resemble a renal-cell carcinoma. The presence of abundant mucin in the glandular spaces for practical purposes rules out that diagnosis. The tumor also does not resemble a colorectal carcinoma, which almost always has a distinctive appearance on microscopical examination. Since the tumor stained negatively for thyroglobulin and calcitonin, a rare metastasis from a thyroid carcinoma is very unlikely; the presence of mucin is also very strong evidence against that diagnosis. One possibility that is suggested by the morphologic pattern of the tumor is a metastatic ovarian carcinoma, but for an ovarian carcinoma to present as metastatic tumor to the lung, bones, and brain would be extremely unusual.We are left with a strong probability that this patient has a primary adenocarcinoma of the lung, although it has atypical features. Adenocarcinoma of the lung is peripheral instead of central in about 70 percent of the cases and is very rare in this age group. In a study of more than 4000 cases of carcinoma of the lung from the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency[22](#core-r022) the investigators found that only about 2 percent of these tumors occurred in patients under the age of 40 years. The youngest patient in their series was 18 years of age. The carcinomas in patients under 40 years of age were adenocarcinomas in 40 percent of the cases, in contrast to a frequency of only about 20 percent in all age groups. The adenocarcinomas in the younger patients appeared to have a more virulent course than those older patients. In another study, from Milan,[23](#core-r023) only 2 of 1514 examples of lung cancer were found in patients under the age of 30 years. The authors of this investigation found no difference in cell type or clinical behavior between tumors occurring in younger patients and those developing in older patients.Dr. Richardson: While the patient was in this hospital she had a mammographic study, which was negative, and she also had a gynecologic evaluation, which showed no evidence of a pelvic mass.Dr. Milton J. Plata: I wonder about an occult primary carcinoma of the pancreas, specifically of the body or tail.Dr. Scully: The histologic appearance is not characteristic but is compatible with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which may be occult and very difficult to detect. A gastric carcinoma is another possibility. Dr. Edward A. Edwards: The absence of pain over the period of a year is against the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.Dr. Robert Fienberg: I wonder whether the eosinophilia was related to her allergic condition. Her allergic asthma raises the question of the Churg\u2013Strauss phenomenon. This is generally associated with asthma and vasculitis such as periarteritis nodosa or pathergic (Wegener's) granulomatosis, but we have seen other associations, such as with cholesterol embolism,[24](#core-r024) in an asthmatic patient with a high eosinophil count. The question is whether conditions other than vasculitis or granulomatosis in an asthmatic patient may produce eosinophilia. It is interesting that there were no eosinophils in the vicinity of the tumor, suggesting that the eosinophilia was probably of systemic origin, possibly a host reaction.Dr. Walter J. Koroshetz: Is there a history of adenocarcinoma in the patient's family, and is adenocarcinoma of the lung occurring in young persons associated with a strong family history?Dr. Richardson: As far as we know, there is no family history of neoplasms or genetic abnormalities.Dr. Scully: It is stated in the literature that about half the patients under 40 years of age with lung carcinoma have a very strong family history of cancer of the lung or other organs.[2](#core-r002)Dr. Daniel R. Kuritzkes: I saw the patient for the Infectious Disease Unit before the biopsy. We considered that the eosinophilia might be explained by a parasitic infestation incidental to her primary diagnosis or that it might be a clue to lymphoma. As it turned out, examination of her stools was negative for ova and parasites, and of course examination of the biopsy specimen revealed adenocarcinoma and not lymphoma.Dr. Pauline M. Cooke: I would not necessarily attribute the patient's mental state to the temporal-lobe lesion. She apparently belongs to a subset of culture in the population that shares her attitudes about the virtue of a macrobiotic diet and shares her doubts about the efficacy of medical therapy.Dr. Richardson: I agree. It seems very likely, however, as Dr. Dawson pointed out, that the peculiar episode that occurred while she was sitting in the sun on the beach was a form of seizure resulting from the temporal-lobe lesion.Dr. Cooke: She was having migraine, too. That attack could also have been an atypical episode of migraine.Dr. Richardson: She did have a history of typical migraine, with a visual aura of bright lights in one or the other visual field in somewhat geometric patterns. We presented Dr. Dawson with a case of an extremely rare entity this morning. I think perhaps that it is even rarer than the disease that he suggested.\n",

      "question": "A 64-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of a productive cough during treatment for suspected Wegener's granulomatosis.\nThe patient had been well until seven months earlier, when he began to have unsteadiness and right-sided tinnitus, with constant maxillary, nasal, frontal, and temporal pain, which was more prominent on the right side. Treatment with prednisone (40 mg daily) was begun, with considerable improvement of the headache. A biopsy of the left temporal artery showed no evidence of arteritis. Two months before admission, a test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) was positive, with a perinuclear pattern of staining (P-ANCA), and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was positive for antibodies to myeloperoxidase at a titer of 18 U (normal value, less than 2.8). Three weeks later, another ANCA test was positive, with a P-ANCA pattern and an antimyeloperoxidase-antibody titer of 6.8 U.\nThree weeks before the current admission, the patient was first admitted to this hospital because of right facial weakness with dysarthria.\nThe results of an examination were normal except for an almost complete right peripheral facial palsy and sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear.\nThe urine was normal. The levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, bilirubin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal. The results of other laboratory tests are shown in\nTable 1\nand\nTable 2\n. Radiographs of the chest showed scarring or subsegmental atelectasis at the base of the left lung. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head, obtained without the administration of contrast material because of a reported allergy, revealed mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus and a soft-tissue mass in the right petrous apex. A CT scan of the temporal bones (\nFigure 1\n) revealed a soft-tissue mass with bony destruction involving the right petrous apex and the petrous carotid canal and extending along the right aspect of the clivus and the floor of the middle cranial fossa. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the brain (\nFigure 2\n), performed before and after the injection of gadolinium, showed an abnormal signal in the right mastoid air cells and petrous apex. A CT scan of the chest showed loss of volume in the lower lobes of both lungs, with subsegmental atelectasis and possible scarring at both bases.\nA specimen of urine contained no Bence Jones protein. The level of angiotensin-converting enzyme was normal, and a test of a urine specimen for\nHistoplasma capsulatum\nantigen was negative. A lumbar puncture was performed (\nTable 3\n). Tests for cryptococcal antigen and antibodies to\nBorrelia burgdorferi\nand a polymerase-chain-reaction test for herpes simplex virus were negative. The serum C3 and C4 levels were normal. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies, anticentromere antibodies, anti-Ro antibodies, anti-La antibodies, anti-SM antibodies, and anti\u2013U1-RNP antibodies and a serologic test for syphilis were negative. A right suboccipital burr-hole procedure was performed. Biopsy specimens of the meninges and cerebellum were nondiagnostic on microscopical examination and on culture. The patient was discharged on the 16th hospital day with instructions to take methotrexate (15 mg subcutaneously once a week), folic acid (1 mg daily), prednisone (30 mg daily), and omeprazole (20 mg daily).\nOne day after discharge, a cough productive of yellow sputum developed, with nausea, vomiting, chilliness, and sweats. Six days after discharge, the patient was readmitted.\nThe temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, the pulse was 88, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 135/90 mm Hg.\nExamination showed peripheral right-sided facial palsy and right hearing loss. The gag reflex was less active on the right side than on the left.\nThe urine was positive (+) for protein. The sediment was normal. The levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, bilirubin, calcium, phosphorus, electrolytes, magnesium, creatine kinase, amylase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. The results of other laboratory tests are shown in\nTable 1\nand\nTable 2\n. Radiographs of the chest were unchanged. A culture of the sputum yielded normal respiratory tract flora. Another test for P-ANCA was positive, with an antimyeloperoxidase-antibody titer of 5.9 U.\nSpecimens of blood, urine, and sputum were obtained for culture. Hydrocortisone (100 mg three times daily) was substituted for prednisone for two days, and ticarcillin therapy was begun. The nausea and vomiting improved progressively. The temperature did not exceed 37.7\u00b0C during the next two days.\nOn the second hospital day, a radionuclide bone scan revealed a slight uptake in the right mastoid region. Repeated chest radiographs were unchanged. On the next day, a lumbar puncture was performed (\nTable 3\n). Prednisone (60 mg daily) was resumed. That evening, the temperature rose to 37.7\u00b0C, and additional specimens of blood were obtained for culture.\nOtolaryngologic examination revealed edematous turbinate mucosa and slight granularity of the anterior nasal septum. The right true vocal cord was immobile in a paramedian position, and the left cord moved normally, but glottic closure was incomplete.\nOn the fifth hospital day, the temperature rose to 38.6\u00b0C. A CT scan of the paranasal sinuses (\nFigure 3\n) showed opacification of the ethmoid air cells, mucosal thickening of the sinuses, and a defect in the anterior inferior aspect of the left lamina papyracea, without herniation of orbital fat. All culture specimens were negative.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Robert W. Simms[\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiographs?Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: A CT scan of the temporal bones ([Figure 1](#f01)) obtained during the previous admission shows a soft-tissue mass in the right petrous apex causing bony destruction. The mass abuts the carotid canal, with possible erosion. An axial T1-weighted image from the MRI scan of the head reveals an abnormal soft-tissue signal in the region of the right petrous apex. A T2-weighted image shows an increased signal in the same region, as well as an abnormal signal in the sphenoid sinus and maxillary sinus and in the ethmoid sinuses more superiorly. A coronal T1-weighted image obtained after the administration of gadolinium ([Figure 2](#f02)) shows abnormal enhancement of the petrous apex on the right side as compared with the left side. In addition, there is mass effect, with upward displacement of the inferior temporal lobe and involvement of Meckel's cave on the right side.A CT scan of the orbits ([Figure 3](#f03)) obtained during the current admission reveals mucosal thickening of the left maxillary antrum, with a bony defect of the medial wall of the left maxillary antrum and a defect in the left lamina papyracea. A bone scan shows increased uptake of radioisotope in the region of the right mastoid air cells.Dr. Simms: The differential diagnosis in this case spans a broad group of disorders, including chronic infections of the middle ear and sinuses, idiopathic inflammatory diseases, primary and metastatic neoplasms, and various forms of vasculitis.Common bacterial infections are unlikely causes of this patient's illness because of its chronic course and the negative results of blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. Both *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and atypical mycobacteria, however, may cause indolent destructive lesions of the middle ear, particularly in children in developing countries.[1,2](#core-r001) Patients typically present with chronic otic infections, frequently accompanied by mastoiditis, and extension into the meninges may lead to cranial-nerve palsy.[3](#core-r003) Associated lymphadenitis is common. Destructive osteitis arising in the middle-ear ossicles may extend to the petrous apex or into the mastoid bone. Fewer than 2 percent of cases of tuberculosis present as mastoiditis, and most of these cases are associated with extensive pulmonary disease.[4](#core-r004) Middle-ear tuberculosis is diagnosed by identification of mycobacteria in cultures of drainage material or by biopsy.[1](#core-r001) The high lymphocyte and protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in this case are consistent with the diagnosis of meningeal tuberculosis, but two cultures of cerebrospinal fluid were negative for mycobacteria. Also, a meningeal-biopsy specimen showed no evidence of *M. tuberculosis,* either on histologic examination or on culture. Therefore, I shall discount tuberculosis as a likely diagnosis.The presence of fever, chronic sinusitis, and neurologic manifestations points to the possibility of a fungal infection. Two forms of fungal sinusitis have been described: invasive and noninvasive.[5](#core-r005) Among the invasive forms, granulomatous fungal sinusitis, typically due to *Aspergillus flavus,* often causes exophthalmos.[5](#core-r005) Although this type of infection may occur in immunocompetent patients, most forms of invasive fungal sinusitis affect immunocompromised patients. In this case, the anatomical separation of the sinusitis and the petrous mass suggests that they are not caused by the same process, as would be expected with invasive fungal infection. Furthermore, the absence of exophthalmos and the relative stability of the sinusitis over time in the absence of antifungal therapy argue against the diagnosis of a fungal infection.Syphilis infrequently involves the middle ear and causes destruction of the eighth cranial nerve. Other cranial nerves, including nerves III, VI, and VII, may be involved on one or both sides in cases of meningovascular or cerebral syphilis.[6](#core-r006) The cerebrospinal fluid is typically abnormal, particularly in cases of cerebral syphilis, but marked destruction of bone does not occur.[1,6](#core-r001) In view of the negative serologic test for syphilis and the absence of other clues suggesting the diagnosis in this case, I shall not consider it further.Actinomycosis produces abscesses and sinus tracts, forming tumor-like masses.[7](#core-r007) In the cervicofacial form of infection, which is the most common, the organism enters through the oral mucosa. The infection typically occurs in patients with periodontal disease or dental caries. In rare cases, the infection extends from the pharynx or retromaxillary space into the petrous bone[1,7](#core-r001) and may extend from the base of the skull to the meninges and brain. The diagnosis is based on identification of the agent in secretions and biopsy specimens.[1,7](#core-r001) In this case, however, the separation of the sinus disease and the petrous bone lesions, the absence of oral disease, and the negative cultures make actinomycosis unlikely.Among the idiopathic inflammatory diseases, sarcoidosis should be considered. Sarcoidosis of the central nervous system affects primarily the meninges and, in decreasing order of frequency, cranial nerves VII, VIII, II, III, IV, VI, and I.[8](#core-r008) Sarcoidosis is unlikely in this case because of the normal level of angiotensin-converting enzyme, the nondiagnostic findings on meningeal biopsy, and the absence of thoracic lymphadenopathy, characteristic pulmonary lesions, and uveitis.Eosinophilic granuloma, also known as Langerhans' cell granulomatosis, may be unifocal or multifocal.[9](#core-r009) It was formerly included in the spectrum of diseases known as histiocytosis X, along with Hand\u2013Sch\u00fcller\u2013Christian disease (a disorder characterized by calvarial defects, exophthalmos, and diabetes insipidus) and Letterer\u2013Siwe disease (an acute generalized disease of infancy). Eosinophilic granuloma originates within bone but can also affect the lungs, skin, lymph nodes, and oral mucosa. Involvement of the temporal bone is common but is usually associated with multiple bone lesions.[10](#core-r010) There is at least one reported case of unifocal involvement of the petrous portion of the temporal bone with facial-nerve palsy.[11](#core-r011) Involvement of the paranasal bone may cause sinusitis.[1](#core-r001) Neurologic involvement is uncommon, but involvement of cranial nerves V, VII, VIII, and IX has been reported.[1](#core-r001) Multifocal eosinophilic granuloma is difficult to rule out in this case, but the absence of skin lesions and other bone lesions, the involvement of multiple cranial nerves and the presence of meningitis make the diagnosis unlikely.Various primary neoplasms arising from the temporal bone and surrounding structures can produce a number of the features described in this case. The most likely neoplasm is adenocarcinoma, which arises from the mucosal lining of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. With an indolent course that can mimic that of chronic infectious ear disease,[12](#core-r012) adenocarcinoma may be associated with the erosion of surrounding bone, the presence of a soft-tissue mass, and multiple cranial neuropathies.[12](#core-r012) Metastasis to the temporal bone may also occur. A primary or metastatic tumor is unlikely, however, in the presence of associated meningitis (without cytologic evidence of a malignant tumor) and prominent sinusitis. The differential diagnosis of erosive lesions of the skull also includes malignant midline reticulosis (lethal midline granuloma), which is a T-cell or natural-killer-cell lymphoma, but it initially involves the midpalate and nasal septum and has not been reported to involve the temporal bone.A plasmacytoma involving the base of the skull and cranial nerves could explain a number of the features of this case. These tumors occur as single or multiple lesions; monoclonal immunoglobulin may be detected in the blood. Extramedullary plasmacytomas often involve the head and neck, most frequently the paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, and tonsillar fossa.[12](#core-r012) A solitary plasmacytoma of the temporal bone can cause bone destruction, impairment of sound transmission, loss of function in cochlear, vestibular, and facial nerves, and other cranial neuropathies.[1](#core-r001) Multiple myeloma may occur as a solitary plasmacytoma in this region, with the same clinical manifestations.[13](#core-r013) In this patient, the absence of a monoclonal gammopathy and the prominent sinusitis with aseptic meningitis argue against the diagnosis of plasmacytoma.In rare cases, malignant lymphoma with angiocentric lesions involves the sinuses or cranial nerves,[14,15](#core-r014) but it is generally associated with pulmonary involvement, usually in the form of nodules, and skin lesions are often present.Some form of vasculitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case, with its multiple clinical features and the positive results of several ANCA tests. The usefulness of ANCA testing has increased over the past decade, particularly in the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis and other types of primary vasculitis, but the interpretation of the test results varies with the clinical setting.[16\u201321](#core-r016) The optimal evaluation of serum ANCA levels may require both an indirect immunofluorescence assay of the patient's serum on ethanol-fixed neutrophils and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the presence of antibodies to the two principal ANCA targets: myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3, a 29-kd glycoprotein from azurophilic myeloid granules with serine protease activity.[22](#core-r022) The cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) staining pattern results largely from antibodies to proteinase 3; the P-ANCA staining pattern is produced by antibodies to myeloperoxidase and several other antigens, including lactoferrin, cathepsin G, and elastase.[21](#core-r021) The P-ANCA pattern is an artifact of ethanol fixation, since the highly cationic myeloperoxidase appears to attach to the negatively charged nuclear membrane during fixation.[23](#core-r023)ANCA tests were first used for the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, as proposed by van der Woude et al.[24](#core-r024) It appeared at first that the C-ANCA pattern was associated almost exclusively with Wegener's granulomatosis, whereas the P-ANCA pattern was found in patients with microscopic polyarteritis.[25](#core-r025) It later became clear that the positive predictive value of ANCA testing depended on the prevalence of disease in the population of patients undergoing testing, since ANCA was detected in patients with a wide variety of disorders, including infections, inflammatory bowel disease, connective-tissue disorders, autoimmune hepatitis, and malignant tumors.[21,26](#core-r021) The positive predictive value of ANCA testing for the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis increases with the presence of the C-ANCA pattern, the presence of a high titer of proteinase 3, and the absence of antinuclear antibodies.[19](#core-r019) The P-ANCA pattern, by itself, is relatively nonspecific, but the presence of antibodies to myeloperoxidase, which virtually always produce the P-ANCA pattern, is relatively specific for the diagnosis of forms of vasculitis now known to be associated with the presence of ANCA ([Table 4](#t04)).[26,27](#core-r026) In this group of disorders, which includes Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyarteritis, idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis, the Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, and overlapping forms of these diseases, the specificity of the presence of antibodies to myeloperoxidase may be as high as 94 to 99 percent. However, antibodies to myeloperoxidase have also been reported in patients with hydralazine-induced glomerulonephritis, patients with anti\u2013glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, and some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.[22,26,27](#core-r022) Serum ANCA testing remains far less diagnostic than biopsy. According to Edgar, an ANCA test is \u201cnot suitable as a screening test for vasculitis, and there is an appreciable risk associated with overreliance on an ANCA result (positive or negative).\u201d[21](#core-r021)The P-ANCA pattern with antibodies to myeloperoxidase is most closely associated with microscopic polyarteritis,[27](#core-r027) which is characterized by necrosis of small arteries, capillaries, or veins, without granulomas. Unlike polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyarteritis is almost always associated with necrotizing glomerulonephritis and is often associated with pulmonary capillaritis and hemorrhage.[28](#core-r028) Patients with microscopic polyarteritis present with predominantly renal or pulmonary features or with a full-blown pulmonary\u2013renal syndrome resembling Goodpasture's syndrome.[27](#core-r027) Other organ systems may be involved.[29](#core-r029) However, the disorder can be difficult to distinguish clinically from polyarteritis nodosa, and it was not considered a separate entity until recently.[28](#core-r028) Peripheral neuropathy occurs less frequently in patients with microscopic polyarteritis than in those with polyarteritis nodosa, and microaneurysms are not seen in association with microscopic polyarteritis. In addition, the P-ANCA pattern with antibodies to myeloperoxidase is found in 50 to 80 percent of patients with microscopic polyarteritis but in fewer than 20 percent of those with polyarteritis nodosa.[28](#core-r028) Cranial neuropathy occurs in only 2 percent of patients with either disorder.[30](#core-r030) The combination of involvement of the temporal bone, sensorineural hearing loss, and palsy of the seventh cranial nerve has been reported infrequently in patients with polyarteritis nodosa.[31](#core-r031) Pathological features of such cases include inflammatory infiltrates and granulation tissue within the middle ear and mastoid cavity, with vasculitis around the temporal bone.[31](#core-r031) Sinusitis is very rare in patients with polyarteritis nodosa but occurs in up to 9 percent of those with microscopic polyarteritis.[28](#core-r028) In this patient, there was no convincing evidence of either glomerulonephritis or pulmonary disease characteristic of microscopic polyarteritis. The cough productive of yellow sputum may have been caused by bronchitis or perhaps aspiration of oropharyngeal contents, since vocal-cord dysfunction was noted several days later. Therefore, neither polyarteritis nodosa nor microscopic polyarteritis is a strong diagnostic possibility in this case.Antibodies to myeloperoxidase are found in up to 60 percent of patients with the Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome,[32](#core-r032) but the absence of asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, and pulmonary infiltrates in this patient and the involvement of multiple cranial nerves make the diagnosis unlikely.Some cases do not fit neatly into the diagnostic category of Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, or the Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome. A disorder with features that overlap these categories is called the polyangiitis overlap syndrome.[33](#core-r033) Most patients with this syndrome have positive ANCA tests. Patients with antibodies to proteinase 3 have features suggestive of Wegener's granulomatosis, whereas those with antibodies to myeloperoxidase often have features of the Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome.[23](#core-r023) However, even these categories are indistinct.[23](#core-r023)Limited Wegener's granulomatosis has the pathological characteristics of the typical form of the disease but without involvement of the upper and lower respiratory tract and kidneys, and the ANCA test is less likely to be positive than in patients with the typical form of the disease.[23,34,35](#core-r023) Ten to 18 percent of patients with either limited or typical Wegener's granulomatosis have the P-ANCA pattern with antibodies to myeloperoxidase, whereas 50 to 80 percent have the C-ANCA pattern with antibodies to proteinase 3.[19,36](#core-r019)Limited Wegener's granulomatosis accounts for virtually all the features of this case. At presentation, 50 to 60 percent of patients with this disorder have sinusitis,[15,37](#core-r015) and 6 percent have hearing loss due to the formation of granulation tissue around the eustachian tube and tympanum.[15](#core-r015) Destruction of the petrous part of the temporal bone and inflammatory masses at the base of the skull have been reported.[12,31,38](#core-r012) Erosion of the lamina papyracea or orbital wall due to extension of disease from the paranasal sinuses is common.[39](#core-r039) Although neurologic disease is rarely present initially, it develops in more than half the cases.[15,40,41](#core-r015) A single cranial nerve is involved in 6 percent of patients, and multiple cranial nerves are affected in 2.5 percent.[41](#core-r041) In the series described by Fauci et al.[15](#core-r015) in 1983, involvement of cranial nerves VIII, IX, and XII was noted, and involvement of cranial nerves II through X and XII has been reported recently.[42](#core-r042) Multiple cranial neuropathies may be caused by small-vessel vasculitis or by a granulomatous inflammatory process in the meninges.[42,43](#core-r042) The literature contains 17 case reports of biopsy-confirmed or probable meningitis due to Wegener's granulomatosis.[42](#core-r042) Lymphocytes are found in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the protein level is elevated.[41,42](#core-r041) Meningeal enhancement has been reported on MRI scans obtained after the administration of gadolinium, a finding not noted in this case.[44](#core-r044) Since the diagnostic yield of meningeal biopsy in cases of chronic meningitis is reportedly low, it is not surprising that a meningeal biopsy did not show granulomatous vasculitis in this case.[45](#core-r045)The options for a diagnostic procedure include biopsy of the mass eroding the petrous bone and biopsy of the sinuses. Although sinus biopsy yields a small sample, making it difficult to identify all the pathological features of Wegener's granulomatosis,[40](#core-r040) it is a less invasive procedure with a lower risk of complications than biopsy of the petrous mass and is therefore the first choice. If sinus biopsy is nondiagnostic, it can be followed by biopsy of the petrous mass.Dr. Peter A. Merkel: We favored the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis but were concerned about overlooking a different diagnosis or a second process. We thought that a tissue diagnosis was necessary to proceed with therapy.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Robin E. Kirby: The diagnostic procedure was an endoscopic biopsy of the right and left nasal mucosa, right middle turbinate mucosa, and left maxillary antrum. Microscopical examination showed findings that ranged from mild chronic rhinitis to necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis involving small and medium-sized vessels with partial or circumferential involvement of the vessel walls and occasional luminal obliteration ([Figure 4](#f04)). There were also foci of pathergic necrosis within the stroma ([Figure 5](#f05)), a finding that some believe is virtually diagnostic of Wegener's granulomatosis.[46,47](#core-r046) Some tissue and vascular scarring was also present, a finding consistent with the presence of older lesions. Of particular interest was the involvement of small nerve twigs in the scarring process ([Figure 6](#f06)). Special stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi were negative.This case is unusual because of the prominent early symptoms of cranial-nerve involvement, which has been linked to necrotizing vasculitis with subsequent scarring.[42,48](#core-r042) It is thought that initial involvement of nutrient vessels causes ischemic compromise of nerve function. Later, large regions of inflamed tissue expand and compress adjacent vital structures. Finally, in the healing phase, scarring can cause irreversible distortion of normal spatial relations, resulting in permanent dysfunction. If present in the middle ear and cochlear regions, the same sequence of events results in hearing loss, which was experienced by this patient, as well as vertigo. Early diagnosis and intervention are invaluable in preventing long-term morbidity.[49](#core-r049)Dr. Merkel: This patient was treated elsewhere with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, but more cranial neuropathies developed along with cognitive deterioration. He was poorly compliant with the treatment regimen. The patient was subsequently readmitted to this hospital, where he received 1000 mg of methylprednisolone intravenously daily for three days, followed by prednisone administered orally and cyclophosphamide administered intravenously, with excellent results. At last report, he was well. He will continue to be treated with a regimen of glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, as described by Hoffman et al.[50](#core-r050)Dr. Eugene J. Mark: Dr. Kirby mentioned various mechanisms by which the neuropathy may develop \u2014 for example, inflammation and scarring. The speed of the response to therapy may depend on the presence of one of these mechanisms or the other. Was there an abrupt neurologic response to treatment, or was the response more gradual?Dr. Merkel: The patient's condition improved rapidly after he received an intravenous bolus of glucocorticoids, so there was certainly an ongoing inflammatory component. However, scarring can contribute to the damage even after the inflammatory component has been controlled.Dr. Alan Z. Segal: Dr. Merkel, would you comment on the value of monitoring the results of treatment with ANCA testing?Dr. Merkel: The prognostic value of ANCA titers is controversial. The problem is complicated by the lack of international standardization of antibody levels of myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3.Dr. Mark: I am reluctant to group Wegener's granulomatosis with pure forms of vasculitis, since Wegener's granulomatosis is associated with tissue masses, which were prominent in this case, and with primary necrosis of collagen away from blood vessels, as well as with vasculitis.Dr. Simms: Despite the pathological differences, the association of Wegener's granulomatosis and other forms of vasculitis with ANCA suggests that these disorders are related. As more data emerge from the evaluation of ANCA in these disorders, I believe we will see more similarities than differences.\n",

      "question": "Dr. John H. Stone:\nA 47-year-old woman was seen in the Rheumatology Clinic of this hospital because of numbness and pain in the legs and a rash.\nThe patient had been well until approximately 2 years earlier, when numbness developed, first on the lateral aspect of the left leg, ankle, and foot, and then in an identical distribution on the right. Approximately 3 months later, pain developed on the medial aspect of the left foot, followed by pain in the same distribution on the right foot. During the next 9 months, the pain spread to involve both lower legs diffusely. One year before presentation, acute swelling of the distal left leg developed after an airplane trip. Ultrasonography of the legs, performed at another hospital, showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. The swelling subsided spontaneously during a 2-week period. Six to 8 months before this evaluation, mottled discoloration of the skin developed on the feet, ankles, and lower legs, with isolated, tender nodules up to 1.5 cm in diameter that blanched partially with pressure. Intermittent swelling of the legs and ankles occurred. Results of laboratory tests are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nApproximately 8 weeks before presentation, the patient saw a physician at another facility. Levels of serum electrolytes, albumin, globulin, thyrotropin, ferritin, folate, and vitamin B\n12\nand results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal. Results of other laboratory tests are shown in\nTable 1\n. The next day, a dermatologist performed a biopsy of the skin of the left temple. Pathological examination of the specimen reportedly showed perivascular and perifollicular inflammation with telangiectasias, which was thought to be consistent with rosacea-like dermatitis. One week later, pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of a cutaneous nodule on the left ankle reportedly revealed a focal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate around a small muscular artery in the subcutis, with no evidence of vasculitis or erythema nodosum.\nThree weeks before presentation, the patient saw a rheumatologist at another facility. The patient reported a history of dry eyes (for which she used cyclosporine eye drops) and numbness, tingling, and color changes in her fingers in conditions of extreme cold, without digital pallor. The blood pressure was 126/80 mm Hg, the weight 57.8 kg, and the height 163.2 cm. There was mild crepitus on flexion and extension of the knees, without effusions. There were scattered erythematous lesions on the face and anterior portion of the chest that blanched to gentle pressure. There were irregular areas of erythema over the feet and lower legs, which blanched partially with pressure. No nodules were observed. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation were normal. Results of other laboratory tests are shown in\nTable 1\n. One week later, she returned to the rheumatologist because of 3 to 4 days of increased pain and swelling in the left ankle. Slight warmth and mild tenderness to touch were present around the left lateral malleolus, with a rounded, 1-cm area of erythema. The range of motion in both ankles was normal, and there was no evidence of enthesopathy at the insertion of the Achilles' tendon. The plantar fasciae were not tender. There was no sensation to pinprick over either medial malleolus. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal.\nTwo weeks later, she saw a rheumatologist at this hospital. She did not have xerostomia, pain or swelling of the joints, weakness, alopecia, malar rash, oral or tongue ulcers, lymphadenopathy, shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers, night sweats, or a change in weight. She had had varicella in childhood, mild hypertension for 10 years, and a ruptured appendix with peritonitis 15 years earlier. She worked as a consultant, drank alcohol socially, and did not smoke. Her mother had Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, and interstitial lung disease and had died of interstitial lung disease. Her father had a neuropathy when he was elderly. An older sister had been reported within the previous year to have \u201cvasculitis,\u201d which did not appear to be a primary form of either cutaneous or systemic vasculitis. A maternal relative had a history of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, but no details were known. The patient's medications included vitamins, oral contraceptives, and cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion. She was allergic to sulfa medications.\nOn examination, the vital signs were normal. Examination of the skin (\nFigure 1\n) disclosed mottled discoloration from the midcalf distally, which was suggestive of livedo reticularis. A tender, erythematous nodule, 3 cm in diameter, was present just below the left lateral malleolus; two smaller, less tender lesions were present in the same area. There were small porcelain-colored areas on both lower legs, which the patient said corresponded to the locations of previous nodules. There was decreased sensation to light touch over the medial aspects of both feet. There was no capillary dilatation in the nail beds, Raynaud's phenomenon, or joint swelling or deformity. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nComputed tomographic (CT) scanning of the chest and abdomen showed no lymphadenopathy or pulmonary infiltrates. The white-cell count was 3000 per cubic millimeter, with a normal differential count, hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and platelet count; review of a peripheral-blood smear revealed no abnormalities in the white cells, red cells, or platelets.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Daniela Kroshinsky:* This patient presents with a rash compatible with livedo reticularis, tender cutaneous nodules, atrophie blanche, mononeuritis multiplex, and peripheral-blood cytopenias. Serologic testing for rheumatologic diseases has been unrevealing.\n### Livedo Reticularis\n\nOur patient's clinical picture is compatible with livedo reticularis \u2014 a netlike, violaceous discoloration of the skin typically on the legs, which is caused by increased prominence of the venous beds in the skin, either from impediments to arterial inflow, venous dilatation, or obstruction to venous outflow. Livedo reticularis has a broad differential diagnosis ([Table 2](#t02)), [1](#core-r001) which can be focused by considering the patient's personal and family history, the presence or absence of other skin lesions, and laboratory testing. The history should focus on elements that suggest potential autoimmune conditions or thrombotic disorders. This patient's mother had severe complications of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, and the asymmetric leg swelling that the patient had several months before presentation may have represented a thrombotic event, although this was not proved. The skin examination should focus on identifying purpura, nodules, ulcers, scars, nail-fold abnormalities, and alterations in skin temperature. In this patient, nodular skin lesions, atrophie blanche, and a rash on the face were present, in addition to the livedo pattern; I will discuss the implications of these findings later. Laboratory investigation should include a comprehensive hypercoagulability workup and serologic testing for connective-tissue diseases, which were negative in this patient.A skin biopsy could narrow the differential diagnosis further, separating inflammatory from thrombotic processes. Biopsy specimens taken from at least three skin areas, including both the blanched center and the lacy, discolored skin down to the subcutaneous fat, yield a diagnosis in about 80% of cases of livedo reticularis.[2](#core-r002) However, biopsy of a cutaneous nodule would probably have an even higher yield.\n### Atrophie Blanche\n\nThe patient had white, porcelain-like regions of scarring at sites of previous cutaneous nodules. This pattern of scarring, known as atrophie blanche, is characterized by ivory-white, stellate areas, often accompanied by atrophy or sclerosis and often surrounded by hyperpigmented borders and telangiectasias. Atrophie blanche is not specific for any pathologic process and can occur in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, the antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome, livedoid vasculopathy, and cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, as well as in areas of venous stasis and varicosities.[3](#core-r003)\n### Xerophthalmia\n\nOur patient had been undergoing treatment for chronic xerophthalmia, which results from decreased tear production due to lacrimal-gland dysfunction. Although this symptom is most commonly associated with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, it can be seen in other connective-tissue diseases, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, hypothyroidism, and vitamin A deficiency and can be caused by medications such as antihistamines and antidepressants. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome or SLE would be the most likely cause in this patient.\n### Mononeuritis Multiplex\n\nThe patient's numbness and pain indicate involvement of organs beyond the skin \u2014 namely, peripheral nerves. The sequential nature of these lesions is classic for a mononeuritis multiplex \u2014 that is, the dysfunction of individual, named peripheral nerves. Most systemic diseases associated with mononeuritis multiplex, including vasculitides, connective-tissue disease, cryoglobulinemia, sarcoidosis, diabetes, amyloidosis, neoplasms, and infections, cause nerve damage by affecting the vasa nervorum. The combination of livedo reticularis, tender cutaneous nodules, atrophie blanche, and mononeuritis multiplex, together with the peripheral-blood cytopenias, suggest connective-tissue disease, most likely SLE (possibly complicated by Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, the antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome, or both), vasculitis (including cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa), or livedoid vasculopathy. Several of these entities could occur together.\n### Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\n\nCutaneous changes develop in up to 50% of patients with SLE even before they fulfill the minimum American College of Rheumatology criteria for the classification of SLE.[4](#core-r004) This patient's livedo reticularis and subcutaneous nodules are within the spectrum of SLE.[5](#core-r005) Vasculitis develops in up to one third of patients with SLE.[6](#core-r006) Small-vessel vasculitis predominates, but medium-sized\u2013vessel vasculitis also occurs.[6](#core-r006) Small-vessel vasculitis is typified by palpable purpura, which this patient does not have; medium-sized\u2013vessel vasculitis, in contrast, can present with livedo reticularis, mononeuritis multiplex, and ulceration. [5](#core-r005) This patient's clinical findings are most consistent with a medium-sized\u2013vessel vasculitis. Patients with SLE and medium-sized\u2013vessel vasculitis have a higher prevalence of mononeuritis multiplex, visceral vasculitis, and ischemic cutaneous lesions, but they are less likely to have a malar rash or discoid lesions than are patients who have SLE without medium-vessel vasculitis.[6](#core-r006) Ninety-nine percent of patients with SLE have a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) assay.[7](#core-r007) True ANA-negative SLE exists but has become rare since the introduction of testing with the HEp-2 cell substrate.[8](#core-r008) Patients with ANA-negative SLE often have antibodies to the Ro (SS-A) antigen or secondary antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome. This patient could have ANA-negative SLE.\n### Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome\n\nThis patient's keratoconjunctivitis sicca could be a manifestation of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, which is also characterized by peripheral neuropathy (including mononeuritis multiplex) and peripheral-blood cytopenias, among other manifestations.[9\u201311](#core-r009) Classic cases are associated with a positive ANA assay and Ro (SS-A) or La (SS-B) antibodies. [10](#core-r010) The patient's family history of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome increases the likelihood that her clinical findings are due to a connective-tissue disease.[12\u201314](#core-r012)\n### Antiphospholipid-Antibody Syndrome\n\nLivedo reticularis is the most common cutaneous manifestation of the antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome and can present before the development of thrombi within other organs.[15](#core-r015) The antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome can occur either as a primary condition or secondary to a connective-tissue disorder, usually SLE.[16,17](#core-r016) The hematologic features of the antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome may include thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.[17,18](#core-r017) The diagnosis is confirmed by the demonstration of moderate-to-high titers of IgG or IgM anticardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant that are positive on retesting 12 weeks later.[16,17](#core-r016) This patient did not have evidence of anticardiolipin antibodies.\n### Cutaneous Polyarteritis Nodosa\n\nThis patient has painful dermal nodules on the legs, in the area of the malleoli, accompanied by livedo reticularis and ulcerations that heal with atrophie blanche; this constellation of findings is typical of cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa \u2014 a medium-sized\u2013vessel vasculitis that is limited largely to the skin.[5,19](#core-r005) Peripheral-nerve involvement is also described in some patients,[5](#core-r005) and episodes can be accompanied by leg swelling, as in this patient.[5,19](#core-r005) The diagnosis is challenging, because cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa has no distinctive autoantibodies and cannot be identified by other laboratory tests. Elevated levels of acute-phase reactants and a normochromic anemia are detected frequently during active disease, but in contrast to the findings in our patient, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are not typical of cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa.[19](#core-r019)\n### Livedoid Vasculopathy\n\nLivedoid vasculopathy is a segmental, hyalinizing vasculopathy that involves small and medium-sized blood vessels in the lower legs. It can present with livedo changes in the skin, focal purpura, and painful, irregularly shaped lesions around the malleoli. It can be an isolated or a primary condition or can be associated with a variety of hypercoagulable risk factors, including antiphospholipid antibodies, as well as most other serologic and genetic risk factors for either venous or arterial thromboses, and connective-tissue diseases.[20](#core-r020) Our patient's cutaneous findings could be explained by livedoid vasculopathy occurring in the setting of a connective-tissue disorder, the most likely of which would be SLE.\n### Summary\n\nI would review all outside biopsy specimens with a dermatopathologist and, if they are nondiagnostic, repeat the biopsies of both the livedo and a skin nodule. Serologic testing for both connective-tissue disease and antiphospholipid antibodies should be repeated. In addition, I would perform a genetic coagulopathy profile, coagulation tests, serologic testing for hepatitis B and C, and a urinalysis, and I would test for cryoglobulins.*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): Dr. Stone, would you tell us your thinking when you saw the patient?*Dr. Stone:* I considered three major diagnoses: ANA-negative SLE, a hematologic cancer, and cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. The patient had had two negative ANA assays, as well as negative assays for autoantibodies that are more specific for SLE or related disorders. SLE seemed unlikely in view of these results. The normal peripheral-blood smear and unremarkable CT scan were reassuring with regard to hematopoietic malignant conditions. Polyarteritis nodosa would have explained the tender nodules on her lower extremities and the mononeuritis multiplex but would not have accounted for her neutropenia and lymphopenia. Therefore, we referred her for a skin biopsy of the lesion near the left lateral malleolus and repeated the ANA.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Alireza Sepehr:* The biopsy from the left lateral malleolus showed thickening and hyalinization of the small vessels in the dermis ([Figure 2A](#f02)), with foci suggestive of small microthrombi and a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate ([Figure 2A](#f02), inset). No leukocytoclastic vasculitis or fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls was seen. This morphologic picture is diagnostic of livedoid vasculopathy.Livedoid vasculopathy is characterized histologically by a thin and flattened epidermis, segmental hyalinization of small vessels in the superficial dermis, endothelial swelling, and dilated capillaries with tortuous loops. Extravasation of red cells with or without hemosiderin, microthrombi, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates are typical. The absence of fibrinoid necrosis and inflammation of the vessel wall differentiates this condition from the vasculitides.[21,22](#core-r021) The pathophysiology of this condition is not fully understood, and hypotheses include formation of fibrin cuffs around small vessels due to fibrin leakage in chronic venous insufficiency, white-cell trapping and activation and subsequent endothelial damage secondary to venous hypertension, and activation of the procoagulant pathway by antiphospholipid antibodies; different combinations of these mechanisms may be operative in different clinical settings.[3,23](#core-r003) The damage to small cutaneous veins probably produces the clinical picture of livedo reticularis ([Figure 3](#f03)).*Dr. Stone:* The diagnosis of livedoid vasculopathy prompted us to reevaluate the coagulation tests. The anticardiolipin antibody (IgG) level was markedly elevated (42.3 IgG phospholipid units; reference range, 0 to 15). The remainder of the hypercoagulation workup was negative, except for a slightly decreased level of protein S, which can be seen in patients using oral contraceptives. We requested repeated ANA testing, and we asked for a review of the outside pathological slides.*Dr. Donald B. Bloch:* On repeat testing at this hospital, ANAs were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay (titer, 1:1280), in a speckled pattern. Subsequently, antibody to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was detected (titer, 1:40); enzyme immunoassays for antibodies to Ro (SS-A), La (SS-B), Smith, and U1-RNP were negative. A second serum sample from this patient was retested in our laboratory, and the positive ANA result was confirmed.One potential explanation for the conflicting results is that ANAs developed during the 8-week interval between previous testing and the patient's presentation here. However, in patients with SLE, the autoantibodies usually develop many months or years before the development of symptoms of SLE.[24](#core-r024) Thus, it seems unlikely that ANAs developed during the 8-week interval. Moreover, a subsequent sample sent to the same commercial laboratory was still reported to be negative for ANAs.The most likely explanation for the conflicting ANA results in this case is the use of different screening tests for ANAs. The Clinical Immunology Laboratory at this hospital uses indirect immunofluorescence and a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line (HEp-2) to screen for ANAs. At dilutions of 1:40 and 1:160, indirect immunofluorescence is reported to be positive in 97% and 95% of patients with SLE, respectively.[25](#core-r025) The commercial laboratory that tested this patient's serum for ANAs uses a flow cytometry\u2013based solid-phase screening assay, in which colored polystyrene beads coated with autoantigens are mixed with the patient's serum, incubated with fluorescein-conjugated antihuman IgG, and examined with the use of a dual-laser flow cytometer to detect both the color of the bead and the amount of autoantibody coating the bead. The flow cytometry\u2013based kit contains nine different-colored beads coated with defined autoantigens: Ro, La, Sm, U1-RNP, Scl-70, Jo-1, Cenp-B, dsDNA, and histones. A 10th bead is coated with material extracted from HEp-2 cell nuclei. A serum sample is reported as having ANAs if it contains autoantibodies directed against at least 1 of the 10 coated beads. The details of how the antigens are produced, purified, linked to the beads, and tested for stability are trade secrets. HEp-2 cells contain many more than the nine autoantigens linked to the fluorescent beads. Whether these other autoantigens are well represented in the HEp-2 nuclear extract on the 10th bead is not known. Important epitopes may be altered or lost during the process of conjugation of the antigens to the beads.This patient's experience suggests that the change in testing methods may result in failure to diagnose systemic autoimmune disease. Recent reports suggest that the sensitivity of a positive fluorescent-bead assay for the diagnosis of SLE may be as low as 49 to 58%.[26,27](#core-r026) This case illustrates the importance to the clinician of knowing how the laboratory performs the screening test for ANAs. If SLE or another systemic autoimmune disease is suspected but the ANA screening test by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or fluorescent-bead\u2013based assay is negative, then the test should be repeated using indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cell substrate.*Dr. Sepehr:* Two skin biopsies performed before the patient's evaluation at this hospital were reviewed, and the findings were consistent with a connective-tissue disease. The biopsy specimen from the left ankle showed extensive deposition of dermal mucin and a lymphocytic infiltrate around the middle and deep dermal vessels ([Figure 2B](#f02)). A biopsy specimen from the temple area also showed deposition of mucin in the dermis, interface dermatitis at the dermoepidermal junction, and periadnexal and perineural lymphocytic inflammation ([Figure 2C](#f02)). The combination of the findings in the three biopsies, the positive ANA assay, the antibody to dsDNA, and the elevated levels of IgG anticardiolipin antibody supports a diagnosis of livedoid vasculopathy associated with SLE.\n\nDiscussion of Management\n------------------------\n\n*Dr. Stone:* The treatment of livedoid vasculopathy remains highly empiric. Habits such as smoking and medications such as oral contraceptives are strongly discouraged. This patient discontinued her oral contraceptives. Active interventions generally are designed to interfere with platelet function, interrupt other components of the clotting cascade, or treat an underlying condition such as a known hypercoagulable state[28](#core-r028) or SLE. The spectrum of agents targeting blood clotting ranges from \u201cbaby aspirin\u201d to tissue plasminogen activator and includes warfarin, dipyridamole, and heparin.[21](#core-r021) When SLE and the antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome are present, hydroxychloroquine and warfarin must be considered.We opted to treat the patient with baby aspirin and hydroxychloroquine and planned to use warfarin if she did not respond to the initial treatment. Four months after presentation, the development of new cutaneous nodules had ceased, the livedoid appearance of the legs had resolved, and both the pain and numbness had improved.*Dr. Harris:* The patient is here today, and I would like to invite her to comment on her experience.*The Patient:* By the time I saw Dr. Stone, I was virtually bedridden. It seemed like an eternity. My improvement was very gradual, but after about 3 or 4 weeks of treatment, the swelling and then the pain subsided. When I came to Boston \u2014 which happens to be my favorite city \u2014 to see Dr. Stone, I couldn't walk or go to museums. Yesterday, as I walked through the Boston Common, virtually pain-free, I thought, \u201cWhat a miracle!\u201d It was a circuitous route to the diagnosis, with false negative laboratory tests and skin biopsies not interpreted correctly, but despite the fact that so many things went wrong, I have had a wonderful result.*Dr. Margaret Seton* (Rheumatology): Dr. Stone, how can you be sure this is not Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome?*Dr. Stone:* As rheumatologists, we become comfortable with our inability to render precise diagnoses in all patients. In this case, there are two things, the positive dsDNA antibodies and the cutaneous findings, that are consistent with lupus. Although she could have both lupus and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, we do not think a lip biopsy (which, if positive, can confirm a diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome) is justified at this point.*Dr. Dwight Robinson* (Rheumatology): Did you consider using corticosteroids?*Dr. Stone:* In view of the presence of both coagulopathy and livedoid vasculopathy, I thought that the treatment decision was between something on the milder side, such as aspirin and hydroxychloroquine, or full-dose anticoagulation with warfarin. We opted to go with the baby aspirin and the hydroxychloroquine, and the patient has done very well. One year after the diagnosis, the ANA assay was positive at 1:320 and the anti-dsDNA at 1:10, and the IgG anticardiolipin antibody level was 26.9 IgG phospholipid units. The pain and swelling have resolved, and she has residual numbness over both medial malleoli.\n",

      "question": "A seventy-nine-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of a mass in the jaw.\nHe had been well until eight months previously, when a swelling appeared beneath his lower denture. Examination at the Tumor Clinic two months later revealed a fungating lesion on the anterior portion of the lower gingiva and 2 hard lymph nodes, 1 by 2 cm., in the left submandibular area; a biopsy disclosed a squamous-cell carcinoma. Irradiation resulted in temporary regression, but during the three months before entry the mass increased in size.\nThe patient had lost 17 pounds in weight during the year before admission. An abscess in the left submandibular region had been incised and drained at the age of nine years, and calcified cervical lymph nodes were subsequently demonstrated on x-ray examination.\nPhysical examination revealed an elderly man who appeared chronically ill. A fungating growth involved the anterior portion of the mandible from the base of the tongue to the lower lip. Two hard lymph nodes were palpable in the left submandibular area, and there was brawny edema of the skin over the anterior surface of the lower jaw. The lungs, heart and abdomen were normal. The prostate gland was enlarged, and a hard nodule was felt in the lower pole of the left lobe.\nThe temperature was 99\u00b0F., the pulse 82, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 170 systolic, 75 diastolic.\nThe urine gave a + test for glucose; the sediment contained an occasional red cell and 10 white cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 41 per cent; the white-cell count was 7800, with 89 per cent neutrophils. The urea nitrogen was 17 mg., the calcium 9.2 mg., the phosphorus 2.8 mg., the glucose 78 mg., and the protein 6.2 gm. (the albumin 5.6 gm., and the globulin 0.6 gm.) per 100 ml. The alkaline phosphatase was 1.7 Sigma units, the acid phosphatase 0.28 unit, and the prothrombin content 70 per cent. X-ray films of the chest disclosed prominence of the left cardiac border, although the transverse cardiac diameter was normal; the aorta was elongated and tortuous; the lungs were clear except for old scarring at the base of the left lung. Films of the jaw revealed an irregular area of destruction of the superior aspect of the right mandible anteriorly. Films of the bones showed mild degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine; no metastatic lesions were recognized.\nOn the sixth hospital day the floor of the mouth, the anterior portion of the tongue, the inferior mandibular rami and the supra-omohyoid lymph nodes were resected in contiguity, and a plastic reconstruction was performed, together with a tracheostomy; 3 blood transfusions were given. Microscopical examination of the excised tissues showed squamous-cell carcinoma; the resection margin and the 4 lymph nodes removed were free of tumor. Respiratory assistance was provided because of repeated apneic episodes during the early postoperative period. Urinary retention developed; repeated attempts to pass a catheter were unsuccessful, and on the seventh hospital day a suprapubic cystostomy was performed. One unit of dextran and 2 units of plasma were infused; the urinary volume was satisfactory. An x-ray film of the chest disclosed a diffuse density in the right-upper-lung field extending to the pleural surface, with an air bronchogram; the left lung appeared clear except for the scarring at the base. An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 90, with inversion of the T waves and moderate depression of the ST segments in Leads V\n3\nthrough V\n6\n. The hematocrit was 32 per cent. Penicillin was begun, and 2 transfusions of whole blood were given. On the following morning the hematocrit was 45 per cent, and the white-cell count 6600. The urea nitrogen was 31 mg. per 100 ml.; the sodium was 126 milliequiv., the potassium 3.9 milliequiv., and the carbon dioxide 22 milliequiv., per liter. A serum electrophoretic study showed a normal pattern. On the ninth hospital day the temperature rose to 101\u00b0F., and greenish-yellow sputum drained from the tracheostomy. An x-ray film of the chest showed areas of consolidation in the lower lobes and patchy infiltrates in the right upper and middle lobes; a small amount of fluid was evident in both pleural spaces. On the following day a culture of the sputum disclosed absence of the normal throat flora and an abundant growth of\nStaphylococcus aureus\nand herellea species. During the next four days the temperature fell to 99.4\u00b0F., and the lungs became clear on auscultation. The penicillin therapy was discontinued.\nOn the fifteenth hospital day the patient complained of dull, nonpleuritic pain in the anterior portion of the chest, extending from the right to the left side, and four hours later the pulse rate suddenly rose to 140. Physical examination disclosed diminished tubular breath sounds over the right-lung base posteriorly and sticky inspiratory rales at the left-lung base. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, with a ventricular rate of 180 and rare ventricular ectopic beats. Digoxin was given intravenously, and methicillin (Staphcillin) was begun. A daily regimen of basic tube feeding, 800 to 1200 ml., and water, 1600 to 2100 ml., administered via a nasogastric tube, was instituted. The temperature ranged between 99 and 100\u00b0F. On the nineteenth hospital day examination of the thorax disclosed dullness over the lower two thirds on the right side. X-ray films of the chest (\nFig. 1\n) demonstrated pleural effusions bilaterally and persistence of the consolidations in the lower lobes; small areas of atelectasis were visible at the base of the left lung. A thoracentesis yielded 725 ml. of yellowish fluid slightly stained with blood; the protein content of the fluid was 3.4 gm. (the albumin 2.0 gm., and the globulin 1.4 gm.) per 100 ml., the glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) 50 units, and the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 363 units; a culture yielded no bacterial growth.\nOn the following day the patient was lethargic and semiresponsive. The sodium was 111 milliequiv., and the potassium 4.7 milliequiv. per liter; the urea nitrogen was 23 mg., and the glucose 50 mg. per 100 ml. An infusion of glucose was given by vein, followed by 500 ml. of 3 per cent sodium chloride, and ventilation was maintained by a respirator. On the twenty-first hospital day the temperature was 101.4\u00b0F., and yellow sputum issued from the tracheostomy. The hematocrit was 32 per cent; the white-cell count was 6490, with 78 per cent neutrophils. The glucose was 135 mg. per 100 ml.; the sodium was 127 milliequiv., and the potassium 5.0 milliequiv. per liter. A specimen of urine contained 81 milliequiv. of sodium and 59 milliequiv. of potassium per liter, and the osmolality was 447 milliosmoles per liter; in a specimen of serum obtained simultaneously the osmolality was 288 milliosmoles per liter. The urea nitrogen was 19 mg., the calcium 6.6 mg., and the phosphorus 1.5 mg. per 100 ml. Infusions of human plasma protein fraction (Plasmanate) and one dose of hydrocortisone, 100 mg., were given by vein, and chloramphenicol was begun. On the next moning he was more alert and no longer required ventilatory assistance. The hematocrit was 38 per cent, and the white-cell count 17,400. A wound culture, begun four days earlier, yielded an abundant growth of\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (Bacillus pyocyaneus)\nand\nEscherichia coli\n. Infusions of isotonic and hypotonic saline solution were administered. Later in the day pulmonary edema developed. The administration of morphine, oxygen and meralluride (Mercuhydrin ) caused improvement. The dullness over the lower portion of the right hemithorax persisted, and an x-ray film of the chest disclosed pulmonary congestion and edema, bilateral pleural effusions and consolidation in both lower lobes. A culture of the tracheal aspirate yielded abundant aerobacter organisms and yeasts.\nThe temperature remained between 100 and 101\u00b0F. The daily fluid intake ranged between 3000 and 4000 ml., and the urinary volume between 1500 and 1700 ml. On the twenty-third hospital day the pulmonary signs were unchanged, and there was + + + sacral edema. The creatinine was 1.0 mg., and the protein 4.6 gm. (the albumin 2.9 gm., and the globulin 1.7 gm.) per 100 ml. The sodium was 134 milliequiv., the potassium 4.1 milliequiv., and the carbon dioxide 30 milliequiv. per liter. The alkaline phosphatase was 3.8 Sigma units. During the next two days pulmonary edema of varying degree recurred as infusions containing saline were administered. After meralluride was again given the twenty-four-hour urinary volume rose to 2250 ml. On the twenty-sixth hospital day the urea nitrogen was 17 mg., and the protein 4.7 gm. (the albumin 2.6 gm., and the globulin 2.1 gm.) per 100 ml. The sodium was 136 milliequiv., the potassium 5.1 milliequiv., and the carbon dioxide 30 milliequiv. per liter.\nOn the morning of the thirty-second hospital day the blood pressure fell to 90 systolic, 40 diastolic. Rales and rhonchi were audible throughout the lower half of both lung fields, and a large amount of blood-tinged, sticky mucus was aspirated from the tracheostomy. The systolic pressure remained at 90. The patient died several hours later.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Alexander Leaf\\*: I suggest that we begin by reviewing the x-ray films. I am particularly interested in the preoperative films of the chest and those taken at the time of the onset of infection.Dr. Derek J. Goodman: On the films of the chest taken on admission the heart has a normal transverse diameter, but the left cardiac border is prominent, indicating left ventricular hypertrophy. The right lung is clear. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated, and at the base of the left lung there is linear scarring resulting from past infection. I see no evidence of a pleural effusion. A film taken shortly after the operation reveals consolidation in the right upper lobe. The examination performed three days later shows partial clearing of that process, but we now see a patchy consolidation at both lung bases, with the development of a pleural effusion on the right side. The left costophrenic angle is blunted, indicating a small effusion on that side as well. The films taken on the nineteenth hospital day ([Fig. 1](#f001)) demonstrate an increase in the effusion on the right side and persistence of the consolidation at both bases. The last film shows widespread pulmonary edema; the right pleural effusion and the small effusion in the left pleural space persist.Dr. Leaf: The events described in this case were unfortunate but perhaps predictable. This seventy-nine-year-old man had extensive involvement of the mandible by a neoplasm, and its resection led to difficulties that required a tracheostomy, with the subsequent development of repeated episodes of pulmonary infection. Because of his advanced age he undoubtedly lacked cardiac reserve, and the administration of fluids resulted in overloading of the circulation and eventuated in pulmonary edema. I shall accept without question the pathological report that the tumor in the mandible was a squamous-cell carcinoma. In other respects the course was not very distinctive, as judged by the case record. There could, of course, have been one or more obscure diseases underlying the obvious problems that the patient had, but I think that the events can be explained on the basis of the straightforward complications of pulmonary infection and congestive heart failure. The single attack of pain in the chest may have reflected pulmonary infarction, but I believe that he died as a result of the respiratory infection with superimposed congestive heart failure.Among the features of this case that deserve further discussion are the findings in the pleural fluid. At the time of the thoracentesis the pleural cavity contained 725 ml. of fluid with a high protein concentration, which is suggestive of an exudate and consistent with the presence of pulmonary infection. We are not given the cell counts in the fluid, but we do have some interesting information from the enzyme assays. I've learned as a result of this case that in pleural or serous effusions the SGOT level tends to remain low, as low as or lower than the levels in the blood, but with certain types of pleural effusion, those secondary to involvement of the pleural cavity by most tumors, the LDH level is elevated and is higher in the pleural fluid than the concomitant value obtained from the serum.[1](#core-r001) To make a valid interpretation of the former one must have a simultaneous serum analysis, which is lacking in this case. The LDH level in the pleural fluid was 363 units, whereas the upper limit of normal in our laboratory is 100 units. However, I cannot say that the high level was evidence of a tumor because as leukocytes die and red cells break up they also liberate lactic dehydrogenase into the surrounding fluid. Therefore, I am unable to regard that finding as indicative of anything more than a probable bacterial pleural effusion secondary to the infection and congestion in the lungs that were demonstrated on the x-ray films.Of particular interest is the development of hyponatremia in this man. On the twentieth day of the hospital course the serum sodium concentration was 111 milliequiv. per liter. A few comments about hyponatremia in general might be worthwhile. In a person with normal renal function and normal blood flow to the kidney the capacity to excrete water is enormous. Dilution of the serum results in inhibition of secretion of antidiuretic hormone, and in this state one has a functional diabetes insipidus. The kidney then can excrete large volumes of extremely dilute fluid and promptly rid the body of the water load. However, when this normal situation is modified clinically so that administered water isn't excreted as rapidly as it is given the result is hyponatremia.There are several clinical conditions in which we see hyponatremia.[2](#core-r002) First of all, it occurs in association with contraction of the extracellular-fluid volume because of sodium depletion. That is the situation that we see commonly whenever a normal person loses sodium excessively. If you or I received a mercurial diuretic and had sodium extracted from us or if we lost sodium because of perspiration, vomiting or diarrhea, the extracellular-fluid volume would contract as a result of the loss of sodium. The intravascular volume would participate in the reduction of the extracellular volume and become insufficient to perfuse the kidneys adequately. As a result, a water load would not be excreted normally. The normal human response to contraction of the extracellular-fluid volume and the intravascular-fluid volume is to retain water in excess of sodium and dilute the serum sodium concentration. So if water is available to a sodium-depleted person, regardless of the cause of the sodium depletion hyponatremia will develop.This situation most frequently occurs in association with gastrointestinal-fluid losses and sweat-sodium losses, but we also see this type of total sodium depletion in patients who have renal disease with a sodium-wasting syndrome and with failure of hormonal regulation of sodium reabsorption in the kidney \u2014 namely, in adrenal failure or Addison's disease. The clinical picture is that of decreased extracellular-fluid volume. The skin turgor is diminished, the eyeballs may be sunken and are proverbially soft to pressure, the blood pressure is usually a little low, the pulse is increased, the mucous membranes appear dry, and the hematocrit is a little elevated. Because of the reduced blood flow and decreased perfusion of the kidneys the glomerular filtration rate is reduced, and the serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels may be slightly elevated.What is the reason for water retention in these patients despite dilution of the body fluids? Under normal circumstances dilution of the body fluids results in the excretion of water, whereas in certain situations the body is unable to respond by excreting water. It seems probable that two mechanisms are involved. First, but probably of least importance, we know that an acute compromise of the intravascular volume results in secretion of an antidiuretic hormone that will cause water to be retained. Secondly, because of the decreased perfusion of the kidneys and the stimulus for increased sodium reabsorption much of the filtered fluid is reabsorbed in the proximal portions of the kidney, and very little sodium-containing fluid gets down to the distal portions of the nephrons. It is in this distal portion of the nephron that sodium is reabsorbed from water, leaving \"free water\" to be excreted to get rid of the water load. So, if isotonic sodium chloride is reabsorbed proximally and little gets into the distal portions of the nephrons a person is unable to excrete \"free water,\" which is retained, and the serum sodium concentration decreases. We know that an agent such as mannitol that will bring sodium into the distal portion of the nephron will result in an increase in the clearance of \"free water\" and allow the kidneys to discharge the water load and correct the serum sodium concentration, but it is obvious that the ideal therapy in this situation is simply to replace the sodium that is deficient.We see the same pathophysiologic mechanism in patients with congestive heart failure who have insufficient intravascular volume or insufficient circulation. There is no question that the difficulty is due to too little sodium in such cases because there clearly is too much sodium in the body. These patients are edematous, and the edema is extracellular fluid containing sodium. There may be a huge excess of sodium, but the fact that the circulation is insufficient as a result of the decreased cardiac output makes these people respond with the same mechanisms for retaining water and salt that are evoked in the normal person with an absolute depletion of sodium. They, too, are unable to excrete \"free water,\" and if too much water is injudiciously given these persons will retain it and become hyponatremic.Many of the clinical features of the case under discussion fit into this picture. However, as part of the syndrome one expects to see an edematous patient who is excreting no sodium in the urine. Since the kidneys in this condition are retaining sodium, virtually no sodium should be present in the urine if the renal function was normal before the occurrence of heart failure. The only determination of the urinary sodium level reported gave a high value of 81 milliequiv. per liter, which is incompatible with the view that simple congestive heart failure alone was responsible for the hyponatremia. A renal tubular salt-wasting syndrome or adrenal failure would have to be invoked in addition to account for this finding. However, in the presence of renal sodium wasting of the degree suggested by the single report of the urinary sodium concentration I would not expect congestion and overexpansion of the extracellular-fluid volume to be the problem in management that it apparently was. We are not told when that sample of urine was obtained, and it is possible that it was collected in close proximity to the infusion of hypertonic saline solution or to the administration of a diuretic agent. I don't think I can give much weight to it.We find this type of insufficient circulation in association with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis and the nephrotic syndrome, all of which may be responsible for a functionally inadequate volume within the intravascular compartment despite the presence of too much fluid in the interstitial spaces.Another condition that must be mentioned with regard to this patient is the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. In that situation there is an entirely different sequence of events. The primary disorder is an excess of antidiuretic hormone, causing water retention. Initially, nothing is wrong with the volume of fluid in the body or its distribution, and the circulation is normal. If one administers antidiuretic hormone so that ingested water has to be retained because the kidney can't put out dilute urine, then an increase in the total body water occurs. Concomitantly, the extracellular-fluid volume expands, shutting off the mechanisms for conserving sodium. This combination of requisite or obligatory water retention as a consequence of the antidiuretic-hormone effect on the kidneys and failure to conserve sodium because of increased glomerular filtration of sodium and decreased secretion of aldosterone results in marked hyponatremia due to water retention and the loss of sodium in the urine. The hallmark of this syndrome is the presence of severe hyponatremia in a patient who has no primary disturbance in the circulation. The cardiac output is good, the perfusion of the kidneys is supernormal, and the serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels remain normal. Despite the hyponatremia, there will always be significant amounts of sodium in the urine if its intake is not restricted. On the other hand, if the dietary sodium is restricted the urinary sodium losses will be reduced, and thus one can rely on the expected presence of sodium in the urine only if one knows the sodium intake of these patients.So much, then, for the physiologic and clinical situations in which we see hyponatremia. How much of this discourse applies to the present case? We can surmise that this seventy-nine-year-old man, who had one episode of spontaneous atrial fibrillation, had a reduced cardiac reserve. He was given digitalis. He had a pleural effusion, which was sterile but did contain a large amount of protein, suggesting that it was an exudate rather than a transudate. However, the cardiac decompensation may have contributed to the development of the pleural fluid, since the last film of the chest showed considerable pulmonary congestion in addition to the infection throughout the lungs. Therefore, I can't dismiss the possibility that the major difficulty was that a patient with a reduced cardiac output and defective circulation was given, over a fairly long period, a quantity of fluid considerably in excess of both his needs and his ability to excrete it. We are told that the daily fluid intake was between 3000 and 4000 ml., administered to what appears from the x-ray films to have been a very small elderly man. In view of the impaired cardiac function one might have expected him to have difficulty in excreting the water and to become hyponatremic.Once this situation develops, what can be done about it? The most important measure is to reduce further fluid intake and let the insensible loss of fluid through the lungs and the skin correct the hyponatremia. As the amount of water in the body is reduced the serum sodium concentration will rise. In this case hypertonic saline solution was administered. That can be done in acute situations in patients with a good cardiac reserve, but in patients with underlying cardiac embarrassment it is very apt to result in further overexpansion of the extracellular-fluid volume and an increase in pulmonary edema, with concomitant further impairment of the myocardial function as a result of anoxia. This man seemed to rally temporarily, but then more pulmonary infection and more pulmonary edema developed. He was apparently given relatively large amounts of salt in the intravenously administered fluids. Finally, the pulmonary edema became more severe, and he died. So it is my suspicion that the primary difficulty was impaired cardiac function, and that the hyponatremia was on the basis of the administration of too much water in conjunction with the inability to excrete water that is associated with congestive heart failure. However, the serum creatinine remained 1.0 mg., the urea nitrogen never exceeded 31 mg. per 100 ml., and, most significantly perhaps, a spot check of the urine, obtained while the patient was presumably still hyponatremic, revealed 81 milliequiv. of sodium per liter of urine. These findings are suggestive of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. That may be the explanation, of course, but the possibility that the urine was collected during the period of administration of 3 per cent saline solution makes it difficult to evaluate the significance of that one urinary sodium value. Even if he did have the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, the crux of the therapy in that situation, just as in treating hyponatremia associated with congestive heart failure, is restriction of water. If one gives antidiuretic hormone but does not give water one can avoid overexpansion of the extracellular-fluid volume and put an abrupt stop to the sequence of events that results in hyponatremia.I shall summarize by saying that this seventy-nine-year-old man, who underwent extensive surgery for removal of a squamous-cell carcinoma of the mandible, was unable to survive the not unusual subsequent complications of pulmonary infection, perhaps with pulmonary infarction, and congestive heart failure secondary to coronary-artery disease.Dr. M. Henry Clifford: Would you consider the hypoproteinemia a factor in the etiology of the hyponatremia?Dr. Leaf: It probably contributed to it. Anything that diminishes the effective intravascular volume, whether it's the inability of the heart to put enough blood into the circulation or the presence of too little oncotic pressure to hold fluid in the intravascular compartment so that the volume shrinks, will contribute in the same way. The physicians taking care of this patient wisely tried to correct the probable deficiency of intravascular colloid by giving whole blood, dextran and human plasma protein fraction (Plasmanate). But again, if one is dealing with a patient with congestive heart failure one is necessarily limited in the administration of oncotic, osmotically active substances intravascularly because of the potentiality of further embarrassment of the cardiac function.Dr. Morton N. Swartz: Will you comment on the serum glucose level of 50 mg. per 100 ml. in the context of the parallel hyponatremia?Dr. Leaf: The sample was taken at a time when the patient hadn't received any food for some time, and it probably was just the result of the lack of caloric intake.Dr. Walter T. St. Goar: What about the low levels of calcium and phosphorus?Dr. Leaf: At the time of admission, before the parenteral administration of fluids, the calcium level was normal; the phosphorus was a little low at 2.8 mg. per 100 ml. However, there wasn't any derangement to go along with the slight reduction in the serum phosphate level, either in the bones or in the alkaline phosphatase values. The low calcium levels that appear after a considerable volume of fluid has been given parenterally have to be interpreted with caution because the serum calcium content can fluctuate widely without being of significance as far as a disturbance in the metabolism of phosphorus and calcium is concerned.Dr. Benjamin Castleman: Dr. Swartz, do you have any other thoughts about this case from the standpoint of infection?Dr. Swartz: The mention of calcified lymph nodes in the neck in the area that had been incised and drained many years ago made me wonder whether dissemination of a tuberculous process had occurred, but the story as a whole, including the x-ray picture that seems characteristic of bacterial pneumonia, makes that diagnosis unlikely.Dr. Leaf: I am aware that there might have been a number of things hidden under the bacterial infection that I'm missing entirely. Perhaps I've taken the wrong part of the bear to shake it by.Dr. Frank F. Davidoff: I helped in the care of this patient on the Surgical Service. The calculated sodium intake from the tube feeding, which actually was a blended meal rather than a basic tube feeding, was about 50 milliequiv. per day in approximately 2 liters. We thought that the administration of such a highly hypotonic solution in combination with the congestive heart failure accounted for the hyponatremia.Dr. Leaf: I didn't mean to be critical of the management of this case specifically, but as I see the current use of intravenous therapy, especially in elderly patients, I have the impression that a number of them receive more fluid than is desirable. We tend to get into a vicious cycle. The patient gets a little too much water for the amount of sodium, becomes hyponatremic and then gets a little more sodium, and all these things going into a body with a limited capacity for things to come out results in overexpansion of the body fluids and congestive heart failure. In the older age group we're often dealing with a very fragile circulatory system that has a marked reduction in the ability to respond in an elastic manner to excessive fluids, as a younger patient would.Dr. H. Walter Jones, Jr.: If you were managing the care of a patient like this, how concerned would you be about the low serum sodium content? How vigorously would you try to raise it and to what level?Dr. Leaf: Our usual tendency is to ignore hyponatremia, but it depends upon the context in which the hyponatremia develops, of course. Normal persons \u2014 namely, ourselves \u2014 had no symptoms whatsoever after we experimentally took vasopressin and ingested water until the serum sodium got down to a level of approximately 117 milliequiv. per liter, whereupon the symptomatology was merely that of a sensation of fullness in the head, with inability to maintain a span of attention for very long, and then a little anorexia and nausea and perhaps vomiting. Hyponatremia per se doesn't ordinarily cause marked concern until the sodium level gets down to about 110 milliequiv. per liter, when the patient may become unresponsive and comatose. In that situation I would advise giving a small amount of hypertonic saline solution, enough to bring the serum sodium level up to around 120 milliequiv. per liter, but then it is important to withhold further water. If one stops giving water and allows the patient to use the excessive water already available to maintain the insensible loss and the obligatory urinary volume, the serum sodium level will gradually come back up. If hyponatremia develops in association with congestive heart failure it is usually an ominous sign and in our experience means a grim prognosis. Under those circumstances we prefer to do nothing but restrict water intake and concentrate attention on possible ways to correct the underlying heart failure. If one can improve the cardiac function the hyponatremia will correct itself. If the patient is already overexpanded with fluid and is hyponatremic, the possibility of effecting improvement by giving hypertonic saline solution is very small, and the possibility of producing fatal pulmonary edema is very great.Dr. Swartz: A number of years ago the occurrence of hypochloremia and hyponatremia in patients with pneumococcal lobar pneumonia was observed. In recent years there has been interest in the occasional occurrence, in association with pneumonia and in the absence of tumor, of a disorder resembling the Schwartz\u2014Bartter syndrome.[2,3](#core-r002) Will you comment on these two states?Dr. Leaf: That's an interesting point. In the days before the advent of sulfa drugs pneumonia was associated with a drop in the serum chloride level; sodium values weren't readily obtainable. At that time the clinicians appreciated the fact that with the crisis that frequently occurred with pneumococcal pneumonia an early change was a diuresis with a rise in the serum chloride level. Thus, the improvement was heralded by the correction of this hyponatremic situation. We have seen patients with bacterial pneumonia, usually pneumococcal lobar pneumonia, who have manifested all the criteria for the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone as a result of pulmonary infection, although the classic setting for this syndrome as described by Schwartz and Bartter is a pulmonary neoplasm. What the source of the antidiuretic hormone is with pulmonary infection I don't know.Dr. Arnold N. Weinberg: In regard to the etiology of the infectious process in this case, it would be of interest to know the cell count in the pleural fluid, and also whether there was necrosis in the area of the tumor or any odor of the sputum or the pleural fluid and whether material was cultured anaerobically. With a tumor of the mouth, particularly with necrosis, one ought to consider organisms that are associated with the indigenous oral flora, such as the anaerobic fusobacteria, bacteroides and actinomycetes, as well as the more familiar streptococci. A foul odor of the sputum or aspirated pleural fluid may be an important clue to the presence of anaerobic pathogens and guide the physician to request special cultures.Dr. Castleman: We don't have any more information along these lines.Dr. Hugh H. Kopald: The student discussion, as did Dr. Leaf's, centered on the hyponatremia. All the students thought that this man had inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, and all but one thought that he had a tumor in the lungs. One student made a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. Mr. John Ludden and Miss Pidot were the discussers.Miss Ann Pidot: Mr. Ludden and I were in agreement that this patient probably had inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone on the basis of either a bronchogenic carcinoma or possibly tuberculosis.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Sanford I. Roth: A probable cause of the hyponatremia in this patient was bilateral massive adrenal hemorrhage. At autopsy the combined weight of the adrenal glands was 42 gm. Dark-red blood clot completely replaced the medulla, and there was apparent pressure on the remaining thinned-out cortex ([Fig. 2](#f002)). On microscopical examination of the adrenal glands the massive hemorrhage observed grossly completely obliterated the medulla and inner cortex. The middle and outer fascicular zones were not involved by hemorrhage but were extensively necrotic, as was most of the zona glomerulosa. The necrosis was accompanied by karyorrhectic debris and an infiltrate of polymorphonuclear leukocytes ([Fig. 3](#f003)). Isolated foci of glomerulosa remained structurally intact. The actual cause of death was severe, acute bilateral bronchopneumonia. There was no residual tumor or active tuberculosis.We are left with two unanswered questions. First, is it possible to explain the hyponatremia on the basis of the bilateral adrenal hemorrhage? Second, what is the etiology of the adrenal hemorrhage? In a recent study[4](#core-r004) bilateral adrenal hemorrhage was induced with one dose of endotoxin in animals after ACTH had been administered to raise the serum cortisone level. In contrast, two doses of endotoxin, which are used to produce the experimental Shwartzman reaction, in most cases do not cause adrenal hemorrhage. These observations led to the hypothesis that the mechanism of the adrenocortical hemorrhage in patients with septicemia is the endotoxemia in the presence of adrenal glands with high cortisone levels resulting from stress-induced ACTH secretion. On that basis, the source of the endotoxin in this case would be the pulmonary infection. Admittedly, this reasoning is speculative, and I should like to hear what the experts think.Dr. Castleman: Dr. Leaf, do you wish to comment on the role that the adrenal hemorrhage may have played?Dr. Leaf: One should always pay due respect to the adrenal cortex when faced with the problem of hyponatremia. Was the glomerulosa fairly well preserved?Dr. Roth: In most areas the entire cortex was gone. In the rare areas where it was preserved it was predominantly glomerulosa, which is, of course, the source of the mineralocorticoids.Dr. Leaf: If the hyponatremia developed on about the twentieth hospital day, approximately two weeks before the patient died, it is possible that the episode that produced the adrenal hemorrhage occurred after the hyponatremic episode. I don't think we can say for sure. Very little functioning glomerulosa is required to maintain sufficient aldosterone activity to allow sodium conservation.Dr. Roth: Of course, it is difficult to date the onset of the hemorrhage and necrosis in the adrenal cortex.Dr. Leaf: Perhaps the most suggestive bit of evidence of a hypoadrenal state earlier is the point that Dr. Swartz raised about the blood sugar level being down to 50 mg. per 100 ml. However, in someone who hasn't been eating such a level can occur.Dr. Kopald: With reference to a possible hypoadrenal state in this patient, are you surprised that the blood urea nitrogen level did not go up higher? It was only 19 mg. per 100 ml. at the time when he was hyponatremic.Dr. Leaf: One would expect it to be higher with adrenal failure severe enough to cause hyponatremia of the degree that was observed, but this is not a very reliable feature in an elderly, wasted patient.Dr. Castleman: It's possible that there was one hemorrhage on the twentieth hospital day. As I looked at these adrenal glands grossly some of the hemorrhage seemed a little older, and there may have been more recent hemorrhage continuing in attacks. Of course, we can't prove this.Dr. Swartz: In our experience, the patients with acute, fulminant meningococcemia who subsequently died as a result of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage usually did not have this degree of hyponatremia.\n",

      "question": "A 38-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of a pulmonary infiltrate.\nShe was well until eight years earlier, when bloody diarrhea occurred and a diagnosis of ulcerative proctitis was made. Sulfasalazine was prescribed; after a course of seven weeks the Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome developed, accompanied by a dry cough and dyspnea. Prednisone was given, with recovery. Asthma developed subsequently. Seven and a half years before admission a barium-enema examination showed a slight decrease in haustral markings in the distal transverse and descending colon, with a suggestion of mucosal thickening in the splenic flexure; no ulcers were observed. X-ray films of the chest revealed slight hyperinflation of the lungs, with flattening of the diaphragm. Two months later, during an episode of wheezing, an x-ray film of the chest disclosed interstitial densities throughout both lower lung fields.\nDuring the next few years the patient was admitted to another hospital on six occasions because of asthmatic attacks, during two of which tracheal intubation was performed. Multiple medications were prescribed, including adrenocorticosteroids. Three and a half years before entry x-ray films of the chest disclosed a slight increase in lung markings; the interstitial densities were improved in comparison with the previous study. A repeated barium-enema examination showed ulcers in the rectosigmoid and descending colon; the proximal transverse colon and ascending colon appeared normal. Eleven months before entry, during a bout of increased wheezing, an x-ray film of the chest disclosed an increase in the interstitial markings, particularly in the lower lobes; the fissures were thickened, and there was minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus. Seven months before admission a nasal polypectomy was performed at another hospital. The white-cell count was 10,600, with 19 per cent eosinophils. An x-ray film of the chest was normal.\nThree weeks before entry the patient began to have a persistent cough that was productive of clear sputum. Despite a 10-day course of erythromycin the cough increased, and a low-grade fever developed, with nightly sweats. On the day of admission an x-ray film of the chest (\nFig. 1\n) showed a diffuse reticulonodular infiltrate throughout both lungs, most marked in the lower lobes; minimal hilar lymphadenopathy was seen.\nThe patient was an elementary-school teacher and had worked previously as a counselor in camps in Maine and New Hampshire. There was a remote history of urticaria after the ingestion of aspirin. Nasal polypectomies had been performed on four occasions. She had smoked one package of cigarettes daily for 10 years but stopped eight years before entry. There was a family history of mild asthma in her father and of nasal polyps in her mother. There had been no exposure to animals, industrial dusts, or tuberculosis, recent travel outside New England, hemoptysis, or rash; her usual wheeze had not increased recently.\nThe temperature was 38.5\u00b0C, the pulse 120, and the respirations 24. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient was dyspneic at rest. Multiple small wheals were observed on the left wrist and thigh; a tender, erythematous area, 3 cm in diameter, was present on the dorsum of the left foot. There was no peripheral edema, clubbing, or cyanosis. Cataracts were observed in both eyes. Shotty lymph-node enlargement was found in both inguinal regions and the left femoral triangle. Examination of the lungs disclosed expiratory prolongation, with wheezes and rhonchi; no rales were heard. Abdominal, pelvic, rectal, and neurologic examinations were negative.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 41.1 per cent; the white-cell count was 21,300, with 28 percent neutrophils, 2 per cent band forms, 10 per cent lymphocytes, 2 per cent monocytes, and 58 per cent eosinophils. The total eosinophil count was 11,387, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 17 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 11 mg per 100 ml (3.9 mmol per liter), the glucose 83 mg per 100 ml (4.6 mmol per liter), the calcium 9.5 mg per 100 ml (2.4 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 4.1 mg per 100 ml (1.3 mmol per liter), the bilirubin 0.3 mg per 100 ml (5.1 \u03bcmol per liter), the uric acid 2.9 mg per 100 ml (0.2 mmol per liter), and the protein 7.4 g (the albumin 3.9 g, and the globulin 3.5 g) per 100 ml. The sodium was 137 mmol, the potassium 3.7 mmol, the chloride 103 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 26 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) was 15 U per milliliter (0.1 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 144 U per milliliter (2.4 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 33 mU per milliliter (0.6 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), and the alkaline phosphatase 23 IU (0.4 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter). A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing room air, disclosed that the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO\n2\n) was 55 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO\n2\n) 35 mm Hg, and the pH 7.49. Pulmonary-function studies were performed (\nTable 1\n). An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110 and an axis of +70\u00b0 and was normal. An echocardiogram revealed a small posterior pericardial effusion; the heart chambers were normal in size. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and heterophil antibodies were negative. Cytologic study of sputum was negative on two occasions. Agarose-gel electrophoresis of the serum gave a normal pattern. A quantitative serum immunoelectrophoresis disclosed that IgG was 1493 mg, IgA 250 mg, and IgM 298 mg per 100 ml. Microscopical examination of stained specimens of sputum was negative for acid-fast bacilli on two occasions. A culture of urine and two blood cultures were negative, and a culture of sputum yielded a normal throat flora. A tuberculin skin test (PPD, 5 TU) was negative, and a skin test with streptokinase-streptodornase was positive.\nAminophylline, terbutaline, betamethasone, and beclomethasone diproprionate were continued. The temperature fell to 37.7\u00b0C. On the third hospital day the patient was subjectively improved, although examination revealed no change. On the following day the lesion on the left foot was biopsied; microscopical examination revealed a recent thrombus within the lumen of a medium-sized subcutaneous vein, with neutrophilic infiltration and focal fibrinoid necrosis of the wall. A nonproductive cough continued to annoy the patient. An x-ray film of the chest was unchanged. On the fifth hospital day the white-cell count was 21,400, with 61 per cent eosinophils. On the seventh hospital day intermittent positive-pressure breathing with isoetharine was begun.\nOn the eighth hospital day leukapheresis was initiated. On the next day tests for precipitating antibodies to several thermophilic actinomycete antigens, pigeon antigens, and\nSitophilus granarium\nwere negative. Another x-ray film of the chest showed no change. On the 10th hospital day leukapheresis was interrupted because of the development of muscle cramps. Another electrocardiogram was unchanged.\nAn operation was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Gordon L. Snider\\*: This 38-year old woman had ulcerative proctocolitis, asthma, nasal polyposis, urticaria, a family history of atopy, peripheral-blood eosinophilia, and diffuse pulmonary parenchymal infiltration. The pulmonary-function tests revealed evidence of severe airways obstruction and increased total lung capacity and residual volume compatible with asthma. The resting arterial-blood gas studies showed hypoxemia with hypocapnia; both worsened with exercise, consistent with either asthma or diffuse parenchymal infiltration. With the patient breathing 100 per cent oxygen the arterial PO2 was lower than expected, only 390 mm Hg, indicating an absolute right-to-left shunt of 16.5 per cent. It is of interest that correction of the hypoxemia did not abolish the hypocapnia, indicating that ventilation was being driven excessively by some other mechanism. The single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity was only moderately reduced to 72 per cent of the predicted value. However, in the presence of airways obstruction the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity may overestimate the diffusion function of the lungs. In this case the steady-state diffusing capacity, with a value of 42 per cent of the predicted, is probably a more valid estimate of the patient's gas-transfer function. In summary, then, the patient had airways obstruction, without loss of lung volume, and hypoxemia with hypocapnia. A sizable right-to-left shunt and impaired diffusion function were at least part of the mechanism of the hypoxemia. May we review the radiologic studies now?Dr. Reginald E. Greene: Representative films from the second barium-enema examination demonstrate mucosal ulcers extending from the splenic flexure to the rectum. That finding is characteristic of ulcerative colitis.An x-ray film of the chest obtained about seven years before admission demonstrates multiple linear densities throughout the lower-lung zones. Some of them are peripheral thickened interstitial septa, whereas others extend radially toward the periphery. An x-ray film of the chest taken five days later shows normal lungs. A film obtained 11 months before admission reveals multiple linear densities in the basilar pulmonary parenchyma similar to but less marked than those seen on the earlier films. The films of the chest taken on admission to this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) show the linear densities associated with indistinct nodular densities in the lower lung zones. Well-formed septal lines, or Kerley B lines, are evident in the retrosternal portions of the lungs on the lateral film. The diaphragm has an irregular appearance as a result of apposition of the irregular nodular lesions in the lung bases. The fissures are thickened, suggestive of subpleural infiltration of the pulmonary parenchyma. The hilar structures are slightly larger than they were a few years previously, but it is questionable whether this finding reflects hilar lymphadenopathy or slight dilatation of the pulmonary vasculature, possibly related to a high cardiac-output state associated with fever. The examinations during the hospital course revealed no change.Dr. Snider: At the age of 30 years this patient, who had been well previously, had ulcerative proctitis, and when she was treated with sulfasalazine the Stevens-Johnson syndrome developed. A few weeks later x-ray films of the chest demonstrated a diffuse pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate, which subsided after the administration of corticosteroids. Soon thereafter fairly severe asthma occurred, requiring several admissions to the hospital. Eleven months before admission to this hospital diffuse pulmonary parenchymal infiltration was again demonstrated on x-ray films, and eosinophilia with a calculated count of up to about 2000 per cubic millimeter was documented.Slight eosinophilia often accompanies asthma, but whenever the count exceeds 1000 per cubic millimeter or is associated with pulmonary parenchymal infiltration the possibility of a complicating process must be considered. Among the causes of pulmonary eosinophilia and pulmonary parenchymal infiltration is bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, which is characterized by fever and a cough productive of brown plugs that contain eosinophils and often separate hyphae characteristic of aspergillus. The infiltrates are in the upper lung fields; they tend to be dense and are often wedge-shaped, being narrower at the hilus. Thus, they differ in appearance from the predominantly lower-lung-field, diffuse process that was seen in this case. The radiographic shadows of mucoid impaction of the bronchi are also dense and wedgeshaped, with a bunch-of-grapes or distended-glove appearance. Bronchocentric granulomatosis, which is a necrotizing granulomatous process involving small bronchi, produces shadows similar to those of mucoid impaction of the bronchi and may occur in patients with asthma. This process may be associated with eosinophilia, but it, too, tends to be in the upper lung fields.The blood eosinophilia accompanying ascariasis, strongyloidiasis, ankylostomiasis, or toxicara infestation may be associated with a diffuse pulmonary parenchymal infiltration, but recurrent and paroxysmal airways obstruction, which marked this patient's course, does not occur with these parasitic infestations. The clinical and radiographic features in this case are compatible with tropical eosinophilia, which is related to filarial infection. Patients with that disorder may have a fever and can have marked eosinophilia, often with a count as high as 60,000 eosinophils per cubic millimeter. A diffuse pulmonary parenchymal infiltration is usual. However, we have no history that this patient has been in the Far East, tropical Africa, or South America, where she might have acquired this disease.Eosinophilic pneumonia occurs in patients who have asthma or atopic disease, although the airways obstruction is often mild at the time of the parenchymal infiltration. Cough, weight loss, fever, and sometimes prostration characterize this syndrome.[1](#core-r001) In contrast to the radiologic picture in this case, however, the parenchymal infiltrates are dense and tend to be localized in the upper lung fields and in the periphery. The sparing of the central lung zones gives the appearance of a photographic negative image of pulmonary edema. Eosinophilic pneumonia is very responsive to corticosteroids.[2](#core-r002) In the case under discussion the lack of the appropriate roentgenographic picture and of a response to corticosteroid therapy makes this diagnosis unlikely.This patient had a 3-cm, raised, tender area on the dorsum of the left foot, and a biopsy revealed phlebitis with necrosis and a neutrophilic infiltration. There were also multiple wheals on the left wrist and thigh, which presumably represented transient urticaria.The clinical and radiographic features of this case strongly suggest systemic necrotizing vasculitis, a broad spectrum of disorders involving vessels of various sizes, types, and locations and characterized by different clinical manifestations. They may occur with or without identifiable precipitating factors. In a substantial number of cases necrotizing vasculitis is associated with or caused by immunopathologic mechanisms. The prevailing theory is that most vasculitic syndromes are caused by deposition of immune complexes in vessel walls. The probable antigen has been identified most clearly in hepatitis B antigen-associated vasculitis.[3](#core-r003) Optimally, the type of vasculitis should be classified according to its cause, but that is not possible at the present time. We must therefore depend on a classification based on a combination of the pathological and clinical features of the various forms, recognizing that overlaps occur among the various subtypes. Fauci et al.[4](#core-r004) have recently provided an up-to-date and very useful classification. I shall confine my discussion to the types that involve the lungs, which can be divided into four large groups \u2014 polyarteritis nodosa, hypersensitivity vasculitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis.Polyarteritis nodosa is further subclassified into the classic form, allergic angiitis with granulomatosis, and the \"overlap syndrome,\" which has features of the first two subgroups. Classic polyarteritis nodosa involves medium-sized muscular arteries and usually spares the spleen and the lungs, although the bronchial arteries may be involved. Allergic angiitis with granulomatosis is a systemic vasculitis, with pulmonary involvement virtually a sine qua non of the diagnosis. This disorder is associated with atopic disease, most often asthma, and more than 90 per cent of the patients have peripheral-blood eosinophilia, which is often marked, as in this case. Allergic angiitis with granulomatosis was described by Churg and Strauss[5](#core-r005) in 1951 as granulomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis involving the heart, lungs, skin, and nervous system. The roentgenograms of the chest may be normal or may show a variety of parenchymal infiltrates, which are usually diffuse but may be focal and may undergo necrosis. Some lesions may wax while others wane. Histologic examination of the lungs typically shows fibrinoid necrosis and granulomatous inflammation of the connective tissues, with eosinophil infiltration and frequently pulmonary arteritis. Almost all the patients have fever. The heart, particularly the epicardium, was the organ most often involved next to the lung in the series of Churg and Strauss,[5](#core-r005) and this frequency of cardiac involvement has been confirmed in subsequent reports.[6](#core-r006) Involvement of the epicardium is probably the explanation for the small posterior pericardial effusion that was detected on an echocardiogram in the case under discussion. Ten of the 13 patients studied by Churg and Strauss had skin lesions. Nonthrombocytopenic purpura was observed, but the most frequent lesion, occurring in seven of the patients, was a deep cutaneous or subcutaneous nodule on the head, trunk, or extremities. In their series examination of the skin lesions showed either vasculitis or a combination of vasculitis and granulomatous inflammation of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. In contrast to patients with classic polyarteritis nodosa, patients with so-called allergic angiitis with granulomatosis have considerable involvement of small blood vessels, as exemplified by the cutaneous vasculitis in this patient. This process is called allergic not because we know the immunopathologic mechanisms of the disease but because it occurs in patients with an allergic diathesis. I believe that the patient under discussion had this form of vasculitis.Hypersensitivity vasculitis encompasses a large, heterogeneous group of syndromes in which small-vessel involvement predominates. The lesions are believed to result from immune-complex deposition, with a drug or microorganism as the source of the antigen. Sulfonamides, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and hepatitis B antigen are examples of these two classes of agents. Endogenous antigens such as tumor antigens or serum proteins, as in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia or the types of vasculitis associated with the connective-tissue diseases, may also cause hypersensitivity vasculitis.[7](#core-r007) The skin is the most commonly affected organ, with the disorder manifested by palpable purpura due to leukocytoclastic vasculitis involving post-capillary venules. The kidneys, nerves, liver, heart, spleen, and lungs may also be affected. I wonder whether this patient had pulmonary parenchymal vasculitis 7 1/2 years before admission, at the time of the sulfasalazine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The dyspnea, dry cough, and linear densities demonstrated on the radiographs of the chest could have occurred on that basis.Eosinophilia is uncommon is association with Wegener's granulomatosis and lymphomatoid granulomatosis, and the clinical and roentgenographic features in this case do not fit either of these diseases. Wegener's granulomatosis, in particular, tends to cause bilateral dense, nodular infiltrates that are sometimes extensive. Necrosis is frequent, and the nodular shadows wax and wane. A diffuse parenchymal infiltrate, such as that seen in this patient, is unusual. In lymphomatoid granulomatosis the lesion is denser, there is usually more extensive pleural involvement than was demonstrated in this case, and the central nervous system is affected more frequently.[8](#core-r008) Finally, pulmonary vasculitis has been reported in a few patients with ulcerative colitis.[9\u201312](#core-r009) In some cases the vasculitis appeared to be associated with the administration of sulfasalazine used to treat the colitis. However, there is a report of one case of vasculitis that was not associated with such treatment; the systemic vasculitis subsided within two weeks after colectomy for a suspected carcinoma. I think that the ulcerative colitis in this case was unrelated to the vasculitis. The allergic diathesis and hypereosinophilia seem to be more important factors in the background.The combination of septal thickening and nodular densities in the lungs in this patient requires consideration of lymphangitic carcinomatosis. However, the marked eosinophilia and the cutaneous vasculitis make that possibility unlikely. Left ventricular failure, which may complicate systemic vasculitis, is a common cause of this radiographic appearance but can be excluded on clinical grounds. If allergic angiitis with granulomatosis proves to be the correct diagnosis in this case the septal thickening will probably prove to have resulted from granulomatous inflammation in the interlobular septa. With regard to the peripheral localization of the parenchymal process, it is interesting that experimentally induced pneumonia and fibrosis usually vary greatly in severity from area to area, even though the disease is widespread. For example, in lung injury produced experimentally by the intramuscular or intravenous administration of bleomycin the inflammatory response is often concentrated subpleurally. The explanation for the focal nature of interstitial lesions is not understood but may be related to regional variations in the flow of air and blood resulting from vasomotor and bronchomotor phenomena.Leukapheresis was tried in this case on the assumption that infiltration with eosinophils was the cause of tissue damage and that the inflammatory process might be relieved if the hypereosinophilic state could be corrected. There is limited evidence for this hypothesis, [13,14](#core-r013) and the therapy has to be regarded as experimental. Cyclophosphamide, either alone or in combination with previously administered corticosteroid therapy, is the treatment of choice for allergic angiitis with granulomatosis. I believe that an open-lung biopsy was the operation performed in this case to confirm the diagnosis in preparation for initiation of this form of treatment.Dr. William Franklin: Dr. Snider, do you think that vasculitis accounts for the asthma that developed about eight years previously?Dr. Snider: According to my experience, vasculitis is infrequent in association with asthma, and we have no indication of any other connective-tissue disorder, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Although the vasculitis associated with asthma is called allergic vasculitis, we have far less convincing data indicating that it is on an immunologic basis than we have for a number of other forms of vasculitis. I do not think that vasculitis accounts for the development of this patient's asthma.Dr. Elliott Alpert: I took care of the patient during the initial part of the course, when inflammatory bowel disease was a recurrent problem that required long-term steroid therapy. It finally went into remission, and we were able to discontinue systemic steroid therapy. Then the pulmonary symptoms began to appear more progressively.In a recent study of patients with inflammatory bowel disease Dr. Barry J. Kemler and I found elevation of circulating immune complexes in a substantial proportion of the patients with ulcerative colitis.[15](#core-r015) It is tempting to postulate that this patient, who had a background of marked allergy, had an abnormal immune response to some antigen related to inflammatory bowel disease, with more circulating complexes than many patients with inflammatory bowel disease have and an increased capacity of the complexes to deposit in tissues, causing vasculitis.Dr. Barry W. Levine: This patient's asthma was associated with nasal polyposis and sensitivity to both aspirin and indomethacin. In fact, when indomethacin had been given to her in the past status asthmaticus developed. The course of the asthma was not particularly atypical until she became acutely ill with this new disorder.Dr. Eugene J. Mark: Dr. Kosinski, what were the indications for the leukapheresis in this patient?Dr. Katherine S. Kosinski: We performed it with the hope that by lowering the total eosinophil count we might arrest further damage to pulmonary tissue. Although the treatment is experimental and has been reported to be of value in only one other case of hypereosinophilia, [13](#core-r013) we thought that the low morbidity of the procedure warranted an attempt. We collected a total of 5X1010 white cells with 60 per cent eosinophils, despite premature termination of the last procedure because of hypocalcemia.Dr. Levine: Our initial diagnosis was Wegener's granulomatosis or a Churg\u2013Strauss type of angiitis. We were also concerned about the possibility of lymphangitic spread of carcinoma because of the pleural changes. Despite the leukapheresis the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and we proceeded with a lung biopsy.Dr. Mark: Ms. Lieberman, will you present the medical students' diagnosis?Ms. Judith Lieberman: We thought that the disease belonged in the class of pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia and necrotizing vasculitis, but it did not fit readily into a diagnosis of either Churg\u2013Strauss allergic granulomatosis or periarteritis nodosa. We also thought that the illness might have been precipitated by the sulfasalazine therapy.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Mark: The operation was a limited thoracotomy through a 7-cm incision with a biopsy of the left lower lobe. The pleural surface appeared dull-yellow and thickened. The lung was firmer than normal. Histologic examination revealed massive edema of the pleura and interlobular septa, with an infiltrate of mature eosinophils ([Fig. 2](#f002) and [3](#f003)). The infiltrate extended through all the layers of the pleura, through the walls of veins in the septa, and to a lesser degree in the interstitium, around bronchovascular bundles, the bronchiolar mucosa, and the walls of small pulmonary arteries. The interalveolar septa were only slightly involved. The air spaces were devoid of cells, fluid, or organisms. No eosinophilic abscesses or Charcot-Leyden crystals were seen. Lymphocytes and plasma cells accounted for less than 5 per cent of the inflammatory cells. The interstitial collagen was not increased. The bronchiolar respiratory epithelium consisted principally of mucin-secreting goblet cells rather than the normal ciliated columnar cells, the basement membranes of the bronchioles were thickened, and the smooth muscle was hyperplastic ([Fig. 4](#f004)). This triad of findings is characteristic of chronic asthma.[16](#core-r016)Angiitis was present to the extent that eosinophilic leukocytes extensively infiltrated the intima, media, and adventitia of pulmonary arteries and veins. Eccentric intimal hyperplasia of some pulmonary arteries may have reflected thrombosis or scarring due to previous episodes of vascular inflammation ([Fig. 5](#f005)). Thickening of arterial walls can occur in patients with severe chronic asthma who have no interstitial inflammation or vasculitis.[17](#core-r017) Active destruction of vascular walls with nuclear dust, fibrinoid necrosis, and hemorrhage was not observed. Direct immunofluorescence of a frozen piece of the lung-biopsy specimen demonstrated deposition of complement, IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE in the eosinophils ([Fig. 6](#f006)), but the deposits were found nowhere else in the tissue. This finding, although nonspecific, suggests that the eosinophilic pneumonitis was not due to a primary necrotizing pulmonary vasculitis.The pathological findings are those of asthma with unusual facets. The absence of granulomas or foci of fibrinoid necrosis with histocytic palisades excludes a diagnosis of allergic granulomatosis. The histologic pattern is also not that of polyarteritis nodosa or Wegener's granulomatosis. Although the process was an eosinophilic pneumonitis in the broad sense of the term, the clinical, radiologic, and pathological features are all atypical of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.[1,2](#core-r001) The process was not particularly sensitive to corticosteroids, unlike chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. The presence of fever and weight loss and the absence of atopy and asthma before the development of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia serve to distinguish it from asthmatic pulmonary eosinophilia.[18](#core-r018) This patient's disease most closely approximates Harkavy's syndrome[19](#core-r019) of \"vascular allergy\" in asthmatic patients who have recurrent pulmonary infiltration and eosinophilic polyserositis. In Harkavy's series of nine cases, including one with postmortem examination, all the patients had severe asthma, sinusitis, marked blood eosinophilia, and recurrent interstitial pulmonary disease. Autopsy disclosed an interstitial eosinophilic infiltrate without granulomas. Pleuritis, pericarditis, and subcutaneous nodules due to vasculitis also occurred, as in this case, as well as urticaria, purpura, polyarthritis, myocarditis, and sterile peritonitis. I surmise that a biopsy of this patient's lung 7 1/2 years ago would have shown an identical histologic pattern. I shall not be surprised if vasculitis appears in other organs in the future.Dr. Snider: Infiltration of the pleura, interlobular septa, veins, and bronchi by eosinophils was the prime histologic feature in this case. However, the absence of localization of the infiltrate in the periphery of the lungs and the sparing of the alveolar spaces and interalveolar septa as well as the failure of the process to respond to corticosteroids make this case unlike most reported cases of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. Mild vasculitis affecting a few small vessels, mostly venules, was present in six of the nine cases of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia reported by Carrington et al.[1](#core-r001) The process consisted mostly of a perivascular cuff of lymphocytes and eosinophils; true necrosis of vessel walls was never observed. One of their patients also had subcutaneous nodules due to vasculitis. I wonder if the case under discussion today represents an extreme end of the spectrum of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, with localization of the eosinophilic infiltrate to pleural interlobular septa and perivascular and peribronchial regions and decreased responsiveness to corticosteroids. It would be helpful to know how much corticosteroid therapy the patient had received in the past and how she responded to it. I assume that an additional course of corticosteroids was administered before a trial of immunosuppressive therapy was undertaken.Dr. Levine: Initially, the patient had a rapidly downhill course and came very close to requiring intubation. At that time she was receiving 80 mg of methylprednisolone per day administered intravenously. The total eosinophil count was still approximately 2000 per cubic millimeter. An increase in the methylprednisolone to 200 mg per day produced a rapid fall in the eosinophil count and improvement in both the appearance on the x-ray films of the chest and the gas exchange. However, she had received steroid therapy intermittently for many years and had severe bilateral cataracts. Because of her dread of further steroid therapy and the presence of cataracts it was decided to decrease the dose very rapidly to 40 mg per day over a period of two weeks. The eosinophilia remained in the range of 600 per cubic millimeter. At that time chlorambucil, 4 mg per day, was started, and the steroids were decreased further. After two months she is now on a dose of 5 mg of prednisone per day, the total eosinophil count is 220, and the white-cell count is 9000. She is still receiving a course of chlorambucil, 4 mg per day, and is much improved and free of asthma or any other evidence of vasculitis.\n",

      "question": "A 41-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of a question of meningoencephalitis.\nThe patient was well until nine days earlier, in late May, when a severe, diffuse headache occurred, followed by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and subsequent diarrhea. The temperature rose to 39.4\u00b0C, then fell to normal, and rose again over the next few days.\nTwo days before admission the patient entered another hospital, where physical examination showed that the temperature was 39.1\u00b0C and the blood pressure 170/110 mm Hg. The patient was acutely ill, mildly dehydrated, and confused. A few scattered petechiae were observed over the arms and legs, and mild nuchal rigidity was noted. A blood count and the urea nitrogen and electrolytes were reported to be normal; the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) was moderately elevated; the serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) were minimally increased. A lumbar puncture yielded slightly xanthochromic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that contained 76 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 90 percent were lymphocytes, 5 percent monocytes, and 5 percent neutrophils; the glucose was 2.3 mmol per liter (42 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 2.41 g per liter (241 mg per 100 ml). An x-ray film of the chest was normal. A cranial computed tomographic (CT) scan was reported to be negative, and an electroencephalogram was said to be diffusely abnormal. Ampicillin was given by vein. Fever persisted, and delirium developed; the hypertension worsened and diminished after the sublingual administration of nifedipine. A test for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative. Because of a history of genital herpes infection with a questionable recent recurrence, acyclovir was begun by vein. The patient was transferred to this hospital; all bacteriologic cultures remained sterile at the time of transfer.\nThe patient was a furniture salesman. His wife was well; a daughter, nine weeks old, was receiving treatment for bronchiolitis. There was a history of borderline hypertension and urolithiasis. The patient had picnicked in a wooded area near Boston a few days before the onset of symptoms, without being aware of having been bitten by a tick or a mosquito. There was a family history of diabetes mellitus in the patient's father. There was no history of exposure to communicable diseases or to animals, travel outside Massachusetts, recent dental procedures, receipt of transfusions or vaccines, homosexual activity, intravenous drug abuse, or allergy.\nThe temperature was 38.7\u00b0C, the pulse was 128, and the respirations were 24. The blood pressure was 210/130 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared acutely ill, agitated, and tremulous. No rash or lymphadenopathy was found except for a few shotty cervical lymph nodes. The head was normal. There was moderate nuchal rigidity; no bruits were heard. The lungs were clear, and the heart sounds were normal. Abdominal examination was negative; the liver and spleen were not felt. There was no peripheral edema, cyanosis, or digital clubbing. The genitalia were normal; no herpetic lesions were seen. On neurologic examination the patient was alert and oriented except for uncertainty about the date; his speech was fluent, although his concentration was poor and he occasionally perseverated. Bilateral papilledema was present, and a small round hemorrhage was seen adjacent to the right optic disk. The cranial-nerve functions were intact. Strength, muscle bulk, and tone were intact in the limbs, although movements were slow. Sensory function was preserved. The tendon reflexes were ++ and symmetric; the plantar responses were flexor.\nThe urine gave a + test for protein, a + + + + test for glucose, and a + test for ketones; the sediment was normal. The hematocrit was 47.2 percent; the white-cell count was 7900, with 86 percent neutrophils, 6 percent lymphocytes, and 8 percent monocytes on an automated differential count that is insensitive to eosinophils. The platelet count was 229,000, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 23 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 5.0 mmol per liter (14 mg per 100 ml), the creatinine 110 \u03bcmol per liter (1.2 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 14.8 mmol per liter (267 mg per 100 ml), the uric acid 0.28 mmol per liter (4.7 mg per 100 ml), the conjugated bilirubin 10 \u03bcmol per liter (0.6 mg per 100 ml), the total bilirubin 29 \u03bcmol per liter (1.7 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 2.3 mmol per liter (9.6 mg per 100 ml), the phosphorus 0.97 mmol per liter (3.0 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 77 g (the albumin 41 g and the globulin 36 g) per liter (7.7 g [4.1 g and 3.6 g] per 100 ml). The sodium was 134 mmol, the potassium 2.7 mmol, the magnesium 1.6 mmol, the chloride 96 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 26 mmol per liter. The ASAT was 27 U (new normal for a man, 10 to 40), the LDH 467 U (new normal, 110 to 210), the creatine kinase (CK) 132 U (new normal for a man, 60 to 400), and the alkaline phosphatase 48 U per liter (new normal for a man, 45 to 115). An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 140, with minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. A cranial CT scan, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of intracerebral or extracerebral hemorrhage; no areas of abnormally low attenuation were seen within the temporal lobes; the ventricles were normal in size and position; the cerebral sulci appeared prominent; no evidence of a mass effect was identified. A lumbar puncture yielded hazy, slightly xanthochromic CSF under an initial pressure of 330 mm; the fluid contained 24 red cells and 132 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 93 percent were lymphocytes, 2 percent neutrophils, 4 percent monocytes, and 1 percent nonhematic cells; the glucose was 4.9 mmol per liter (89 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 2.64 g per liter (264 mg per 100 ml); microscopical examination of stained specimens of the fluid disclosed no fungi, acid-fast bacilli, or other micro-organisms; a test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen and a serologic test for syphilis were negative; cytologic examination of the fluid revealed no malignant-tumor cells; a culture yielded no micro-organisms.\nSpecimens of blood, urine, and CSF were obtained for culture. Acyclovir was continued by vein, and potassium chloride was administered. Nifedipine was given sublingually, and the blood pressure fell to 150/80 mm Hg. A repeated physical examination later in the day showed generalized weakness that was most marked in the lower extremities.\nAt 2 a.m. on the second hospital day the patient reported bilateral leg weakness. Examination revealed that he was able to move his toes but could not lift either leg from the bed; strength in the arms was unimpaired. The right pupil was 3 mm, and the left pupil 4.5 mm; both pupils constricted to 2 mm in response to light. A right ptosis was present, with intact extra-ocular movements; the corneal reflexes and facial sensation were preserved; the face was symmetric, the gag reflex was active, and the tongue was midline. No sensory level was found. The tendon reflexes were + + + and equal, and the plantar responses were flexor. Anal sphincter tone was preserved. Respirations were irregular, with 10-second to 15-second periods of apnea interspersed with rapid breathing. Mannitol and dexamethasone were administered. The blood pressure rose to 185/120 mm Hg, and additional doses of nifedipine were given sublingually. A repeated cranial CT scan, performed before and after the intravenous administration of contrast material, again disclosed no evidence of intracranial bleeding; no filling defects were identified within the superior sagittal sinus, and no evidence of a contrast-enhancing mass lesion or abnormality within the temporal lobes was observed. When the patient was returned to the floor from the CT scanner at 4:15 a.m. he was disoriented to place but could still obey commands. During the next few hours his state of awareness and responsiveness declined. By 9 a.m. he no longer obeyed commands and responded only to noxious stimuli. His respirations were shallow; the blood pressure fell to the range of 70 to 100 mm Hg systolic, and acrocyanosis was noted. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing room air, showed that the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO\n2\n) was 54 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO\n2\n) 74 mm Hg, and the pH 7.26. Dopamine and electrolyte solutions were administered by vein. A left nasotracheal tube was inserted, and ventilatory assistance was begun; a nasogastric tube was passed. An x-ray film of the chest revealed that the lungs were clear, and the cardiomediastinal silhouette appeared normal; the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes terminated in appropriate positions; mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm was noted. The patient was transferred to the Neurologic Intensive Care Unit. A right frontal Camino bolt was inserted under local anesthesia; the intracranial pressure was 6 cm of water. Nafcillin and phenytoin were begun by vein; an indwelling catheter was inserted into the bladder. The hematocrit was 41.8 percent; the white-cell count was 10,500, with 85 percent neutrophils; the platelet count was 247,000. The urea nitrogen was 7.5 mmol per liter (21 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 11.3 mmol per liter (204 mg per 100 ml), the conjugated bilirubin 2 \u03bcmol per liter (0.1 mg per 100 ml), the total bilirubin 15 \u03bcmol per liter (0.9 mg per 100 ml), the uric acid 0.33 mmol per liter (5.6 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 2.0 mmol per liter (8.0 mg per 100 ml), the phosphorus 0.68 mmol per liter (2.1 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 56 g (the albumin and globulin each 28 g) per liter (5.6 g [2.8 g and 2.8 g] per 100 ml). The sodium was 143 mmol, the potassium 3.8 mmol, the chloride 106 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 23 mmol per liter; the osmolality was 302 mOsm per liter. The ASAT was 20 U, the LDH 367 U, the CK 77 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 32 U per liter. The ammonia was 42 \u03bcmol per liter (normal, 12 to 55). Another specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was being ventilated with 100 percent oxygen, revealed that the PaO\n2\nwas 77 mm Hg, the PaCO\n2\n27 mm Hg, and the pH 7.56. A test for heterophil agglutinins was negative. An electroencephalogram demonstrated anterior slowing and no alpha activity; the left hemisphere had widespread 8-Hz activity at low amplitude, which was not present on the right side; no epileptiform activity was seen. A radionuclide ventilation\u2014perfusion scan, performed after the inhalation of\n131\nXe and the intravenous injection of\n99m\nTc macroaggregated albumin, disclosed evidence of ventilation of only the upper lobes; there was perfusion of the upper and lower lobes, with a subsegmental defect in the lateral basal segment of the left lower lobe; a high right hemidiaphragmatic leaf was again seen. Noninvasive studies of the lower extremities gave no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. Later in the day examination showed that the temperature was 38.5\u00b0C, the pulse 98, and the blood pressure 120/50 mm Hg. The patient was unresponsive to voice or painful stimuli. The lungs and heart remained normal. The abdomen was slightly distended, with normal bowel sounds. No peripheral edema or digital clubbing was seen. The eyes were closed but opened in response to tactile stimuli and on flexion of the neck; the eyes were divergent and deviated upward, with occasional roving to either side and a few saccades to right and left; no nystagmus was noted; the optic fundi could not be seen. The corneal reflexes were absent; twitching of the face was noted. The sucking reflex was positive, and the patient bit a tongue depressor; the gag reflex was questionable. The right pupil was 2.5 mm and the left 3 mm; both pupils failed to react to light but dilated in response to noxious stimuli applied to the thorax. The arms and legs were flaccid and immobile; the tendon reflexes were ++ and equal; the plantar responses were unreactive. Additional specimens of blood were obtained for culture.\nOn the third hospital day the patient continued to require dopamine for maintenance of an adequate blood pressure. The temperature rose to 38.1\u00b0C. He remained obtunded; he opened his eyes to verbal commands but did not move his extremities in response to command or to painful stimuli. The eyes were deviated upward, with intermittent roving. The pupils were 2 mm, round, and unreactive to light. Right facial twitching was noted. The hematocrit was 39.7 percent; the white-cell count was 8900, with 86 percent neutrophils. The platelet count was 240,000, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 50 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 8.2 mmol per liter (23 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 13.5 mmol per liter (244 mg per 100 ml), the bilirubin 9 \u03bcmol per liter (0.5 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 57 g (the albumin 25 and the globulin 32 g) per liter (5.7 g [2.5 g and 3.2 g] per 100 ml). The sodium was 148 mmol, the potassium 3.9 mmol, the chloride 108 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 27 mmol per liter. The phenytoin level was 10.3 \u03bcg per milliliter. An electrocardiogram revealed a normal rhythm at a rate of 77, with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Another x-ray film of the chest was unchanged. An x-ray film of the abdomen disclosed gas throughout the colon, with little if any small-bowel gas and no evidence of distention of the small bowel. All bacteriologic cultures remained sterile. Another lumbar puncture yielded hazy, slightly xanthochromic CSF under an initial pressure of 250 mm; the fluid contained 720 red cells and 478 white cells, of which 10 percent were neutrophils, 1 percent eosinophils, 61 percent lymphocytes, 11 percent monocytes, and 17 percent nonhematic cells; the glucose was 3.5 mmol per liter (63 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 182 mg per 100 ml; microscopical examination of stained specimens of the fluid again revealed no fungi, acid-fast bacilli, or microorganisms, and a culture was sterile.\nOn the fourth hospital day the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C per rectum. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg after the withdrawal of dopamine. The patient opened his eyes to tactile stimulation and occasionally to voice but did not move his arms or legs. The eyes were divergent, with vertical movements and no nystagmus; the pupils were 2 mm and were unreactive to light. No tendon reflexes or plantar responses were elicited; muscle tone was flaccid. The hematocrit was 38.5 percent; the white-cell count was 6500, with 81 percent neutrophils. The urea nitrogen was 8.9 mmol per liter (25 mg per 100 ml), and the creatinine 70 \u03bcmol per liter (0.8 mg per 100 ml). A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was being ventilated with 50 percent oxygen, showed that the PaO\n2\nwas 73 mm Hg, the PaCO\n2\n44 mm Hg, and the pH 7.40. A test for cold agglutinins was negative. The Camino bolt was removed. Another cranial CT scan, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed a small amount of extra-cerebral fluid at the right frontal craniotomy site; there was no change in the prominence of the sulci; no evidence of hemorrhage was detected; an endotracheal and a nasogastric tube were in position, and opacification of the ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses was seen bilaterally. That evening the blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg systolic, with a pulse rate of 70. The rate of administration of fluids by vein was increased and dopamine was resumed, and the blood pressure rose to 155/75 mm Hg; the core temperature was 35\u00b0C. Gentamicin was begun by vein, and nafcillin was discontinued. Transient bouts of sinus bradycardia with a rate as low as 40 were noted.\nOn the fifth hospital day the temperature rose to 38.1\u00b0C after the application of a heating blanket. The lungs were clear, and neurologic examination showed no change. The urine gave a + + test for glucose; the sediment contained 8 red cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 39.3 percent; the white-cell count was 8600, with 88 percent neutrophils; the platelet count was 259,000. The prothrombin time was 9.4 seconds, with a control of 10.7 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 25.3 seconds. The bilirubin was 14 \u03bcmol per liter (0.8 mg per 100 ml). The ASAT was 26 U, the amylase 84 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 63 U per liter. All bacteriologic cultures performed at the referring hospital were reported to be negative. Another x-ray film of the chest showed that the lung volumes were low; no evidence of pneumonia was seen. A repeated x-ray film of the abdomen revealed minimal dilatation of loops of colon that were filled with gas; no dilatation of the small bowel or the cecum was shown; no evidence of free air was detected in a left lateral decubitus view. Electroencephalographic monitoring was begun and demonstrated no essential change in comparison with the study performed on the second hospital day. Additional doses of phenytoin were given, together with phenobarbital; hypotension recurred, and phenytoin was discontinued. On the following day repetitive spike activity was present over the left hemisphere at irregular intervals of one to three seconds; this activity was unaffected by the intravenous administration of various anticonvulsant medications and was unchanged during the next three days.\nOn the seventh hospital day the patient was in a profound coma and remained so during the remainder of his hospital stay. Intervals of unstable blood pressure recurred but were finally controlled without the administration of vasopressor medications. An ultrasonographic examination of both lower extremities revealed evidence of thrombosis of the right common femoral vein and was otherwise negative. Heparin was begun. On the eighth hospital day another cranial CT scan revealed opacification of the maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses; no evidence of a mass effect or intracerebral hemorrhage was detected; there was a small amount of subdural fluid in relation to the previous craniotomy site. On the following day instillation of 50 ml of ice water into the left external auditory canal elicited no movements of the eyes; a combination of ice-water stimulation and passive head movement resulted in slight upward and downward movements but no lateral eye movements. A tracheostomy was performed on the 10th hospital day, and the nasotracheal tube was removed. A repeated cranial CT scan, performed on the 14th hospital day, was unchanged. On the 16th hospital day another electroencephalogram again disclosed spike-wave activity over the left hemisphere. On the 21st hospital day a repeated electroencephalogram revealed anterior slowing and 10-second runs of bifrontal sharp waves at one per second, without clinical accompaniments; left hemispheric sharp waves were also present at irregular intervals. Pneumonia developed in the right upper lobe and was treated with antibiotics. Tests of adrenocortical and thyroid function gave normal results. A serologic test for Lyme disease was negative. A repeated test for antibodies to HIV was negative, as were tests for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody, antinuclear antibodies, and equine encephalitis virus. A culture of the buffy coat for cytomegalovirus (CMV) was negative. A viral culture of the CSF yielded no herpes simplex virus. The pupils were unequal and fixed, although they were not dilated. Thrombocytopenia developed and resolved after discontinuation of heparin. Frank diabetes mellitus occurred, in the absence of continued doses of adrenocorticosteroid medication, and was treated with insulin. Intermittent twitching of the face continued, sometimes on one side or the other and rarely bilaterally. The patient was areflexic to all stimuli, including ice-water caloric tests. Attempts at enterai feeding were discontinued because the volume of the aspirate repeatedly exceeded that of the input; central alimentation was begun. A status of \"do not resuscitate\" was ordered after consultation with the patient's wife. On the 41st hospital day the urea nitrogen was 24 mmol per liter (67 mg per 100 ml), the creatinine 130 \u03bcmol per liter (1.5 mg per 100 ml), the glucose 19.9 mmol per liter (358 mg per 100 ml), the calcium 2.3 mmol per liter (9.4 mg per 100 ml), the phosphorus 1.9 mmol per liter (5.8 mg per 100 ml), and the protein 61 g (the albumin 15 g and the globulin 46 g) per liter (6.1 g [1.5 g and 4.6 g] per 100 ml). Oliguria ensued, with hypotension and a low-grade fever.\nOn the 52nd hospital day the patient died.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. David A. Hafler\\*: This previously healthy 41-year-old man presented with symptoms of a viral prodrome consisting of fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He appeared to recover as defervescence occurred, and then days later a rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal multifocal inflammatory central nervous system disease developed. The neurologic manifestations were delirium associated with symptoms of meningismus and increased intracranial pressure with systemic hypertension, followed 48 hours later by weakness in the lower extremities associated with brisk reflexes but bilateral flexor plantar responses. His condition rapidly progressed to a state of stupor, which was preceded by upward deviation of the eyes, Horner's syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respirations. Over the next 48 hours the patient became areflexic and flaccid, indicating involvement of the spinal cord, and by the seventh hospital day he went into a coma, in which he remained until his death some weeks later. These diffuse central nervous system lesions were accompanied by a persistent, predominantly lymphocytic pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, with slight hemorrhage and an elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein level and a normal to slightly low glucose level.Inflammation in the nervous system can result from a primary central nervous system insult with the immune system responding to damaged tissue, as seen in viral infection and with tumors, or from a primary immunologic process with the immune system directly attacking normal tissue, an example of which is multiple sclerosis. In my discussion I shall consider disorders that fall into each of these categories.In approaching the diagnosis of neurologic disease I find it helpful to localize the lesions while considering the pathologic mechanisms that could underlie them. Although we are not told whether this patient's initial symptoms, which suggested an enteroviral infection, subsided, his fever abated before rising again. The interval between this viral prodrome and the subsequent neurologic disease may be important and will be discussed later. When he was admitted to the referring hospital the slight nuchal rigidity and confusion led to a lumbar puncture, which confirmed the diagnosis of an inflammatory lymphocytic process in the central nervous system.At this point the findings on examination were essentially nonfocal, and the delirium was consistent with a diffuse cortical lesion, as is seen with either meningitis or encephalitis. A major feature of the analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid was the presence of a relatively normal glucose level despite the presence of a large number of lymphocytes and a high level of protein, suggesting an aseptic meningitis.[1](#core-r001) The clinical differentiation of the various causes of an aseptic meningitis is difficult, since the laboratory examinations, including culture and antibody titers, are often unrevealing. Viruses can be difficult to isolate by culture, and evaluation of antibody titers generally requires a sample taken during convalescence; also, the level may be elevated as a result of previous exposure to the infectious agent. In this regard DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction, which can be very sensitive in the detection of viruses in human tissue, may be useful in the rapid and specific diagnosis of viral disease in the central nervous system.[2](#core-r002)Several infections can present with the clinical findings observed early in this patient's course. The picornaviruses, which include coxsackievirus, echovirus, and poliovirus, are the most common causes of viral meningitis and can result in the symptoms of an enterovirus infection with which the patient presented. Lower-motor weakness, which occurred later, can be seen with echovirus and coxsackievirus infection, although it is usually more transient and mild than that produced by poliovirus infection. Infection due to paramyxoviruses can also present as an aseptic meningitis.[1](#core-r001) We are not told of a previous illness or of vaccination against mumps and measles, and there were no skin manifestations of these diseases or of varicella infection. Although it is possible for a mumps meningoencephalitis to be present without other manifestations of mumps, that occurrence appears unlikely. Postviral encephalomyelitis, which I shall discuss later, is more frequently associated with paramyxoviral infections. Other viral diseases that can cause meningitis include those due to the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, adenoviruses, arboviruses, and the Epstein\u2013Barr virus, all of which would have been initially difficult to exclude in this case. The physicians caring for this man may have been concerned about treatable infections, such as those due to leptospira or borrelia, and they began ampicillin therapy. The patient was in a wooded area near Boston a few days before the onset of symptoms and had a biphasic clinical course consistent with leptospirosis, with chills, fever, headache, confusion, and subsequent meningismus. However, he did not have other symptoms of this disease, such as conjunctival suffusion and pulmonary infiltrates. Lyme disease is another increasingly common cause of aseptic meningitis, and the patient may be unaware of a bite by a tick that carried the spirochete. This diagnosis also appears improbable because of the absence of a rash and other characteristic symptoms and a subsequent negative serologic test for Lyme disease.[3](#core-r003)The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and he was transferred to a tertiary-care facility. On examination he was found to have papilledema and an increased intracranial pressure, which was subsequently confirmed on lumbar puncture, with an opening pressure of 330 mm. A repeated cranial CT scan was performed. Dr. Young, may we review the radiologic studies?Dr. Tina Young: The CT scan performed with and without the intravenous administration of contrast material on the second hospital day demonstrates no abnormal areas of enhancement. The ventricles are normal in size, with no mass effect and no midline shift. An x-ray film of the chest obtained on the same day shows clear lungs, without evidence of any abnormality. A CT scan that was obtained shortly after the craniotomy reveals a small amount of adjacent extracerebral fluid and some opacification of the sinuses but no focal abnormalities within the brain. A scan done on the 14th hospital day is unchanged.Dr. Hafler: Other possibilities to be considered are diseases in an immunosuppressed host with HIV infection, such as toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and primary central nervous system lymphoma. This patient did not appear to have any risk factors for HIV infection, and subsequently tests for antibodies to HIV were negative. Moreover, the CT scan was negative for ring-enhancing lesions as seen with toxoplasmosis, low-density white-matter lesions as seen with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or mass lesions as seen with central nervous system lymphoma, making these diagnoses unlikely.[4](#core-r004)The lack of evidence of temporal-lobe lesions in the cranial CT scan is important at this juncture because of the concern for herpes simplex encephalitis, the most common and treatable form of encephalitis. The CT scan is helpful diagnostically in approximately half the cases, showing low-density lesions in the frontal and temporal lobes, with scattered areas of hemorrhage. Johnson[5](#core-r005) stated in his monograph on viral infections of the nervous system that 90 percent of the patients have signs that suggest a focal temporal-lobe lesion. The cerebrospinal fluid is typically hemorrhagic, often with thousands of red cells per cubic millimeter, and the electroencephalogram in many cases reveals two-to-three-per-second high sharp waves in the temporal region. We are told of a history of genital herpes infection with a questionable recent recurrence, and acyclovir was administered by vein. Although Type 2 herpes simplex virus can cause encephalitis in the neonate as a result of genital herpetic infection in the mother, an association of encephalitis with genital herpes infection is very uncommon in adults and is unlikely to have occurred in this man. Nevertheless, a herpes simplex Type 1 infection of the brain that was associated with hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid and increased intracranial pressure and was unresponsive to acyclovir cannot be excluded but is improbable without a focal lesion.In regard to all the aforementioned causes of aseptic meningitis, the subsequent evolution of diffuse neurologic disease and an apparent viral prodrome in this patient make the diagnosis of a direct central nervous system viral infection unlikely.By the second hospital day Horner's syndrome and leg weakness had developed, with progression in two days to a flaccid, areflexic paraplegia. A few hours after the onset of leg weakness there was an even further decline in the patient's mental status. His eyes were closed, but opened in response to tactile stimulation and were found to be divergent and deviated upward, with occasional roving. The sucking reflex was positive, and both pupillary and corneal reflexes were absent. Thus, there was evidence of midbrain lesions both in the pretectal area, interrupting the pupillary reflex with sparing of the ciliospinal reflex, and bilaterally in the rostral interstitial nuclei of the medio-longitudinal fasciculus near the red nuclei, causing upward deviation of the eyes and loss of horizontal eye movements. These lesions were accompanied by loss of corneal reflexes and together were consistent with a lower-midbrain, pontine lesion, which could account for the decreased level of consciousness by interruption of the periaqueductal gray matter. A lesion or lesions in the sympathetic tracts, as manifested by the Homer's syndrome, may also explain the autonomic instability, with hypertension and arrhythmias. Alternatively, the unilateral Horner's syndrome, which was present on the second hospital day, may have represented an incipient transtentorial herniation with subsequent progression of the herniation syndrome to involve the midbrain, although the normal appearance of the CT scan is against the presence of central herniation. The areflexia associated with flaccid weakness and lack of plantar responses in the presence of the intraparenchymal lesions indicates a multilevel spinal-cord lesion that may or may not have been affecting the dorsal roots. The absence of a pupillary light reflex and corneal reflex and the presence of a Horner's syndrome might otherwise have been due to multiple cranial-nerve and spinal lesions with a bilateral optic neuritis, but that explanation appears unlikely. The presence of an optic neuritis would have been very useful in suggesting some form of multifocal demyelination.The localization of the patient's neurologic lesions suggests a number of pathologic processes that may also cause central nervous system inflammation. The first is carcinomatous or lymphomatous meningitis with neoplastic invasion of the spinal and cranial nerve roots. This disorder is usually associated with a low glucose level, a high protein level, and a slight pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid. The multiple negative examinations for malignant-tumor cells in the cerebrospinal fluid make this diagnosis much less likely, particularly in an otherwise healthy man with no known malignant tumor.[6](#core-r006) Other infections that can cause diffuse central nervous system involvement include tuberculous meningitis, which is improbable because of the lack of evidence of systemic tuberculosis, the negative cerebrospinal fluid cultures, and the rapid progression to coma[7](#core-r007); cryptococcosis, which is also improbable for similar reasons besides the very infrequent finding of papilledema with cryptococcal infections; and *Coccidioides immitis* infection, which is usually associated with a substantially lower glucose level and more neutrophils in the cerebrospinal fluid. Another type of infection that can cause the very malignant neurologic picture observed in this case is infection by amebae, such as naegleria. Amebic encephalitis is usually more focal in its neurologic presentation, and the cerebrospinal fluid generally contains more neutrophils. In addition, there is no history of swimming in fresh water for substantial periods.[8](#core-r008)Another major category of disorders that can affect the central nervous system is vascular disease, which can be divided into large-vessel and small-vessel diseases. Subacute bacterial endocarditis is a large-vessel disease that can be associated with fever and multiple central nervous system lesions. In addition to the negative bacterial cultures the diffuse involvement of the brain and spinal cord, the negative CT scans, and the antecedent fever, from which the patient recovered, argue strongly against this disease. The types of systemic vasculitis include polyarteritis nodosa, cranial (temporal) arteritis, and the vasculitis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The sedimentation rate of 23 mm per hour and the absence of any systemic involvement except for mild proteinuria make these diagnoses unlikely, although we are not given the results of a test for antinuclear antibodies.[9](#core-r009)Granulomatous angiitis is a primary central nervous system vasculitis that typically occurs in older persons and involves the small leptomeningeal arteries, less than 500 \u03bcm in diameter. The course of this disease varies, with the length of survival ranging from a few days to years.[10](#core-r010) The cerebrospinal fluid profile is also one of a lymphocytic pleocytosis, an elevated protein level, and a normal glucose level. Granulomatous angiitis is often diagnosed clinically by angiographic examination, which was not performed in this case. However, the antecedent viral syndrome and the severe multifocal nature of the disease with involvement of the spinal cord make this diagnosis improbable.Another rare disease involving small vessels in the central nervous system has recently been characterized as an angiotropic (intravascular) large-cell lymphoma.[11](#core-r011) Although this disease usually presents with a course more chronic than that in this case, with an average duration of 11 months, angiotropic lymphoma is accompanied by dementia, focal neurologic signs in the brain and particularly in the spinal cord and dorsal-nerve roots, a high cerebrospinal fluid protein level, and fever.[12](#core-r012) In most reported cases of angiotropic lymphoma there have been no cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, in contrast to this case. Angiotropic lymphoma frequently involves the small vessels of the liver, adrenal gland, kidney, skin, lung, pancreas, and heart, which could explain the elevated LDH level with normal ALAT and ASAT levels, the elevated glucose level, and the assumed pulmonary embolism that occurred in this case. Recent studies have indicated that these neoplastic cells express T-cell\u2013specific cell-surface markers, including CD4, CD2, and CD8, which are commonly observed in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Moreover, these lymphoma cells have been shown to express high levels of CD45, the leukocyte common antigen. Thus, it has been postulated that this disease represents an intravascular lymphoma with the lymphocytes migrating to the endothelial spaces.[11](#core-r011)The next major category of central nervous system diseases that I shall consider includes acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis. I shall discuss them in the context of primary immune dysregulation, wherein T cells directly invade the nervous system, recognizing and causing damage in normal tissue, characteristic of autoimmune disease. The classic model of primary immunologic inflammatory central nervous system disease is experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, which can be induced in animals or in human beings by the intradermal injection of either of two myelin proteins \u2014 myelin basic protein[13](#core-r013) or proteolipid apoprotein,[14](#core-r014)4 with an adjuvant that induces local inflammation and may allow a change in the normally existing tolerance to autoantigens. A major contribution to the understanding of human disease that studies of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis have made is that a very small inoculum of activated T-cell clones that recognize small fragments of either of these two myelin proteins can induce inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system.[15,16](#core-r015) Such studies have demonstrated that if myelin-protein\u2014reactive T cells are allowed to become activated in vivo, the normal brain white matter can be destroyed by the immune system. Depending on the animal species, the route of injection, and the preparation of adjuvant, the experimental animal model of allergic encephalomyelitis can have a lesion ranging from acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis with substantial neutrophilic, hemorrhagic lesions[17](#core-r017) to a chronic demyelinating lesion with a lymphocytic infiltrate similar to that of multiple sclerosis.[18](#core-r018)Do autoreactive T cells exist in human beings? Although it has been demonstrated convincingly that T cells become \"educated,\" or major-histocompatibility-complex\u2014restricted in the thymus gland, with deletion of autoreactive T cells, more recent data indicate that other mechanisms besides clonal deletion in the thymus are operative in preventing autoimmunity.[19](#core-r019) We have examined the peripheral blood of many normal persons by T-cell cloning techniques that allow the expansion of T cells that may normally be closely regulated in vivo. Many if not all persons have T-cell clones from their peripheral blood that recognize cell antigens \u2014 in these experiments, myelin basic protein.[20](#core-r020) The mechanism used to control circulating autoreactive T cells has been termed \"peripheral tolerance\" as opposed to thymic or central tolerance. The recent discovery that important regulatory T-cell surface molecules that control phosphorylation \u2014 i.e., CD4 and CD8 \u2014 are linked to a tyrosine kinase[21](#core-r021) and that CD45 (2H4 and UCHL-1) has tyrosine phosphatase activity[22](#core-r022) suggests a central role of phosphorylation and second-messenger systems in the regulation of the immune responses in autoimmunity. In this regard it has been shown that decreases in the expression of a CD45RA (2H4) isoform on CD4-positive T cells are closely linked to the alterations of immune function observed in a number of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus.[23](#core-r023)Precisely what triggers this loss of peripheral tolerance in human beings is not known. It can be postulated that adjuvants such as Freund's, which contains mycobacterium emulsified in oil, may induce a state of altered, nonspecific immunodysregulation as observed in human autoimmune diseases. It has also been postulated that viruses can act by a similar mechanism to alter the immune balance. For example, an experimental coronavirus infection in rats resulted in myelin-basic-protein\u2014reactive T-cell clones capable of inducing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.[24](#core-r024) In human beings antecedent viral infections have been associated with the assumed autoimmune disease acute inflammatory polyneuropathy, or the Guillain\u2014Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In acute inflammatory polyneuropathy it has been postulated that a number of common viruses induce an antigen-nonspecific immunodysregulatory signal that allows the autoimmune process to occur.[25](#core-r025) Whether viruses induce autoreactive T cells in human beings by a mechanism similar to that observed with coronavirus in rats is as yet unknown.I shall discuss together the presumably autoimmune inflammatory human diseases that are specific to the central nervous system white matter \u2014 disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis, and multiple sclerosis, since they may reflect a single pathologic process with different clinical expressions.Postviral encephalitis often occurs after a number of common viral infections, including measles, varicella, rubella, vaccinia, mumps, Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection, influenza, and herpes zoster infection. Rabies and vaccinia immunizations have also been associated with postvaccinial encephalitis.[26](#core-r026) The most often recognized antecedent event is a viral infection, particularly of the type caused by the RNA viruses that bud from infected cells. The measles virus appears to be the most potent in inducing acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and before the mass-immunization programs in the United States was most often associated with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.[26](#core-r026) After measles, rubella, and varicella the latent period between the rash and the neurologic symptoms is 5 to 13 days,[27](#core-r027) with encephalitis syndromes having the shortest latent period and transverse myelitis and polyradiculitis having the longest latent period. Otherwise, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis may present with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting, followed by a latent period of one to three weeks. Although no single symptom is pathognomonic in any particular type of postinfectious encephalomyelitis, there is a greater association of either bilateral or unilateral ataxia with preceding varicella than with measles.[28](#core-r028) A number of reports have suggested the existence of a specific neurologic syndrome associated with influenza, consisting of either a diffuse or a focal encephalomyelitis in the central nervous system or a polyneuropathy.[29](#core-r029) In contrast to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, in most cases of acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis it follows a benign upper respiratory tract infection. In 17 of 30 cases in which the histopathological criteria for the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis were fulfilled it followed measles, in 4 it followed rubella, in 6 it followed varicella, and in 1 it followed vaccinia. In contrast, in 5 of 8 cases of acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis it followed nonspecific upper respiratory tract disease, and in 3 it was unassociated with a history of antecedent illness.[30](#core-r030)The neurologic course of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis can vary from days to weeks, although it usually is uniphasic. The white-matter tracts of the cerebral hemisphere, brain stem, spinal cord, and optic nerves may be principally affected, with manifestations of hemiplegia, paraplegia, sensory defects, ataxia, optic neuritis, and other cranial-nerve palsies. Patients with acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis progress more rapidly into delirium and coma and die more frequently, with clinical findings that often suggest an expanding mass with progressive focal signs and elevated intracranial pressure.[30](#core-r030) In this case the CT scan was normal, as it was in 4 of 11 reported cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis[31](#core-r031); in contrast, a normal CT scan is unusual in cases of acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis.[32](#core-r032) The electroencephalogram in this case revealed bifrontal sharp waves and spike waves in the left hemisphere, a frequent finding in both acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis.[33](#core-r033) Other laboratory features of the disease are similarly nonspecific. In acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis or more severe forms of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis systemic laboratory studies usually are either negative or show leukocytosis, an increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or proteinuria.[27,28,34](#core-r027) The cerebrospinal fluid picture in patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis usually suggests an aseptic meningitis. In a study of 60 children with this disease the average lymphocyte count in the cerebrospinal fluid was 82 cells, with a range of 0 to 650 cells per cubic millimeter, and the average total protein level was 54 mg, with a range of 22 to 200 mg per 100 ml.[34](#core-r034) In acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis there may be over 1000 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per cubic millimeter, hundreds of red cells, and a pressure exceeding 300 mm of water in the cerebrospinal fluid.Histologic examination in cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis reveals a predominantly perivenous inflammation with lymphocytes and macrophages. In cases of acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis hemorrhage is associated with the inflammation. There has been no characterization of the T-cell populations in the brains of patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, although it might be similar to what we have observed in the brain tissue of patients with multiple sclerosis.[35](#core-r035) In brain tissue from patients with multiple sclerosis, cells expressing the CD45RA determinant, which is found on T cells with suppressor\u2014inducer function, are fewer than those in brain tissue from patients with viral encephalitis.What is the relation between experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and multiple sclerosis? In regard to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis a number of investigators have provided evidence that there is a strong proliferative response to myelin basic protein (MBP).[36\u201339](#core-r036) We have cloned T cells directly from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with postviral encephalomyelitis and observed a high frequency of MBP-reactive T cells in the spinal fluid that were not found in other inflammatory central nervous system diseases.[40](#core-r040) The role of MBP-reactive T cells in multiple sclerosis, which may be related to postinfectious encephalomyelitis, has been more difficult to ascertain. We have recently demonstrated that in HLADR2\u2014positive persons there is an immunodominant region of MBP between residues 84 and 102 that is recognized preferentially by T cells expressing the V\u03b2 17 and V\u03b2 12 T-cell\u2013receptor gene products.[41,42](#core-r041) It can be postulated that this region of the human MBP is encephalitogenic in some DR2-positive patients with multiple sclerosis.Although the differential diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis is difficult without microscopical examination, I favor the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. I believe that the patient had a primary immunologic defect with multifocal T-cell\u2014mediated inflammation and possibly demyelination of the central nervous system as opposed to primary non-immunologic central nervous system damage with secondary inflammation. Points that suggest this type of process are the viral prodrome, the multifocal neurologic lesions involving at least the brain stem and the spinal cord, the flaccid, areflexic weakness, the high spinal fluid opening pressure, the absence of malignant-tumor cells, and the negative cultures and serologic studies on repeated lumbar punctures. The high cerebrospinal fluid protein level is very unusual for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and is the finding in the cerebrospinal fluid examination that argues most strongly against this diagnosis. However, the assumed presence of severe acute inflammatory myelitis in this case might explain the high protein level. Alternatively, the diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis would explain the red cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, the high intracranial pressure, and the increased cerebrospinal fluid protein content, although this disease, like acute hemorrhagic allergic encephalomyelitis, is usually accompanied by a substantial number of neutrophils in the cerebrospinal fluid, which was not observed in this case. As is usual in the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis the initial triggering virus is not clear, but I would favor an enterovirus in view of the initial presentation. An early brain biopsy in an attempt to make the diagnosis might have been warranted in this case, since immunosuppression with intravenously administered cyclophosphamide might have been useful if the microscopical findings suggested inflammatory or demyelinating disease on an assumed autoimmune basis.My diagnosis is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, with multifocal demyelinating lesions involving the cerebrum, midbrain, and spinal cord.Dr. Raymond A. Sobel: Dr. Wityk, you were involved in the care of the patient. Do you have any comments?Dr. Robert J. Wityk: The patient was under the care of Dr. Ernest H. Picard, and I first saw him after he was transferred to the intensive care unit. Our initial consideration was a fulminant viral encephalitis primarily affecting the brain stem, and herpes simplex infection was considered the most treatable possibility.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Sobel: The general autopsy disclosed acute and organizing bronchopneumonia, with bronchiectasis, multiple lung abscesses, pleural adhesions, centrilobular hepatic necrosis, and mild generalized atherosclerosis. There was no evidence of an underlying malignant tumor or immunologic defect.The brain weighed 1590 g. The meninges were normal. Serial coronal sections of the cerebral hemispheres revealed minimal abnormalities. The white matter of the left parietal lobe was somewhat softer than that on the right side, but no discrete lesions were present. Both hippocampi appeared small. The orbital gyri, temporal lobes, and cingulate gyri were intact. A section at the level of the midbrain showed fragmentation and brown discoloration of the cerebral peduncles.The most striking abnormalities were in the brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Externally, the pons was depressed and softened. The entire basis pontis was friable, granular, and discolored. The usually visible crossing fibers were obscured. This necrotic appearance extended into both middle cerebellar peduncles and white matter in a nearly symmetric and well circumscribed pattern. The cerebellar cortex was preserved, but there were similar lesions in the medulla and inferior cerebellar white matter. Patchy areas of brown discoloration and granularity, with obliteration of the normally visible architecture, were present throughout the spinal cord. The lower portion of the cord was totally collapsed and necrotic.Microscopical examination of the pons and cerebellum demonstrated areas of massive demyelination, indicated by the loss of normal blue myelin staining affecting the basis pontis and the middle cerebellar peduncles ([Fig. 1](#f001)). This appearance is characteristic of multiple sclerosis.[43\u201345](#core-r043) Small patches of myelin loss were also seen in the more intact areas of the cerebellar white matter and around the fourth ventricle. Higher-power examination revealed that the small areas of demyelination were localized around blood vessels ([Fig. 2](#f002)). The large plaques apparently developed as a result of confluence of perivascular lesions of this type. In the medulla a single midline, well-circumscribed plaque was visible adjacent to the inferior olivary nuclei.In the spinal cord the lesions were extensive and generally symmetric, involving the lateral columns but sparing the posterior columns. This preservation of the dorsal columns above areas of complete necrosis of the cord is consistent with the acuteness of the process and the relative preservation of axons in the more caudal lesions. A band of demyelination was localized immediately beneath the pia arachnoid ([Fig. 3](#f003)), a pattern occasionally seen in human multiple sclerosis[46](#core-r046) and in experimental models of the disease.[47](#core-r047) Examination of a section of the lumbar cord disclosed complete demyelination and partial collapse ([Fig. 4](#f004)). Myelin was preserved in the proximal posterior nerve roots. There were only a few foci of demyelination in the cerebral hemispheres, and the optic chiasm, optic and other cranial nerves, and peripheral nerves were free of lesions. We observed no old, clinically silent plaques. Thus, the illness was monophasic by pathological as well as clinical criteria.There were sharp margins between intact myelinated white matter and demyelinated plaques. At the edges of the plaques there were perivenous foci of inflammatory cells consisting of lymphocytes, macro-phages, and some plasma cells. The plaque centers contained sheets of foamy macrophages that were stained a faint blue because they had phagocytosed lipid-rich myelin. Even in the most severely affected areas we could find selective preservation of vessels and neuronal cell bodies. The overall degree of nervefiber destruction was demonstrated in Bodian impregnations of the pons and cerebellum ([Fig. 5](#f005)). The greatest destruction was found in the centers of the plaques and in the cord. In some plaques there was greater preservation of axons, but the presence of axonal swellings indicated axonal damage ([Fig. 6](#f006)). Thus, although this was a destructive lesion, it fell short of the global necrosis that is found, for example, in an ischemic infarct or in typical herpes simplex encephalitis. The concept of a demyelinative disease implies relative preservation of axons, although it is well recognized that axonal injury may be present in the lesions of multiple sclerosis.We characterized the cellular immune response by immunohistochemical staining. Cryostat sections of the pons were immunostained with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to identify inflammatory-cell surface antigens and other molecules in the lesions. The lymphocytes were principally T cells, as shown with use of an antibody to CD3 that recognizes most T cells ([Fig. 7](#f007)). The T cells were located in the perivascular cuffs and infiltrated the parenchyma, both in demyelinated areas and in more normal-appearing white matter. B cells expressing the CD20 antigen were very rare ([Fig. 7](#f007)). There were variable numbers of cells expressing T-cell\u2014subset antigens such as CD45R,[48](#core-r048) adhesion molecules such as LFA-1, and major-histocompatibility-complex molecules. We also identified plasma components that are deposited in the lesions of multiple sclerosis. For example, fibrinogen was localized between macrophages in the center of a plaque ([Fig. 8](#f008)). Deposition of such molecules in immune-reaction sites may be important for inflammatory-cell migration and phagocytosis of myelin in the lesions.[49](#core-r049) Reactive astrocytes, as identified in a stain for glial fibrillary acidic protein, were scattered throughout the plaques and were more numerous in better preserved areas. It has been suggested that astrocytes contribute to the lesions of multiple sclerosis by acting as antigen-presenting cells[50,51](#core-r050) and by preventing remyelination or healing.[52](#core-r052)In summary, the major histologic features of the lesions in the central nervous system were demyelination, partial preservation of axons and neuron-cell bodies, principally T-cell inflammatory infiltrates, and gliosis. There was also secondary chronic hypoxic injury in the hippocampi, consistent with the patient's terminal course.The clinical diagnosis at the time of autopsy was viral encephalitis. The history of genital herpes infection suggested the possibility that herpes simplex virus Type 2 had been a causative agent, as in other reported cases of brain-stem encephalitis and myelitis due to herpes viruses.[53\u201357](#core-r053) However, the pattern of tissue injury, with relative neuron-cell-body and axon preservation, would be unusual for a herpesvirus infection. Microglial nodules, hallmarks of central nervous system viral infection, also were not prominent, and no viral inclusions were observed. Postmortem central nervous system viral cultures, an ultrastructural examination for viral particles, and extensive immunohistochemical analyses of affected portions of the central nervous system for various herpes antigens were all negative. Furthermore, there had been no rise in the patient's serum antiviral titers over the course of the disease. Although a virus cause may underlie some demyelinating conditions,[58\u201360](#core-r058) that sequence is unproved in this case. It is possible that there was an acute infection at the onset. In view of the experience with animal models of multiple sclerosis one might speculate that an infectious agent could either injure the central nervous system directly or act as an adjuvant \u2014 that is, a cofactor or nonspecific stimulus to the immune system. In someone with a predisposition, such a stimulus could facilitate an inflammatory response in the central nervous system. Because of early treatment with antibiotics and acyclovir or perhaps because of the vigorous T-cell response a putative infectious agent may have been eradicated in this case, thereby accounting for our inability to detect it in the central nervous system at autopsy.We usually think of multiple sclerosis as a chronic disease with multifocal lesions of various ages. In this case the duration of the disease was short, and the lesions were uniform from the viewpoint of the degree of injury and the inflammatory response. The finding of periventricular plaques in the hemispheres and the brain stem is frequent in patients with typical multiple sclerosis, but there was minimal disease above the tentorium and the periventricular areas and optic nerves were spared in this case. Although this distribution of the lesions was unusual, the essential features of multiple sclerosis were present according to histopathological criteria. This case resembles some cases of acute multiple sclerosis in the series reported by Adams and Kubik[43](#core-r043) from this hospital and a recent case reported by Mendez and Pogacar.[61](#core-r061) In those cases the disease was also monophasic and rapidly fatal. The degree of nerve-fiber damage in the case under discussion was at the more severe end of a spectrum. Although the perivascular localization of some lesions suggested acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or postviral or postvaccinial leukoencephalopathy, the large, confluent nature of most of the lesions would be unusual for that group of disorders.[43,44](#core-r043)The interrelation of the cellular expression and the localization of the T-cell antigens and other molecules in cellular immune reactions in general and their roles in the pathogenesis of the lesions of multiple sclerosis in particular are incompletely understood and are the focus of intense research effort. Studies of central nervous system tissues of patients who have died with multiple sclerosis are especially important in these endeavors, because they permit extrapolations to live patients with multiple sclerosis, who presumably have similar immunopathologic processes occurring in their central nervous systems when they have acute relapses. The observations on T-cell antigen expression are consistent with the widely held view that immunologic mechanisms are of primary importance in the pathogenesis of the lesions of multiple sclerosis instead of merely indicating secondary responses.[62](#core-r062) However, the nature of the immunologic trigger or triggers for these responses, either infectious or autoimmune, eludes us at present.Dr. Hafler: Were you able to quantitate the number of CD45RA-positive cells in the brain of this patient to compare it with what has been found on previous examinations in patients with viral encephalitis and multiple sclerosis?[32](#core-r032)Dr. Sobel: Because of the unusual and relatively focal distribution of the lesions in this case we did not do as exhaustive a survey as we were able to do in other cases. The number of CD45R-positive cells in the sample studied was in between what we had previously found in comparisons of viral encephalitis and multiple sclerosis. In none of the cases of multiple sclerosis that we studied previously[32](#core-r032) was the duration of disease as short as it was in this case.Dr. Hafler: The differentiation between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and acute multiple sclerosis raises a number of very interesting issues. The first is whether there is a fundamental pathophysiologic difference between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis or whether multiple sclerosis is a chronic manifestation of the more acute disseminating encephalomyelitis. Secondly, is the demyelination observed in multiple sclerosis secondary to chronic inflammation in the central nervous system white matter? This case is illustrative of the potential gradient among the inflammatory, presumably autoimmune demyelinating central nervous system diseases.Dr. Sobel: The differentiation was certainly a clinical problem in this case. One might draw an analogy to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, in which there also is a neuropathological spectrum ranging from acute to chronic lesions.[63](#core-r063) In the animal model a host of factors, including age, genetic background, adjuvants, and sensitizing antigens, may affect the clinical and pathologic manifestations of the disease.\n",

      "question": "A 71-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of a rash, diffuse muscle weakness, and respiratory failure.\nThere was a long history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and alcoholism. The patient had been in stable health until two or three months before entry, when a diffuse maculopapular erythematous rash developed. It improved with prednisone therapy but flared when the dose was tapered, with the onset of difficulty in walking and arising from a chair. Twenty-six days before admission he experienced sudden right flank pain and was admitted to another hospital.\nOn physical examination a diffuse erythematous scaling rash was present; no costovertebral-angle tenderness was found. The urine was normal. The laboratory values during this admission and the later admission are presented in\nTable 1\n,\nTable 2\n,\nTable 3\n, and\nTable 4\n. Radiographs of the chest and abdomen were normal. An ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen and kidneys and an intravenous pyelographic examination were negative.\nBenzodiazepine, ranitidine, and methylprednisolone (125 mg every eight hours) were administered, with disappearance of the flank pain, followed by the onset of \u201cstinging\u201d pains that \u201cshot down the legs.\u201d The patient subsequently became unable to move his extremities, sit up, or draw a deep breath. On the sixth hospital day the rash and weakness were improved, and prednisone (20 mg twice daily) was substituted for methylprednisolone. On the next day the patient experienced diffuse myalgia and arthralgia and was unable to stand because of weakness of the legs; methylprednisolone was promptly resumed. On the ninth hospital day dyspnea developed and was associated with leukocytosis. Hypoxemia developed, and pulmonary infiltrates were demonstrated on radiologic examination on the 12th hospital day. Ceftriaxone was administered. Microscopical examination of a biopsy specimen of the skin showed findings consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum, and examination of a biopsy specimen of bone marrow revealed 15 percent plasma cells, a finding consistent with multiple myeloma. On the 26th hospital day the patient was transferred to this hospital, receiving methylprednisolone (20 mg by vein every eight hours), ranitidine, allopurinol, furosemide, antibiotics, and pancuronium bromide and morphine sulfate as required.\nThe temperature was 36.4 \u00b0C, the pulse 64, and the blood pressure 205/105 mm Hg; the patient was undergoing mechanical ventilation at a rate of 12 breaths per minute.\nOn physical examination the patient was sedated but arousable, with occasional spontaneous movements. On neurologic examination he blinked his eyelids on verbal command; he moved his eyes fully and furrowed his brow bilaterally. The right pupil was eccentric, 2 mm in diameter, and reactive to light; the left pupil was 1.5 mm and minimally reactive. Diffuse tremulous movements of the jaw were noted. The extremities were flaccid and areflexic, with no response to noxious stimuli.\nThe urine gave a ++++ result for glucose and negative results for protein and ketones; the specific gravity was 1.015; the sediment contained 2 white cells and 15 red cells per high-power field. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was undergoing mechanical ventilation with 60 percent oxygen, showed that the partial pressure of oxygen was 99 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide 36 mm Hg, and the pH 7.55. An electrocardiogram disclosed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 59, with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Radiographs of the chest showed a right pleural effusion. A computed tomographic (CT) cranial scan revealed severe central and peripheral cerebral atrophy. A skeletal survey and an ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys were negative. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (\nFigure 1\n) showed thickening of the rectal wall and perirectal soft tissues and poor renal opacification; edema and stranding of the subcutaneous tissues, retroperitoneum, and presacral space, small bilateral pleural effusions, and a small amount of ascitic fluid were observed.\nConduction studies of five motor nerves revealed compound motor-action potentials of very low amplitude, normal distal latencies, and a slight reduction in maximal motor-conduction velocities. Sensory-nerve action potentials were unobtainable in either sural nerve or in the left median and ulnar nerves. Blink-reflex latencies were normal. Electromyographic examination of multiple proximal and distal muscles showed abundant fibrillations and positive sharp waves; no voluntary activity was elicited from most limb muscles.\nMicroscopical examination of a biopsy specimen of bone marrow showed scattered plasma cells, with rare cytologic atypia and benign-appearing lymphoid aggregates but no evidence of plasma-cell myeloma. Immunofluorescence studies revealed no evidence of a clonal B-cell population. Microscopical examination of a quadriceps-muscle-biopsy specimen showed myonecrosis, denervation, and regeneration, without evidence of vasculitis or active myositis. Examination of a sural-nerve-biopsy specimen disclosed marked depletion of myelinated nerve fibers, a moderate reduction in axons, and myelin ovoids, indicative of acute axonopathy. A test for viral hepatitis C antibodies was positive; the \u03b2\n2\n-macroglobulin was 6.9 U (normal, 0.7 to 3.4). Serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a normal IgG precipitin arc, an abnormal IgA arc, and no visible IgM arc. Agarose-gel electrophoresis revealed several bands in the gamma globulin zone; one of the bands appeared to be an IgA lambda M component, and another was an IgG kappa M component in low concentration. No Bence Jones protein was detected in a 50-fold concentrated urine specimen.\nEarly in the hospital course the patient had marked autonomic instability, with a heart rate that ranged between 30 and 90 beats per minute; intermittent hypotension was managed with intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, which were followed by bouts of hypertension. Plasmapheresis was performed on five occasions, followed by questionable transitory recovery of slight movement about the shoulder girdles and elbows. Melphalan and an adrenocorticosteroid medication were administered, without a decrease of the IgA level to normal. During the final week of life Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, paralytic ileus, and perforation of the urinary bladder occurred.\nOn the 50th hospital day the patient was alert and responded appropriately to single commands. Partial bilateral ptosis, slight limitation of upward gaze, and mild weakness of the orbicularis oculi muscles were present; the pupils were normal. The intrinsic hand and distal forearm muscles were wasted. There was 2/5 power in the deltoid and biceps muscles and in the intrinsic muscles of the left hand; no movement was detected in the other upper-extremity muscles or in the legs; the patient was areflexic. Loss of sensory responses to all stimuli extended to the levels of the mid-forearm and upper thighs.\nOn the 54th hospital day the patient died.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Allan H. Ropper[\\*](#FN1): This elderly man's basic problems were an unusual paraproteinemia and weakness due to a generalized neuropathy.His health was stable until a maculopapular rash developed and prednisone was prescribed. Soon after the dose was tapered the first neurologic symptom, proximal weakness, occurred. On admission to another hospital for flank pain the patient reported stinging pain that shot down his legs, probably signifying a disturbance of sensory roots or ganglia. The weakness was steroid-responsive. Generalized weakness is often not evident or is disregarded in the presence of other medical diseases. When finally recognized, proximal weakness, in particular, is frequently attributed to the general debility caused by an underlying disease or to a myopathy, although neuropathies are a far more common cause of proximal weakness. Also, the patient had autonomic instability, with variations in the heart rate and blood pressure early in the illness. The triad of generalized weakness, sensory symptoms, and dysautonomia suggests a polyneuropathy rather than a myopathy, a myelopathy, or brain disease. The tempo of the progression and the subsequent electrophysiologic features will be useful in the differential diagnosis.The flaccid, areflexic, complete limb paralysis observed on neurologic examination confirmed the clinical impression of a peripheral neuropathy. He had \u201cno response to noxious stimuli,\u201d presumably because of paralysis but also because of severe sensory loss since he was awake and voluntarily able to blink and move his eyes. Although no measurements were made, his continued respiratory failure in the absence of parenchymal lung disease was probably also neuromuscular and related to the generalized paralysis. There are three signposts of the tempo of the neuropathy. His initial proximal weakness occurred at least one month before he entered the first hospital. Soon thereafter he was too weak to sit up or move his extremities. When he entered this hospital two months after the first weakness he was quadriplegic. This rate of progression indicated subacute generalized sensorimotor neuropathy with a more acute deterioration over a period of one or two weeks.The electrophysiologic tests showed a severe axonal polyneuropathy (low-amplitude muscle potentials and abundant fibrillation potentials) without demyelination, since there were normal distal latencies, only minimally reduced conduction velocities, and normal blink reflexes. Several days before his death the presence of muscle wasting in the hands and forearms corroborated the axonal nature of the polyneuropathy. The best evidence for a demyelinating neuropathy was the inability to contract voluntarily some muscles that could be stimulated electrically, perhaps suggesting proximal conduction block. The inability to elicit sensory-action potentials in any nerve tested signified a sensory neuropathy distal to the dorsal-root ganglia, although not necessarily sparing the sensory roots. There were no inexcitable motor nerves. A sural-nerve biopsy showed severe large-fiber loss, which was apparently primarily axonal.Except for the inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies, such as the Guillain-Barre syndrome, most polyneuropathies are related to medical diseases, with different causes of axonal and demyelinating forms. There are numerous causes of subacute axonal neuropathy ([Table 5](#t05)). The common metabolic causes of neuropathies due, for example, to diabetes or alcoholism, as well as countless other causes are not associated with this severe and relatively rapid paralysis and respiratory failure. Acute toxic neuropathy, such as that due to heavy metals, would be unlikely to progress so much under observation and was excluded by laboratory testing. Renal-failure neuropathy, which can be surprisingly rapid but infrequently so severe, occurs with renal failure more profound than occurred in this case. Intermittent acute porphyria must be considered, especially in view of the early autonomic instability, but the other cardinal features of porphyria or a preceding history were absent, as was porphobilinogen. Sarcoidosis and autoimmune diseases that may be associated with subacute inflammatory neuropathies were excluded by the absence of consistent laboratory or clinical features. Paracarcinomatous neuropathies are rarely so severe, and there was no evidence of cancer in this patient.This patient's illness simulated the Guillain-Barre syndrome, the most common form of severe areflexic paralysis with a raised spinal fluid protein level[1\u20133](#core-r001). However, that syndrome is an acute, monophasic illness with its progression arbitrarily limited to four weeks, although \u201cchronic Guillain-Barre syndrome,\u201d now called \u201cchronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy,\u201d typically advances over a longer period or relapses[4](#core-r004). The tempo of this patient's illness was more nearly that of the subacute Guillain-Barre syndrome, which develops over four to eight weeks and may be steroid-responsive[5\u20137](#core-r005). From a purely syndromic point of view this patient's illness fits into the category of the subacute Guillain-Barre syndrome.These inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies share the features of conduction block, conduction slowing or other electrophysiologic signs of demyelination, and spinal-fluid \u201calbuminocytologic dissociation\u201d (elevated protein content without cells). The axonal features in this case are unusual, although there is an \u201caxonal\u201d Guillain-Barre syndrome, which designates a severe, rapidly progressive polyneuropathy with many electrically inexcitable nerves, few sensory features, and normal or nearly normal spinal fluid protein[8](#core-r008). In many cases of what appears to be axonal Guillain-Barre syndrome it is initially demyelinating, and an electromyographic study obtained late in the course, as it was in this case, may be misleading. There were no signs of demyelination to support the typical form of the disease, and there were no inexcitable motor nerves, the progression was too slow, the sensory loss was too severe, and the cerebrospinal fluid protein level was too high for the axonal variant[9](#core-r009). However, the resemblance of the findings in this case to a subacute Guillain-Barre syndrome is pivotal, because many subacute neuropathies, with or without demyelinating features, are associated with underlying systemic diseases. Rapid fluctuations as a result of changes in steroid dose have also been markers for underlying disease on occasion, although idiopathic chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy has often responded to steroids as well. In this patient the slow evolution to profound weakness and the clinical changes with steroids compel a search for an underlying disease as the cause of the polyneuropathy.The second major feature of the illness was an unusual IgA-lambda M component with a concentration of 1135 mg per deciliter. In view of the association of 10 percent of neuropathies with paraproteins[10](#core-r010) ([Table 5](#t05)), this paraprotein may be an important marker for a systemic disease. It had a role in the overall illness, because pyoderma gangrenosum, a nonspecific lesion typically associated with ulcerative colitis, can result from monoclonal or biclonal gammopathies, the majority of which are IgA, as in this patient[11\u201313](#core-r011).Paraproteinemia can also be a marker for lymphoma, which in turn is rarely associated with a neuropathy resembling chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, but there was no evidence of lymphoma in this case. Since most paraproteinemias of this small magnitude do not progress to myeloma, another consideration is a polyneuropathy due to a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Both axonal and demyelinating neuropathies have been described with what used to be called \u201cbenign monoclonal gammopathy\u201d ([Figure 2](#f02)). They tend to be chronic, predominantly sensory, distal, and mild, generally unlike the picture in this case[10,14](#core-r010). Paraproteinemic neuropathies have been divided into IgM and non-IgM (IgA and IgG) categories, because half of IgM neuropathies have a characteristic insidious, predominantly sensory syndrome, with a greatly elevated spinal fluid protein level and a specific antiglycolipid antibody against myelin surface antigen, a myelin-associated glycoprotein. The non-IgM group, however, may be associated with severe weakness, and this patient conceivably had an atypical MGUS-related axonal polyneuropathy. The distinction from other paraproteinemic neuropathies depends on the absence of a biologically more complex disease, such as a plasma-cell dyscrasia.Polyneuropathies are associated with multiple myeloma in 3 to 5 percent of the patients, although many more patients have electrophysiologic evidence of nerve disease ([Figure 2](#f02))[15,16](#core-r015). The most distinctive pattern in myeloma neuropathy is a sensory and autonomic syndrome due to amyloid deposition, which does not apply in this case. The other myeloma neuropathies include a distal axonal polyneuropathy with mild weakness and a sensory polyneuropathy closely resembling the paraneoplastic syndrome of Denny-Brown, both of which can occur with or without amyloid deposition. In occasional cases the disorder simulates the Guillain-Barre syndrome or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The axonal polyneuropathy of myeloma tends to affect elderly men, and in some cases it has been predominantly motor and very severe, as in this patient, with the neuropathy obscuring the underlying multiple myeloma[15\u201317](#core-r015). The typical myeloma neuropathy is gradually progressive, distally predominant, and mild, sparing cranial nerves. It is associated with only minimal elevation of the cerebrospinal fluid protein level and is seen in cases of florid disease with high levels of paraprotein, usually over 3 g per deciliter. In many ways the axonal syndrome resembling the Guillain-Barre syndrome and the medical context in this patient resemble myeloma neuropathy, but it is difficult to make the diagnosis of multiple myeloma in this case.Features against the diagnosis of myeloma in this case include the low concentration of paraprotein, the absence of bone pain, lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, and Bence Jones light chains, the normal IgG level, and the negative second bone marrow biopsy. The spinal fluid protein level was also considerably higher than is usual for myeloma neuropathies. The renal failure was mostly prerenal, a finding inconsistent with myeloma nephropathy. In favor of myeloma are the diagnosis of myeloma on the first bone marrow examination, the persistent, greatly elevated sedimentation rate, the normocytic anemia, and the unchanged paraprotein levels after treatment with melphalan, prednisone, and plasma exchange. \u201cSmoldering\u201d myeloma[18](#core-r018) requires a paraprotein level above 3 g per deciliter, but the bone lesions, renal failure, and other typical manifestations of myeloma do not develop for months or years.There is a distinctive neuropathy associated with sclerotic myeloma or plasmacytoma. Few patients with myeloma have osteosclerotic lesions, but over half of those with sclerotic lesions have neuropathy. Furthermore, the paraprotein is usually an IgA or IgG in small concentrations, almost always with a lambda light chain,[19\u201321](#core-r019) whereas only a third of M proteins from multiple myeloma or MGUS have a lambda light chain. Of all the neuropathies with plasma-cell dyscrasias, the type associated with sclerotic myeloma is most likely to become severe, and the cerebrospinal fluid protein level tends to be very high, often over 200 mg per deciliter. Electrophysiologic studies may show demyelination with some axonal features, but a primarily axonal process with secondary segmental demyelination has been described[22](#core-r022) most often and might result in findings similar to those in this case.The osteosclerotic myeloma neuropathy tends to be associated with edema and involvement of systemic organs. One particular constellation that has been highlighted consists of polyneuropathy, organomegaly or lymphadenopathy, endocrinopathy, and skin changes, mainly hyperpigmentation but also sclerodermatous thickening or papular angiomas, given the acronym POEMS[21](#core-r021) to signify the polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes ([Figure 2](#f02)). POEMS, strictly speaking, requires osteosclerotic myeloma and the four other features, but few of the patients have more than two or three of these features and the syndrome or fragments of it may occur without sclerotic myeloma. From my experience with several patients who had IGM-lambda paraproteins and skin changes, but not osteosclerotic myeloma, I cannot agree with recent studies that equate POEMS with osteosclerotic myeloma[23](#core-r023).The eponym \u201cCrow-Fukase syndrome\u201d[24\u201326](#core-r024) does not require all the components of POEMS, occurs without sclerotic bone lesions, and includes clinical features of the syndrome beyond POEMS ([Figure 2](#f02)), such as fluctuating azotemia, soft-tissue and limb edema, lymphocytic infiltrates in muscle, steroid responsiveness of the neuropathy, a low serum paraprotein level, and mild bone marrow plasmacytosis,[24\u201327](#core-r024) all of which were present in this case. The two central features of the Crow-Fukase syndrome are the polyneuropathy and the lambda paraproteinemia.May we review the radiologic findings?Dr. Giles W. Boland: The abdominal and pelvic CT scan ([Figure 1](#f01)), obtained with the intravenous administration of contrast material, shows small pleural effusions and a small amount of ascites. Widespread strands of soft-tissue density consistent with edema are most notable in the subcutaneous tissues, the retroperitoneum, the abdominal and pelvic mesentery, and the presacral space. There is rectal-wall thickening, which is also consistent with edema.Dr. Ropper: In addition to its peculiar distribution, this patient's edema was not due to congestive heart failure, water overload, or renal failure, since the sodium was 152 mmol per liter and the urea nitrogen was 128 mg per deciliter, whereas the creatinine was 1 to 2 mg per deciliter, suggesting dehydration. The small pleural effusions and ascites may have been part of the POEMS edema syndrome[28,29](#core-r028).The most frequent initial findings in the Crow-Fukase syndrome[25](#core-r025) are related to the polyneuropathy and edema. Nail clubbing and hyperhidrosis are common but were absent in this patient. Glucose intolerance occurs in about a third of the cases. Gynecomastia and impotence, which are present in two thirds of the patients with the Crow-Fukase syndrome, are not mentioned in this case. In 95 percent of cases of the syndrome there is either an IgG or IgA lambda M component, and in about 10 percent it becomes biclonal, as it eventually did in this patient. The other hematologic characteristics of the Crow-Fukase syndrome were also present in this case: no skeletal lesions in a third to half of the cases; a low concentration of paraprotein; and normal concentrations of other immunoglobulin subclasses.The plasma-cell excess in the Crow-Fukase syndrome varies from a mild monoclonal plasmacytosis to frank myeloma. In Japan, where myeloma is uncommon, half the patients with the Crow-Fukase syndrome have no bone lesions but do have increased numbers of plasma cells in the marrow[24,25](#core-r024). Most non-Japanese patients, in contrast, have plasma-cell dyscrasias, evenly divided among sclerotic, lytic, and mixed myeloma[25](#core-r025). The polyneuropathy seems to be tied to the other parts of the syndrome solely by the lambda IgA or IgG paraprotein rather than by the plasma-cell disorder. Furthermore, most patients without bone lesions have also had Castleman's disease of the lymph nodes.In view of the findings on the first bone marrow biopsy in this case a myeloma or plasma-cell excess is very likely, probably with monoclonal lambda-producing cells. I believe that the axonal polyneuropathy was related to the paraprotein and plasma-cell disorder, and in combination with other clinical features I would link the illness to the Crow-Fukase syndrome. The case may be unique in the extreme axonal nature of the electrophysiologic findings. If this is all correct, then despite the low concentration of paraprotein and the negative second bone marrow examination this man probably had multiple myeloma. Neuropathological examination probably revealed a widespread polyneuropathy with a predominant loss of large fibers, including autonomic fibers, in view of the cardiovascular instability. If inflammation was present, it would establish the illness as a secondary inflammatory polyneuropathy.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Ann C. McKee: The examination of the specimen from the right sural nerve biopsy specimen revealed marked depletion of myelinated nerve fibers, with a normal appearance of the remaining myelin. Staining with Bodian's silver method demonstrated a marked reduction in the number of axons. Teased-fiber preparations showed no evidence of segmental demyelination. The internodal lengths did not vary, and there was no evidence of well-myelinated internodes alternating with thinly myelinated internodes, as would be expected in segmental demyelination with remyelination. There were numerous clusters of myelin ovoids, providing unequivocal evidence of active axonal degeneration ([Figure 3](#f03)). Evaluation of 1-micrometer epon-embedded sections ([Figure 4](#f04)) confirmed the severe loss of nerve fibers, with abundant connective tissue.The findings at general autopsy were multiple myeloma with atypical plasma cells in the vertebral bone marrow, a monoclonal production of IgA lambda, and a single microscopic tumor nodule in the vertebral bone marrow.Microscopical examination of the brain and spinal cord revealed slight lymphocytic infiltration of the leptomeninges of the brain stem and spinal cord but no evidence of a plasma-cell infiltrate or lymphoma. At the midbrain level, mild myelinated nerve-fiber loss and lymphocytic infiltration of the third cranial nerve were seen. Staining with the Bielschowsky silver method showed a reduced number of axons and occasional degenerating axons. At the root exit zone of the vagus nerve we found a small cluster of lymphocytes and severe depletion of myelinated fibers.Examination of the posterior columns of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord showed gliosis, demyelination, and active wallerian degeneration, most severe in the fasciculus gracilis. Examination of the anterior horn cells at all levels showed pronounced central chromatolysis, with rounding of the cell-body periphery (changes indicating severe axonal injury) and mild wallerian degeneration in the lateral corticospinal tracts with astrocytosis and macrophage infiltration. At all levels of the spinal cord there was moderate loss of myelinated nerve fibers and axons from the anterior and posterior roots. The sciatic nerve had extensive nerve-fiber loss, with scattered clusters of lymphocytes and occasional macrophages ([Figure 5](#f05)). The lymphocytic infiltration was principally endoneurial and perivenular. Immunoperoxidase studies of the inflammatory infiltrate disclosed predominant T cells and occasional macrophages ([Figure 6](#f06)). Examination with Bielschowsky's silver stain revealed severe loss of axons, frequent beading of axons, and occasional axonal spheroids and varicosities. In the dorsal-root ganglia there were scattered nodules of Nageotte (indicators of ganglion-cell loss) and focal lymphocytic infiltrates. Examination of the sympathetic ganglia also showed loss of ganglion cells and lymphocytic infiltration ([Figure 7](#f07)). There was severe denervation atrophy of all the skeletal muscles sampled.These findings indicate an extensive inflammatory polyneuritis, and the absence of pathological evidence of segmental demyelination and the unequivocal presence of active axonal degeneration indicate a primary axonopathy.The regional pattern of alterations most closely resembles that seen in the Guillain-Barre syndrome. The involvement of the 3rd and 10th cranial nerves, motor and sensory peripheral nerves, and sensory and autonomic ganglia[30\u201332](#core-r030) as well as the presence of endoneurial and perivascular inflammatory cells, specifically T cells and macrophages, is characteristic of that disorder[32,33](#core-r032). In this case, however, nerve-fiber degeneration was axonal and not directed at the myelin sheath, unlike the vast majority of cases of the Guillain-Barre syndrome. Although the demyelinating polyneuropathy of the Guillain-Barre syndrome may be accompanied by secondary wallerian degeneration,[34,35](#core-r034) only 11 cases of this syndrome with a primary axonopathy and little or no preceding demyelination have been reported[8,35\u201337](#core-r008). Furthermore, in 9 of those 11 cases the diagnosis of a primary axonopathy was made on the basis of electrophysiologic studies, and electrophysiologic evidence of demyelination disappears in the presence of severe secondary axonal degeneration[38](#core-r038). Two patients with a diagnosis of the axonal variant of the Guillain-Barre syndrome have had histologic evaluation. Peroneal-nerve biopsies performed on day 30 in one patient disclosed acute axonopathy with little inflammation,[37](#core-r037) and examination at autopsy of another patient 26 days after the onset of symptoms[8](#core-r008) revealed axonal degeneration and occasional regeneration in the vagus nerves and cervical and lumbar nerve roots and axonal degeneration in the superficial peroneal and phrenic nerves; central chromatolytic changes were found in the cervical and sacral anterior horn cells. In contrast to the case under discussion, there was minimal lymphocytic infiltration. If the disorder in this case represents the axonal variant of the Guillain-Barre syndrome, not only is it unusual in its clinical presentation, but it is also the first reported case of an inflammatory polyneuropathy in this syndrome.The other primary diagnostic consideration is a neuropathy associated with myeloma, in which there is usually segmental demyelination with secondary axonal degeneration[16,17](#core-r016). In one study,[39](#core-r039) however, sural-nerve biopsies in four of five patients revealed only axonal degeneration. Inflammation is typically absent[16,17,39,40](#core-r016) and, when present, is generally minimal, consisting of scattered epineurial lymphocytes,[16,17](#core-r016) abnormal collections of plasma cells,[16,17,41,42](#core-r016) or histiocytic granulomas[41](#core-r041) -- features absent in the case under discussion. Inflammation and neuronal loss may be found in the dorsal-root ganglia in myeloma-associated neuropathy, but they are usually limited[17](#core-r017). The typical pathological features of the polyneuropathy associated with osteosclerotic myeloma are also axonal degeneration and segmental demyelination,[19,43\u201347](#core-r019) which some investigators believe are secondary to axonal attenuation[45](#core-r045). Unlike the endoneurial and pericapillary infiltrates in this case, only mild lymphocytic infiltrates largely limited to the epineurium have been described[17,48,49](#core-r017).This case, then, has features of both the Guillain-Barre syndrome and the neuropathy associated with myeloma, particularly the osteosclerotic form, but it is not typical of either entity. Although the case is best described as a primary axonal polyneuritis arising in association with IgA lambda myeloma, its precise classification must await future insights.\n\nAddendum\n--------\n\nDr. Ropper: The clinical and pathological features of this axonal polyneuritis with myeloma are unusual, if not unique. I concluded that this illness was too aberrant to be the axonal variant of the Guillain-Barre syndrome, because the weakness progressed and fluctuated subacutely over weeks and because the characteristic inexcitable nerves on electrophysiologic testing were absent. Moreover, the idiopathic or postinfectious Guillain-Barre syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, not a pathological diagnosis, and the presence of a major underlying disease that is known to be associated with polyneuropathy stretches the use of the term.The most interesting finding, the presence of endoneurial lymphocytic infiltrates, indicates that there are several pathologically distinct acute immune polyneuropathies, one of which is the classic Guillain-Barre syndrome. These polyneuropathies are as follows: the most common typical inflammatory perivascular demyelination that has the appearance of an allergic process (classic Guillain-Barre syndrome)[31](#core-r031); demyelination with minimal or no inflammation[30,32](#core-r030); the axonal form of the Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is essentially noninflammatory; and as in this case an inflammatory process with active degeneration of axons as shown by myelin ovoids.Therefore, an important feature, endoneurial inflammation, is shared with the Guillain-Barre syndrome, but it may be best to classify this patient's disease among the paraproteinemic illnesses because of the dissimilarity to any previous clinical or pathological case and the compelling connection between the polyneuropathy and the myeloma. An axonal polyneuropathy is more likely to be associated with myeloma than with the Crow-Fukase syndrome; however, most of the patients in the largest series of cases of the Crow-Fukase syndrome had some inexcitable nerves, particularly in the legs, and a number of the patients were found to have a pure axonal process on nerve biopsy[26](#core-r026). The pathological findings in this case are atypical for either disease, although in occasional cases of paraproteinemic or paramyelomatous neuropathies there have been inflammatory changes,[18](#core-r018) and they are rarely seen in osteosclerotic myeloma[48](#core-r048). These crossover cases between paraproteinemic and inflammatory axonal neuropathies are one way to relate the polyneuropathy, lambda paraproteinemia, aberrant myeloma, and systemic features. An immunologic effect of the paraprotein was possibly responsible for the nerve damage.\n",

      "question": "First admission\n. A 60-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of anorexia. He was well until two months previously, when anorexia, fatigue, and dyspnea developed, and he entered another hospital because of a question of pneumonia. Laboratory studies revealed that the thyroxine was reduced; the triiodothyronine resin uptake was normal. Thyroid hormone, 60 mg daily, was prescribed, and erythromycin was given. After discharge anorexia persisted, with occasional vomiting and a loss of 4 kg in weight. He was referred to this hospital.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 92, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 100/70 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient was an obese man who appeared weak and spoke slowly. No abdominal mass or tenderness was found, and rectal examination was negative. Neurologic examination revealed only that he was slow in giving accurate responses to questions.\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 33.5 per cent; the white-cell count was 7500, with a normal differential count. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 40 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg per 100 ml (5 mmol per liter), the glucose 86 mg per 100 ml (4.77 mmol per liter), and the thyroxine 12.2 \u03bcg per 100 ml (157 nmol per liter). The thyroid-stimulating hormone was less than 0.7 \u03bcU per milliliter. The sodium was 140 mmol, and the potassium 4.3 mmol per liter. An x-ray film of the chest was normal. An upper gastrointestinal series showed an ulcer on the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum; no mass was seen, and the duodenal bulb and loop were normal. Fiberoptic gastroscopic examination revealed thickened antral folds, without an ulcer crater; a biopsy revealed no abnormality.\nThe patient was given an ulcer diet and antacids. His appetite improved, and vomiting ceased. He was discharged on the 10th hospital day on an ulcer diet, antacid, ferrous gluconate, and thyroid, 60 mg daily.\nSecond admission\n(18 days later). Anorexia recurred. One week before admission the temperature rose to 38.3\u00b0C, and he returned to the first hospital. An x-ray film of the chest was normal, and two blood cultures were negative; ampicillin was begun. Five days before entry a headache developed, and he became confused. A lumbar puncture was performed; the cerebrospinal fluid contained 1 red cell, 132 neutrophils, and 100 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter; the protein was 365 mg, and the glucose 47 mg per 100 ml (2.6 mmol per liter); microscopical examination showed no acid-fast bacilli, bacteria or fungi, and a culture was negative. Three days before admission the dose of ampicillin was increased from 4 to 8 g daily. There was no change in the patient's status. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain, without contrast material, disclosed slight ventricular dilatation, with no evidence of a mass. A brain scan revealed no focal lesion. An electroencephalogram showed a questionable left temporoparietal lesion and bilateral slow-wave activity. On the day before entry another lumbar puncture disclosed that the cerebrospinal fluid contained 720 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 515 were neutrophils and 205 lymphocytes; the protein was 572 mg, and the glucose 47 mg per 100 ml (2.6 mmol per liter). He was transferred to this hospital.\nThe patient was married and childless. There was a family history of possible tuberculous dactylitis in an infant sibling; two other siblings died in childhood of meningitis of unknown cause. There was no personal history of cough, sputum production, sinusitis, or otitis.\nThe temperature was 37\u00b0C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 22. The blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg.\nOn examination he was somnolent, sallow, and confused. No rash, petechiae, or lymphadenopathy was observed. The neck was stiff. Abdominal examination was negative. Neurologic examination was negative except that the patient was disoriented; no papilledema was seen, and the visual fields appeared grossly normal.\nThe urine was normal; the specific gravity was 1.015. The hematocrit was 32.9 per cent; the white-cell count was 6800, with 79 per cent neutrophils. The reticulocyte count was 0.5 per cent, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 58 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 8 mg per 100 ml (2.86 mmol per liter), the glucose 114 mg per 100 ml (6.33 mmol per liter), the calcium 9.5 mg per 100 ml (2.37 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 4.9 mg per 100 ml (1.58 mmol per liter), the thyroxine 12 \u03bcg per 100 ml (154.44 nmol per liter), and the protein 6.0 g (the albumin 3.3 g, and the globulin 2.7 g) per 100 ml. The sodium was 131 mmol, the potassium 4.7 mmol, the chloride 97 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 25 mmol per liter. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. An x-ray film of the chest was unchanged. Films of the skull were normal; calcification was evident in the falx cerebri. A lumbar puncture yielded cerebrospinal fluid that contained 104 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 85 were neutrophils and 19 lymphocytes; the protein was 280 mg, and the glucose 58 mg per 100 ml (3.22 mmol per liter); microscopical examination of stained smears, including an India-ink preparation and a wet mount, disclosed no microorganisms, including acid-fast bacilli, bacteria and fungi; cytologic examination was negative for tumor cells; a specimen of the fluid was sent for culture. A serologic test for syphilis was negative.\nTwo samples of blood were obtained for culture, and penicillin and chloramphenicol were begun; thyroid hormone was witheld. The patient remained afebrile. On the second hospital day all cultures were negative. The patient was obtunded, without focal or lateralizing signs. On the following day Cheyne\u2013Stokes respirations were observed. Another lumbar puncture yielded cerebrospinal fluid that contained 700 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 600 were neutrophils and 100 lymphocytes; the protein was 410 mg, and the glucose 53 mg per 100 ml (2.94 mmol per liter); microscopical examination showed no microorganisms or polarizable material; cytologic examination was negative for tumor cells. Plastic rigidity of the extremities, muscular twitching, and nuchal rigidity were observed; phenytoin sodium was administered. Another x-ray film of the chest was normal. A CT scan of the brain (\nFig. 1\n), performed with contrast material, revealed a rounded area of increased absorption in the suprasellar region, without evidence of midline shift or mass effect; the lateral ventricles were slightly enlarged, and the fourth ventricle was not well seen; there was considerable motion artifact because of lack of cooperation by the patient. On the fourth hospital day muscular twitching persisted in the extremities. A repeated CT scan of the brain (\nFig. 1\n), performed without contrast material, again revealed a suprasellar mass but no evidence of calcification or elevated absorption values in the suprasellar region. Methylprednisolone, 240 mg daily, isoniazid, ethambutal, streptomycin, thiamine, and folic acid were instituted; penicillin and chloramphenicol were discontinued.\nOn the fifth hospital day the patient was alert, talkative, and hypomanic. On the following day the neck was supple, and speech was distinct although confused. The urinary volume rose as high as 320 ml per hour. The serum sodium was 155 mmol, and the osmolality 327 mOsm per liter. In a specimen of urine the sodium was 87 mmol, and the osmolality 306 mOsm per liter. A percutaneous selective angiographic examination showed that the right internal carotid artery was normal; the right lateral ventricle was 29.7 mm. The supraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid artery appeared straightened, and several meningeal vessels that arose from its cavernous portion were prominent. In the late arterial phase a posterior suprasellar blush was faintly seen and appeared to be supplied by meningeal vessels from the cavernous portion. The anterior choroidal artery was in a normal position, and the remaining distribution of the left internal carotid artery was normal. The left lateral ventricle was 27 mm. The distribution of the left vertebral artery was normal, and no reflux was demonstrated within the right vertebral artery. A tuberculin skin test (PPD, 5 TU) and a skin test with streptokinase-streptodornase were negative. Vasopressin tannate in oil, 0.5 ml, was administered, and the urinary volume fell to 100 ml per hour.\nOn the seventh hospital day the patient was voluble and oriented; there were no focal signs. All cultures remained negative. Another lumbar puncture yielded cerebrospinal fluid that contained 54 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 52 were lymphocytes and 2 mononuclear cells; the protein was 150 mg, and the glucose 76 mg (4.22 mmol), with a simultaneous blood glucose of 167 mg per 100 ml (9.27 mmol per liter); microscopical examination again disclosed no microorganisms. Serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a slight, diffuse increase in IgG and IgA; IgM was within normal limits. Agarose-gel electrophoresis gave a normal pattern, with a slight increase in gamma globulins. A test for antinuclear antibodies was negative. The C'H\n50\nwas 150 U, and C3 112 mg per 100 ml. On the next day the urinary volume rose to 400 ml per hour, and vasopressin was continued. On the ninth hospital day a soft-solid diet was begun by mouth; the dose of methylprednisolone was reduced to 140 mg daily and was tapered progressively.\nOn the 10th hospital day another CT scan of the brain, performed without and with contrast material, disclosed a decrease in size of the high-absorption abnormality in the suprasellar-hypothalamic region in comparison with the previous study; the ventricular size was unchanged. On the following day the patient ate and drank normally; his conversation on complex subjects was entirely coherent. Another dose of vasopressin was administered. On the 15th hospital day levothyroxine, 150 \u03bcg daily, was begun. A blood specimen, drawn before the first dose, later revealed that the total thyroxine was 1 \u03bcg (12.87 nmol per liter), and the free thyroxine 0.2 ng per 100 ml (0.003 nmol per liter); the triiodothyronine resin uptake was 36 per cent. On the 21st hospital day a specimen of blood drawn earlier revealed that the luteinizing hormone (LH) was 2 mIU, and the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 4.3 mIU per milliliter. The methylprednisolone dose was reduced to 40 mg daily. During an infusion of hydrocortisone, 100 mg by vein, a pneumoencephalographic study with polytomograms (\nFig. 2\n) revealed a soft-tissue mass in the suprasellar cistern that deformed and bulged into the inferior aspect of the third ventricle; in the lateral projection it was 20 by 18 mm, and in the anteroposterior projection 26 mm in width and 20 mm in its vertical height. The superior border of the mass was irregular in outline, with the greater portion toward the left side; the inferior border was smooth and separate from the diaphragma sellae. The mass appeared slightly mobile, bulging into the interpeduncular cistern when the patient was in the upright position but appearing in a more anterior location with the head down; no calcifications were visible within the mass. The lateral ventricles had a span of 58 mm, and the third ventricle was widened to a span of 17 mm anteriorly and 15 mm posteriorly. The cerebral sulci were not widened, and the aqueduct and the fourth ventricle were in a normal position. The cerebrospinal fluid contained 20 white cells, of which 10 were neutrophils and 10 lymphocytes; the protein was 40 mg, and the glucose 63 mg per 100 ml (3.5 mmol per liter).\nOn the 22d hospital day the patient became drowsy and incontinent of urine, and the temperature rose to 38.3\u00b0C. There was no evidence of sepsis, and the neck was not stiff. An x-ray film of the chest was unchanged. Another lumbar puncture yielded cerebrospinal fluid under a pressure of 90 mm that contained 10 red cells and 295 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 265 were neutrophils and 30 lymphocytes; the protein was 101 mg per 100 ml, and the glucose 57 mg per 100 ml (3.16 mmol per liter), with a simultaneous blood glucose of 92 mg per 100 ml (5.11 mmol per liter); microscopical examination of stained smears again showed no microorganisms. The dose of methylprednisolone was raised to 80 mg daily and held at that level. On the following day the patient was again alert and afebrile. On the 24th hospital day another CT scan of the brain, performed after the infusion of contrast material, showed residual air from the recent pneumoencephalographic study; the area of high-absorption abnormality appeared slightly smaller than on the previous study; the lateral ventricles were larger, and the fourth ventricle was of normal size.\nOn the 27th hospital day a craniotomy was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Joseph B. Martin\\*: This remarkable case can be approached by a consideration of the five salient problems that emerged during the illness, with an attempt to account for them on the basis of a single diagnosis. These problems are a recurrent meningeal inflammatory reaction, a suprasellar mass, a gastric ulcer, hypothyroidism, and diabetes insipidus. I should like first to consider the overall clinical course. The presenting symptoms of anorexia, fatigue, and dyspnea emerged rather abruptly over a few weeks in an otherwise apparently healthy 60-year-old man. The initial treatment resulted in some improvement, but a rapid decline followed, characterized by fever, headache, confusion, and cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) pleocytosis.The first issues for discussion are the nature of the meningeal signs and symptoms and the explanation for the abnormal cerebrospinal-fluid findings. The first lumbar puncture, performed five days before the second admission and two days after the initiation of treatment with ampicillin, 4 g daily, showed more than 200 white cells, most of which were neutrophils, a markedly elevated protein content, and a normal or perhaps slightly reduced glucose content. Microscopical examination and cultures for acid-fast bacilli, bacteria, and fungi were negative. Increasing the dose of ampicillin to 8 g daily three days before admission resulted in no apparent improvement. Consideration must be given initially to the possibility that the CSF findings reflected a partially treated bacterialmeningitis. Indeed, on each occasion that the spinal fluid was subsequently examined the patient was receiving antibiotics except for the last analysis, performed on the 22d hospital day.Although the initial antibiosis might have interfered with the growth of ampicillin-sensitive bacteria on culture, it became increasingly unlikely that a bacterial infection was involved as the hospital course unfolded. The second CSF sample, taken immediately before admission, showed an increase in the number of cells, principally neutrophils, with a further elevation of the protein concentration and a normal sugar content, and the third lumbar puncture, on the day of admission, showed a reduction in white cells and protein. The possibility that the patient was responding favorably to ampicillin in terms of the CSF findings was erased by the continued neurologic deterioration. The addition of penicillin and chloramphenicol to the therapeutic regimen produced no apparent improvement. The fourth CSF examination showed a considerable further increase in white cells, again predominantly neutrophils, and an increase in the protein concentration. Microscopical examination failed to show polarizable material, such as cholesterol crystals. Repeated stains and culture were negative. It was evident by this time that the disorder did not represent a partially treated bacterial meningitis of the usual types, and treatment with methylprednisolone and multiple antituberculous drugs was begun. The clinical response to this combination of drugs was dramatic. Within 48 hours the patient was alert, and by 72 hours he was fully oriented. Examination of the CSF showed 54 white cells per cubic millimeter, all lymphocytic or mononuclear, and a protein level of 150 mg per 100 ml. In my view, this response was too rapid to be accounted for by successful treatment of a tuberculous meningitis. Furthermore, the initial spinal-fluid formula, which consisted of a predominantly neutrophilic leukocytosis and a persistently normal glucose content, excludes that diagnosis, a fact that was confirmed by the failure to identify acid-fast bacilli by staining or culture. Meningovascular syphilis was ruled out by the cellular findings in the CSF, the absence of an apparent response to penicillin, and the negative serologic examination.The presence of pleocytosis in the CSF without evidence of bacteria necessitates other considerations. Parameningeal infection in the sinuses or in the epidural or subdural space is unlikely in view of the negative history of sinusitis, ear infection, or watery rhinorrhea, the neutrophilic cellular response in the CSF, and the lack of clinical response to antibacterial agents. Fungal meningitis due to cryptococcosis, candidiasis, nocardiosis, aspergillosis, or mucormycosis can be excluded by the absence of any attendant debilitating disease, by the neutrophilic rather than mononuclear cellular response, by the normal glucose level, and by the negative cultures. Meningeal or cerebral parasitic involvement seems a remote possibility because of the absence of a history of unusual foreign travel, the CSF findings, and the apparent response to steroids. Meningeal carcinomatosis and a lymphomatous or leukemic infiltration can be excluded by the lack of evidence of abnormality on cytologic examination.It is probable that the favorable clinical response can be attributed to the administration of corticosteroids. The improvement was sustained for 15 days, when a repeated lumbar puncture showed only 20 white cells and normal protein and glucose levels. On the 22d hospital day there was another acute event, with deterioration of the mental state, incontinence, and fever. A lumbar puncture showed a normal pressure, 295 white cells, almost all of which were neutrophils, a protein level of 101 mg per 100 ml, and again a normal glucose content. On the day after the dose of methylprednisolone was increased the patient appeared alert and afebrile. This course of events points to the presence of a steroid-responsive inflammatory reaction. Sarcoidosis, which can present with hypothalamic lesions and diabetes insipidus, must be considered. The CSF formula is atypical, however, since with that disorder the cellular response is usually mild and primarily lymphocytic, and the protein content is less elevated. Moreover, the sudden decline in the clinical state that occurred on the 22d hospital day despite persistent administration of steroids would be difficult to account for on the basis of sarcoidosis. Other causes of apparently aseptic meningitis, including collagen diseases and vasculitis, are unlikely in the absence of focal neurologic abnormalities and with the finding of a hypothalamic mass. Thus, the clinical state and the cerebrospinal-fluid abnormalities seem most compatible with a recurrent sterile, chemical meningitis.The neurologic evaluation of the patient during the course of the illness failed to show any evidence of focal abnormality except for signs and symptoms referable to the hypothalamus. The decreased level of consciousness and the confusion initially observed can be attributed to the meningeal inflammation, perhaps aggravated by mild hydrocephalus with dilatation of the third ventricle. The appearance of Cheyne\u2013Stokes respiration and the electroencephalographic findings point to nonspecific bihemispheric involvement. The muscular twitching suggests the possibility of seizures, which might be accounted for by extension of the meningeal inflammatory process into the cortical regions. The first clinical evidence of a hypothalamic lesion may have been the childless marriage, due to hypogonadism, but a more direct indication occurred on the sixth hospital day, when the urinary volume increased, accompanied by a rise in the serum sodium level and an increase in the serum osmolality. The increased urinary output responded promptly to vasopressin tannate, and treatment with the peptide was subsequently required to maintain water balance. These findings are diagnostic of diabetes insipidus due to vasopressin deficiency, secondary to either involvement of the supraoptic and paraventricular neurons in the hypothalamus or, more likely, to destruction of their axons in the medial basal hypothalamus. Nerve terminals of the vasopressin-secreting magnocellular neurons terminate both in the median eminence of the hypothalamus and in the neural hypophysis.[1](#core-r001) Consequently, lesions that induce diabetes insipidus must involve the hypothalamus itself since removal of the entire neural lobe alone does not damage a sufficient number of nerve terminals to cause sustained vasopressin deficiency.The endocrine evaluation of the hypothyroidism was not sufficient to permit precise localization of the site of abnormality. A goiter was not described on the general examination, and the thyroid-stimulating hormone level was reported only after replacement with thyroid hormone, when the serum thyroxine level was in the high-normal range. Under these circumstances one cannot distinguish whether the disorder resided at the thyroid, pituitary, or hypothalamic level. The degree of thyroid deficiency was marked, since the thyroxine level fell to 1 \u03bcg per 100 ml (12.87 nmol per liter) 15 days after withdrawal of replacement therapy. An elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level at the time would have documented primary thyroid failure, whereas a low TSH would have pointed toward a hypothalamic or pituitary disorder. Whether the severe degree of hypothyroidism was secondary to the hypothalamic mass is difficult to ascertain. It would be somewhat unusual, but not impossible, for destruction of thyrotropin-releasing-hormone (TRH) secretory neurons in the hypothalamus to result in such a remarkable degree of hypothyroidism. In experiments in animals extensive hypothalamic lesions have been documented to induce this degree of hypothyroidism.It is possible that the gastric ulcer was secondary to the hypothalamic lesion as a result of altered gastrointestinal secretion. Ulceration of the gastric mucosa localized to the prepyloric or antral region can be induced in the monkey by chronic electric stimulation of the hypothalamus.[2](#core-r002) The lesions that develop are large, raised, and edematous, with a gray, necrotic base. Such stimulation increases gastric acid secretion, an effect mediated primarily by vagal input, since ulceration can also be induced by direct stimulation of the vagus nerve. Brain lesions, particularly those localized in the hypothalamus, as well as other acute stressful intracranial events, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, increased intracranial pressure, or cerebral infarction, may lead to gastric-ulcer formation. The anemia was probably secondary to blood loss from the ulcer site, although tests for occult blood in the stool at the time of the second admission were negative. Endocrine tests documented low LH and FSH levels consistent with a hypothalamic lesion that interfered with luteinizing-hormone-releasing-hormone (LH-RH) stimulation of gonadotropin secretion. In a 60-year-old man one might expect elevated gonadotropin levels secondary to failure of testosterone secretion, signaling the onset of the climacteric. Other endocrine functions were not investigated. A reduced growth-hormone response to insulin hypoglycemia or levodopa would have provided evidence of hypothalamic deficiency. An elevation in prolactin would have suggested an interruption of hypothalamic secretion of prolactin-inhibiting factor. ACTH and cortisol secretory functions could not be assessed because of treatment with steroids.It would be helpful at this time to review the CT scans and angiograms before I focus specifically on the differential diagnosis of a mass in this region.Dr. Kenneth R. Davis: On the CT scan without contrast material, obtained at another hospital, the suprasellar region cannot be evaluated because of the presence of artifacts.The films of the skull show sclerosis of the floor of the sella, without enlargement, erosion or abnormal calcification. The CT scan after the intravenous injection of contrast material, obtained shortly after admission to this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)), shows homogeneous suprasellar enhancement extending into the hypothalamic region. The surrounding cisterns are compressed, and the inferior portion of the third ventricle is displaced upward. The lateral ventricles are slightly dilated. The plain scan ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows obliteration of suprasellar cisterns by an isodense mass.The angiograms reveal an avascular suprasellar mass. The pneumoencephalograms ([Fig. 2](#f002)) show a suprasellar mass in the hypothalamic region, compressing the optic and infundibular recesses of the third ventricle.Dr. Martin: The lesion demonstrated by these radiologic examinations was appropriately located in the medial basal hypothalamus to induce the endocrine abnormalities described. In the differential diagnosis an infectious process, such as a granulomatous lesion, an abscess, or a parasitic cyst, has already been excluded.A large variety of tumors may occur in this location, but only a few would be expected to give rise to a recurrent sterile meningitis. An intrasellar pituitary adenoma can be eliminated in view of the absence of appreciable radiologic abnormalities in the sella turcica. Pituitary apoplexy, which is characterized by the sudden onset of headache, visual-field restriction, and a spinal-fluid pleocytosis, occurs only with pituitary adenomas, either spontaneously or after radiation treatment. Although a suprasellar pituitary adenoma may occur without sellar changes demonstrable on plain x-ray films, the presence of hemorrhagic necrosis would have been evident on the repeated CT scans and in the form of CSF abnormalities. Other tumors that are ruled out by the normal x-ray films of the skull include a chordoma, a nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and metastatic tumors. Suprasellar arachnoid cysts usually appear translucent on the CT scan and would not be expected to give a cellular response in the cerebrospinal fluid. Neither a lipoma nor a colloid cyst of the third ventricle is compatible with the CT-scan and pneumoencephalographic findings. A lipoma would be manifested by reduced absorption, and colloid cysts arise in the roof, not the floor, of the third ventricle. Meningiomas are almost invariably evident as enhanced lesions on the CT scan, even without contrast material, and show abnormal vascularity on angiographic examination. Moreover, a meningioma would not be expected to produce a cellular CSF response, although the protein content might be elevated. A low-grade hypothalamic glioma might cause the CT enhancement described, but it would be difficult to account for the sterile meningitis without evidence of hemorrhage into the tumor, a change that would be readily demonstrable on the CT scan. The pleocytosis without abnormal cytologic findings would also be atypical for a glioma.The differential diagnosis can be narrowed to a consideration of congenital and developmental tumors, including teratoma, germinoma (or ectopic pinealoma), dermoid cyst, Rathke-cleft cyst, epidermoid cyst, and craniopharyngioma.Intracranial teratomas and ectopic pinealomas usually occur in midline locations, either in the pineal gland or in the hypothalamus. It would be very unusual for either to have failed to produce symptoms at an earlier stage, with neuroendocrine abnormalities such as growth failure, panhypopituitarism, or diabetes insipidus. Moreover, it would be difficult to account for the chemical meningeal response in the absence of cytologic abnormality. Dermoid cysts may occur in the suprasellar region, but they often contain foci of calcification and have low absorption values on the CT scan because of their fat content. The majority present much earlier in life. Rupture of a dermoid cyst with release of its contents is rare but has been reported.[3](#core-r003)Tumors that arise from embryologic cell rests or remnants of Rathke's pouch must also be considered. Evagination of the embryologic stomatodeum into the base of the skull (Rathke's pouch) is thought to give rise to the anterior pituitary gland and to the pars tuberalis; the latter is a clustering of adenohypophyseal cells that extend along the infundibulum to invest the pituitary stalk and outer zone of the median eminence. Rathke's cleft is a small slitlike cavity identifiable between the anterior and posterior divisions of the pituitary gland on careful routine examination. Cysts of Rathke's cleft can occur and may produce local pressure symptoms of hypopituitarism accompanied by sellar enlargement. On rare occasions, they extend into the suprasellar region. There is no reason to entertain that diagnosis in this case in the absence of radiologic evidence of sellar abnormality and with the observation of contrast enhancement on the CT scan.The suprasellar tumors that require detailed consideration in the case under discussion are the epidermoid cyst and craniopharyngioma. There is speculation that both arise from cellular remnants of Rathke's pouch. Both tumors are cystic, although the craniopharyngioma characteristically has a solid nodular component. The lining of the epidermoid cyst is composed of simple stratified squamous epithelium. Exfoliation of keratinous material and cholesterol crystals into the cavity produces enlargement. In cystic craniopharyngiomas the lining is indistinguishable from that of the epidermoid cyst, and laminated masses of keratin are desquamated, providing a nidus for calcification. Russell and Rubinstein[4](#core-r004) doubted that a histologic distinction should be made between the two tumors, particularly in a suprasellar location. This view was also emphasized by Petito et al.[5](#core-r005) in an extensive review of 245 case reports of craniopharyngioma obtained from the files of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Both epidermoid cysts and cystic craniopharyngiomas contain fluid that is an irritant when discharged into the subarachnoid space. Meningeal inflammation is relatively common after surgical exploration and leakage of cystic contents but is less common after their spontaneous discharge. De Klerk and Spence[6](#core-r006) described two patients with an intracranial epidermoid tumor who presented with symptoms of meningitis and sterile CSF. The CSF findings were similar to those in this case, with elevation of the protein level, a neutrophilic cellular response, and a normal or slightly reduced glucose level. A case of recurrent meningitis due to an epidermoid cyst in a 14-month-old girl was reported by Schwartz and Balentine.[7](#core-r007)Craniopharyngiomas, which account for about 3 per cent of intracranial tumors, present most often in childhood, with neuroendocrine abnormalities, visual-field deficits, papilledema, or obstructive hydrocephalus. In elderly patients, who account for up to 30 per cent of the cases, the characteristic presenting symptoms are visual-field abnormalities, headache, and dementia.[8](#core-r008) In this age group the majority of the tumors are suprasellar, and less than 50 per cent are calcified. Occurrence within the third ventricle has been described. Radiologically demonstrable changes in the sella turcica may be minor and are commonly absent. Occasionally, thickening of the sellar floor is evident, as described in this case, even though the tumor is entirely suprasellar. Endocrine disturbances may not be obvious until late in the course of the disease. Indeed, marked hypothalamic displacement may occur without appreciable hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction.There have been several case reports of spontaneous rupture of cystic craniopharyngiomas accompanied by clinical manifestations of meningitis.[8\u201310](#core-r008) In one report the clinical picture closely mimicked pituitary apoplexy.[10](#core-r010) The cerebrospinal-fluid picture is characteristically similar to that found in this case, with a polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, a high protein level, and a normal sugar level. Steroids seem to provide an effective form of treatment. Cholesterol crystals are often found in the CSF. The lack of visual-field changes in this case does not exclude a cystic craniopharyngioma, since it may occur in a posterior suprasellar and retrochiasmatic location and not impose pressure upon visual fibers in the chiasm or the optic tract.In conclusion, I think that this patient had a cystic craniopharyngioma that had been present from birth but did not produce symptoms until the recent illness evolved. Rupture of the cyst into the subarachnoid space occurred on several occasions, resulting in a chemical meningitis, which responded to the administration of steroids. The diabetes insipidus and possibly the hypothyroidism can be attributed to the hypothalamic lesion. I assume that the craniotomy was done to remove the tumor.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: Dr. Hyslop, the patient was under your care. Do you have any comments about the clinical course?Dr. Newton E. Hyslop, Jr.: The duration of the patient's prodromal symptoms was somewhat longer than is implied in the case record. For a year before admission his psychic and physical energy levels had been declining. In fact, the question of severe depression was raised on the first admission to this hospital. With respect to the nature of the hypothalamic lesion, his visual fields were normal to confrontation both preoperatively and postoperatively. Given the family history of possible childhood tuberculosis, we could not exclude a tuberculoma of the hypothalamus. The location of the lesion was consistent with that diagnosis,[11,12](#core-r011) and even the profile of the cerebrospinal fluid was compatible with the alterations produced in a tuberculin-sensitive patient when a tuberculoma ruptures into the subarachnoid space.[13](#core-r013) However, the absence of tubercle bacilli on acid-fast stains of concentrated spinal fluid made a chemical meningitis from leakage of keratin or cholesterol an attractive alternative hypothesis.[9,14](#core-r009)The relapse of the meningitis on the 22d hospital day was the consequence of reaching a critical threshold during a gradual (4 mg per day) tapering of steroid suppression of the meningeal reaction.[15,16](#core-r015) With increase of the dose of methylprednisolone from 36 to 80 mg per day his symptoms immediately disappeared. That occurrence and the lack of resolution of the mass led us to proceed with a craniotomy for diagnosis and treatment.Dr. Richardson: Dr. Fang, what was the diagnosis of the medical students?Dr. Leslie Fang: They considered a number of infectious lesions, including a tuberculoma, but concluded that the process was neoplastic. The two tumors that they favored were a meningioma and a craniopharyngioma. They were influenced by the description of a posterior suprasellar blush in the late arterial phase of the angiographic examination and concluded that the tumor was a meningioma.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Richardson: Dr. Ojemann, will you tell us your findings?Dr. Robert G. Ojemann: A right frontal temporal craniotomy was performed, and the region of the pituitary gland was explored with the aid of the operating microscope. The posterior margin of the optic chiasm and the medial edge of each optic tract were not well defined, with the entire area fused into pale, brownish-yellow tissue. A midline incision posterior to the chiasm revealed a slightly yellow, firm, encapsulated mass at a depth of 1 mm, with flecks of calcium in its wall and an envelope of gliotic tissue. A biopsy disclosed a craniopharyngioma. An internal decompression of the tumor was done initially, and then it was completely removed by careful dissection.Dr. Richardson: Dr. Kleinman will tell us about the nature of the tumor.Dr. George M. Kleinman: The tumor was composed of arborizing trabeculae of squamous epithelial cells typical of a craniopharyngioma ([Fig. 3](#f003)). No cyst was identified in the tissue submitted for examination.The craniopharyngioma accounts for only 3 per cent of intracranial tumors.[5,17\u201319](#core-r005) It may occur at any age but predominates during the first three decades,[5,18](#core-r005) with a male-to-female ratio of about 3:2.[5,18,19](#core-r005) As illustrated by the case under discussion, the characteristic microscopical appearance is one of anastomosing epithelial bands, usually with a row of palisading columnar cells at the periphery. The central cells are typically stellate and irregularly arranged, but often they are squamous, with conspicuous intercellular bridges. Squamous pearls or nodular masses of keratinized cells may be formed[5,17,20\u201322](#core-r005) ; the latter often calcify.[17](#core-r017) The tumor tends to induce an intense gliosis in the surrounding brain. The craniopharyngioma[17,20,23,24](#core-r017) shares many of the histologic features of the ameloblastoma, an odontogenic tumor of the jaw, and rarely forms a rudimentary tooth.[23](#core-r023) This similarity may reflect the ancestry of both tumors from stomatodeal ectoderm.[17,20,23](#core-r017)Craniopharyngiomas may be largely cystic or partly cystic and partly solid.[5,17,20,21](#core-r005) The cysts are filled with fluid resembling machinery oil and containing cholesterol crystals. It is capable of eliciting a severe chemical meningitis.[6,25](#core-r006) The most common association of recurrent meningitis with intracranial tumors is with epidermoid and dermoid cysts.[6,7,25](#core-r006) In such cases the meningitis is usually due to bacterial infection transmitted through a dermal sinus tract. These cysts develop from epithelial rests associated with defective closure of the neural tube, and occasionally a connection persists between the central nervous system and the skin surface.[7,26](#core-r007) Rarely, a pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma erodes into a nasal sinus, providing a portal of entry for bacterial infection.[27,28](#core-r027) Intermittent leakage of fluid with highly irritative keratinous debris from an epidermoid or dermoid cyst or a craniopharyngioma may cause recurrent aseptic chemical meningitis. This complication rarely occurs spontaneously[6,7,9,25](#core-r006) and almost always follows attempted surgical removal of the tumor.[6,7,9](#core-r006) Chronic leakage of material from an epidermoid cyst has been reported to cause progressive dementia, ataxia, extrapyramidal signs, and amyotrophy due to a chronic granulomatous arachnoiditis.[29](#core-r029)No correlation has been found between the survival of a patient with a craniopharyngioma and its histologic pattern or degree of cyst formation and the patient's age at the time of the diagnosis. However, longer survivals have been associated with an absence of calcification on plain films of the skull in adults, a tumor under 3 cm in diameter, and a normal cerebrospinal fluid.[5](#core-r005) Actuarial five-year survival rates range from 30 to 60 per cent.[5](#core-r005) In the past the results of treatment have been discouraging. Excision of the tumor was accompanied by a high operative mortality rate, with recurrence sometimes as late as 20 years after the primary excision and a poor quality of survival.[18,19](#core-r018) The epithelial trabeculae of the craniopharyngioma may burrow as much as 5 mm into the adjacent brain, eliciting a dense astrogliosis that firmly tethers the tumor to the brain.[19,22](#core-r019) This feature may prevent total removal or result in laceration of adjacent normal brain tissue during the attempt.Dr. Ojemann: The treatment of craniopharyngiomas remains a formidable challenge to the neurosurgion. Several investigators[30\u201332](#core-r030) have emphasized the importance of removing the entire tumor whenever possible. When total excision cannot be done safely, radiotherapy may be of benefit, but long-term data to support its value are not yet available. With the recent use of microsurgical techniques it has been possible to improve the outcome in these patients. For example, in a series of seven consecutive patients total removal was accomplished in six of them with no operative mortality or neurologic morbidity. The visual status was improved postoperatively in three of the patients, unchanged in two, and worse but not incapacitating in two. The ages of the seven patients ranged from 14 to 73 years. The subtotal removal was done in the 73-year-old patient, who had been having progressive loss of vision. His vision stabilized, and he remained well until he died of a coronary occlusion three years later. The other patients remain well.Dr. Richardson: Dr. Hyslop, will you tell us what happened to this patient subsequently?Dr. Hyslop: The craniotomy was performed nearly three years ago. Four months after discharge he returned to work, and he is now active in the private practice of law. He takes replacement thyroid and corticosteroid daily, pitressin injections on alternate days, and testosterone monthly. The findings on follow-up examinations of the cerebrospinal fluid and CT scans have been normal to date.\n",

      "question": "A fifty-five-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of malaise, fever and progressive generalized weakness.\nThe patient was well until five weeks before entry, when insidiously he began to feel tired, lost his appetite and noted generalized weakness. However, he continued to work until three weeks before entry, when he developed chills with fever and the weakness became worse. A doctor gave him twenty doses of aureomycin and ten injections of penicillin. The weakness increased slowly and was accompanied by tenderness of both thighs. The temperature continued elevated, running from 100 to 102\u00b0F. Ten days before admission he began to vomit and had some diarrhea, both of which persisted. Four days before entry he became afebrile, and the penicillin was discontinued. Two days later because of persistent vomiting he was given several doses of tincture of belladonna, and a maculopapular rash appeared on the neck, face, chest and trunk. Despite increasing weakness he was able to walk with assistance until the morning of admission, when suddenly he could barely move his legs.\nThe past and family histories were irrelevant.\nPhysical examination revealed an acutely ill man with frequent hiccuping. The skin was very dry, with a maculopapular rash and a few pustules on the face, neck and trunk. The conjunctivas were injected, and the fundi clear. The tongue was parched, and there was bleeding of the palate. The pharynx was dry and injected, without exudate. The lungs were clear. The heart was not enlarged. The sounds were distant; there was sinus rhythm at a rate of 88, with a Grade I apical systolic murmur. The abdomen was soft, with no masses or tenderness. Rectal examination was negative. Neurologic examination revealed profound generalized weakness. The cranial nerves were intact, and no sensory changes were found. The ankle and knee jerks were absent, and the biceps and triceps hypoactive.\nThe temperature was 100\u00b0F., the pulse 90, and the respirations 22. The blood pressure was 140 systolic, 90 diastolic.\nExamination of the blood disclosed a white-cell count of 17,700, with 78 per cent neutrophils. The nonprotein nitrogen was 310 mg., the total protein 3.5 gm., the fasting blood sugar 207 mg., the phosphorus 19.9 mg. and the calcium 8.1 mg. per 100 cc., and the sodium 135.6 milliequiv., the chloride 97 milliequiv., and the potassium 10.1 milliequiv. per liter. A blood culture was negative. An x-ray film of the chest was not remarkable. An electrocardiogram (\nFig. 1\nA\n) showed a normal rhythm, with a PR interval of 0.32 second. The QRS complexes were wide, with a duration of 0.14 second and bizarre configuration. The T waves were high and peaked and ST segment depressed in Leads V\n2\nthrough V\n6\n. The electrocardiogram was considered consistent with potassium intoxication. A lumbar puncture taken just after admission revealed a clear colorless fluid under an initial pressure equivalent to 140 mm. of water and a final pressure equivalent to 80 mm. of water. The spinal fluid contained 4 red cells per cubic millimeter. The gold-sol and Wassermann tests were negative.\nOn admission the patient was given 5 per cent dextrose in physiologic saline solution intravenously. After receiving 700 cc. he recovered muscular function, and the reflexes were normal. During the next twenty-four hours he received 5500 cc. of 5 per cent dextrose in physiologic saline solution. However, he continued to be markedly dehydrated, vomited moderate amounts of bile-stained fluid and passed no urine. On the second hospital day he appeared drowsy, and the rash became more extensive. Physical examination was essentially unchanged except for hypoactive reflexes. Trousseau and Chvostek signs were negative. The nonprotein nitrogen was 340 mg., and the fasting blood sugar 207 mg. per 100 cc., and the potassium 8.7 milliequiv., the chloride 103 milliequiv., and the carbon dioxide 10.1 milliequiv. per liter. The electrocardiogram (\nFig. 1\nB\n) was almost normal, with normal PR intervals and QRS complexes. The T waves were low in Leads 1 and AVL and normal in the other leads. The hemoglobin was 9.5 gm. per 100 cc., and the white-cell count was 12,500. A cystoscopic examination was performed, with catheterization of the left ureter; aspiration yielded a white, milky material followed by 10 cc. of urine, which contained many red cells, white cells and casts. The retrograde pyelogram showed a normal left kidney. The right ureter could not be catheterized because of movement of the patient. Because of the persistent anuria, he was put on the artificial kidney, with a blood flow averaging 300 cc. per minute. At the beginning of the procedure the nonprotein nitrogen was 220 mg., the uric acid 10.5 mg., the creatinine 29.2 mg., and the blood urea nitrogen 153 mg. per 100 cc., and the carbon dioxide 8.3 milliequiv., the sodium 139.5 milliequiv., the chloride 107 milliequiv., and the potassium 8.3 milliequiv. per liter. During the procedure he became unresponsive and had a slight hypertensive effect. The dialysis was continued for six hours. After dialysis, the nonprotein nitrogen was 160 mg., and the blood urea nitrogen 147 mg. per 100 cc., and the carbon dioxide 13.4 milliequiv., the sodium 146.6 milliequiv., the chloride 113 milliequiv., and the potassium 4.5 milliequiv. per liter. Shortly thereafter he developed marked laryngeal stridor requiring intubation, which established a good airway. Gradually he lapsed into deep coma and died sixty hours after admission.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Charles L. Short\\*: We might look at the x-ray films first, Dr. Wyman.Dr. Stanley M. Wyman: The chest and heart are not remarkable. The films taken from the retrograde pyelogram show a normal-appearing left kidney, with normal calyxes and pelvis. The right kidney is poorly outlined but appears within normal limits in size and shape.Dr. Short: There is not even a suggestion of a filling defect in the calyxes?Dr. Wyman: Not that I can see.Dr. Short: The chest shows no signs of a healed infection or pneumonia?Dr. Wyman: I do not see anything to suggest any previous trouble.Dr. Short: The story is essentially that of a febrile illness that came on insidiously and gave no real localizing features except possibly the vomiting, the diarrhea and the tenderness of the thighs. The febrile phase was apparently subsiding, perhaps in response to antibiotics, shortly before admission. Simultaneously, the patient became much sicker and was found on admission to be in extreme renal failure, with anuria. At this time two features of potassium intoxication were apparent \u2014 namely, the severe muscular weakness and the electrocardiographic changes. The potassium intoxication responded rapidly to intravenous administration of saline solution and glucose, but otherwise the patient failed to respond to treatment, which included a run with the artificial kidney. This was quite effective as far as the blood flow and the improvement in the blood chemical findings were concerned.I think the first point we have to decide in this patient is whether the whole illness, including the terminal uremia, represented one disease or whether he died from renal failure secondary either to the febrile disease or to the treatment that was employed. I can think of only two or perhaps three febrile diseases that commonly terminate in renal failure with anuria. The first is Weil's disease. One usually thinks of this condition as a form of hepatitis, but severe renal involvement is frequent and death may ensue from uremia. This diagnosis was suggested to me by the tenderness of the thighs, since muscle tenderness may be one of the most distressing features of this condition, surpassing that which is found in trichinosis. The injection of the conjunctivas and the rash are consistent with this diagnosis. I believe, however, that the absence of jaundice or of liver enlargement is sufficient to exclude Weil's disease in this patient. It is true that in many cases of Weil's disease, jaundice or signs pointing toward hepatitis may be entirely absent, but death in theabsence of jaundice is certainly extremely rare.The second febrile illness that may end in uremia is the severe form of pyelonephritis, which occurs more commonly in diabetes, usually called necrotizing renal papillitis. There is a record in this case of two fasting blood sugar determinations of over 200 mg. per 100 cc. That is fairly good evidence for diabetes. Necrotizing renal papillitis may come on insidiously, without localizing signs, and the diagnosis is often made only at autopsy unless the possibility is thought of in life. This usually appears in nondiabetic patients only with urinary obstruction, for which there was no real evidence in the case under discussion. There are two points against this diagnosis; the first is the disappearance of fever before admission, and probably much more important the normal retrograde pyelogram, at least of the left kidney. Since in fatal cases the process is usually bilateral, I think we have to discard this diagnosis. On the other hand, if Dr. Wyman had shown us irregular filling defects of the renal calyxes, I think I could have made the diagnosis with some assurance.The third febrile illness that may terminate in this way is periarteritis nodosa in a rather acute fulminating form. There were no helpful diagnostic points that I can discover that would enable one to make a diagnosis of a primary or idiopathic periarteritis nodosa to explain the whole illness.In going over the history it seemed to me more likely that the renal failure was secondary and not actually a part of the patient's disease for which he was given antibiotics. The history gives no clue to the original disease, although presumably it was an infection that had apparently responded to therapy. The vomiting and the diarrhea might have resulted from the aureomycin, although we are not told the exact time when this drug was administered. The question might be raised here of extrarenal azotemia secondary to vomiting and diarrhea. I do not believe that this is likely as the sole explanation of the renal failure unless he had pre-existing renal disease. Pre-existing Bright's disease is not suggested by the history although the low serum protein brings up the possibility of a chronic glomerulonephritis. The normal blood pressure, the lack of eyeground changes and the anuria are all against a terminal stage of glomerulonephritis.I think it is more likely that this patient suffered a catastrophic insult to the kidneys in the form of lower-nephron nephrosis or cortical necrosis. None of the known causes of lower-nephron nephrosis have been recorded in this case \u2014 shock, intravascular hemolysis or sulfonamide intoxication. I know of no evidence that toxicity from antibiotics such as penicillin or aureomycin may be responsible. He may have had a certain degree of shock from the vomiting and diarrhea, but I am reluctant to make this diagnosis without adequate causative factors. The most reasonable explanation of this man's death from renal failure would seem to lie in a severe reaction to one of the antibiotics given, with hypersensitivity as the probable mechanism. It is well known that allergic manifestations in the form of rashes have been recorded after aureomycin. The development of a rash in this patient and the renal failure occurring after the apparent subsidence of the original infection are the most important clues to the diagnosis that I wish to present \u2014 namely, hypersensitivity to penicillin or aureomycin, with vascular lesions resembling periarteritis nodosa and cortical necrosis of the kidney. I am reminded here of a patient\\* discussed at one of these conferences several years ago who died in severe renal failure consequent to sulfonamide toxicity and who showed at autopsy the findings I have just mentioned.Dr. James J. Currens: I think it might be of some interest to know that the requisition for the electrocardiogram raised the question of low potassium because of the muscular weakness and paralysis, and the electrocardiographic evidence was really the first indication of serious potassium intoxication. That there was a rather dramatic change in the electrocardiograms ([Fig. 1](#f001)) within about eighteen hours after 2 or 3 liters of fluid had been administered, is important, I think, particularly since the serum potassium changed very little \u2014 from about 10 to almost 9 milliequiv. per liter. This helps corroborate the evidence that we are collecting that there is no correlation between serum potassium levels and electrocardiographic changes. Also, the serum sodium was essentially the same on these two occasions so that the ratio of sodium to potassium was again about the same. It raises the question, which is as yet unanswered, whether intracellular potassium, particularly in the conduction system, is the important factor in this regard.Dr. Lloyd H. Smith, Jr.: As the patient died six hours after being on the artificial kidney, I might make a brief comment about the procedure. It was a very satisfactory dialysis lasting about six hours; in fact, it was the most satisfactory dialysis from a technical standpoint that we have ever had. The bath with which he was dialyzed was modified in one important way. Because of the very high serum potassium level we omitted potassium from the dialyzing fluid. We thought the results would be correspondingly good and were very surprised and disappointed that he died in such a mysterious fashion soon after the dialysis.Dr. Richard Goldsmith: Regarding what Dr. Currens said, I wonder if it might be assumed, in a man who was given 5500 cc. of fluids intravenously, that there was a release of potassium from the cells to the blood that kept up the serum potassium concentration?Dr. Marian Ropes: At the time of admission this patient presented a very confusing picture. Clinically, there was little to suggest renal failure. He was extremely clear mentally. We ascribed the anuria, which was apparent a few hours following admission, to the extreme dehydration. We believed that he had an infectious disease resulting in this condition of almost complete paralysis and of heart block. However, it soon became apparent that he really was in renal failure. We had then no explanation for the underlying renal disease.Dr. John W. Littlefield: I should like to know if anybody knows what happens to the potassium in renal azotemia? Is that a differential point? Is there evidence of potassium intoxication just from dehydration?Dr. Currens: I think some of the changes that have been reported in Addison's disease are probably of that nature in which the renal function is quite poor probably as a result of the electrolyte imbalance of the serum. There may be retention of the potassium to the point that it tends to produce the electrocardiographic evidence of potassium intoxication. That is the only one that I can think of just now.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Tracy B. Mallory: Autopsy showed two important findings. The first was the kidneys, which were very much enlarged, weighing 500 gm., and showed smooth, pale surfaces dotted with petechial hemorrhages \u2014 a gross picture that was quite characteristic of an acute diffuse glomerulonephritis. Microscopical sections confirmed that. Every glomerulus was involved, with both capillary obliteration and marked formation of epithelial crescents. There were just a few minute old scars of vascular lesions in the kidney, but I do not think that there had been any significant degree of chronic glomerulonephritis antedating this attack. The reason why the patient died so shortly after the period of dialysis was explained when the head was examined, revealing a very large cerebral hemorrhage, which Dr. Richardson can describe for us.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: When the brain was examined, it was apparent from the flattening of the convolutions of the right hemisphere, and also by evidence of herniation of the medial aspect of the right temporal lobe through the opening of the tentorium, that there was a large mass within the right hemisphere. On section of the brain we found a very large cerebral hemorrhage within the right hemisphere ([Fig. 2](#f002)). The blood within it was fresh, and it could not have been of any long duration. It assuredly was the cause of death in this case. In addition scattered throughout the midbrain and pons were multiple hemorrhages. Hemorrhages of that type are seen in cases of increased intracranial pressure and frequently are associated with temporal herniation such as we found in this case. They were secondary to the large space-taking mass within the cerebral hemisphere, and they probably resulted in the very rapid demise.Dr. Alfred E. Kranes: Would it be proper to ask Dr. Smith whether the heparin used here might have been responsible for this?Dr. Smith: I think it might have been. We give large doses of heparin to all these patients. This represents a calculated risk in these severely ill patients, who may have hypertension and diffuse vascular disease. Although this represents the first serious complication of the procedure in our 12 patients to date, it illustrates that vividialysis is still more than an elective procedure.Dr. Currens: Of course, it was not known what the diagnosis was here, but the group at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital have been reluctant to dialyze patients with acute glomerulonephritis.Dr. Smith: But they have done so in a number of cases when there has been an emergency. We have treated a few cases, without complications.A Physician: In that connection I might just point out that had the patient not been dialyzed I think there is no doubt that he would also have died.Dr. Short: Do you think he had an original infection with glomerulonephritis secondary to that, or do you think that the whole picture is explained on the basis of kidney disease?Dr. Mallory: It is very difficult to estimate the duration of an acute glomerulonephritis. This looked as if it might have been present for a period of six to ten weeks.Dr. Short: It is certainly a very unusual story for a glomerulonephritis, especially in view of the absence of edema. I do not know whether the urine was ever examined before the patient came into the hospital.Dr. Mallory: There was a fair amount of tissue edema at the time of autopsy. The subcutaneous tissues were quite wet. There was a small amount of fluid in the various body cavities.Dr. Ropes: And that was due probably to the very large amount of fluid given him during that period.Dr. F. Dennette Adams: What was the nature of the milky fluid that was returned by the cystoscope?Dr. Mallory: I would think it was urine, with sediment of some sort.Dr. Currens: That it was followed by urine with a good many red cells gave us the impression that two different types of liquid were present.Dr. Ropes: We thought it was desiccated material, which when freed released a very small amount of urine behind it. There was a definite difference in the two materials.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Jenny Linnoila\n(Neurology): An 11-month-old girl was seen in the outpatient neurology clinic because of developmental delay.\nThe patient was born at another hospital by vaginal delivery after induction of labor at 38 weeks' gestation because of oligohydramnios. The mother had received prenatal care, including obstetrical ultrasonographic testing, the results of which were reportedly normal. Serologic screening tests during pregnancy were reportedly negative. The prenatal course was uncomplicated. The mother took ondansetron for nausea and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and reported that there had been less fetal movement in utero as compared with her previous pregnancy. No meconium was present at delivery. The birth weight was 3.0 kg (25th percentile), the length 48.3 cm (25th percentile), and the head circumference 32.5 cm (10th percentile); the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were both 9. The newborn was admitted to the neonatal nursery. The results of newborn auditory screening were reportedly normal. Tests performed at the New England Newborn Screening Program were negative. She was discharged home on the third day of life. She reportedly fed well and developed and grew normally. She smiled, laughed, and interacted socially, but she vocalized little. At approximately 4 months of age, the infant's parents noted that she startled in response to loud sounds. At 6 months of age, she began rolling over from her stomach to her back and vice versa, reaching out for objects, and sitting with assistance. Her length was 69.9 cm (96th percentile), her head circumference 43 cm (72nd percentile), and her weight 8.5 kg (89th percentile). By 9 months, she could grasp objects and feed herself; however, her pediatrician noted that she sat only in the tripod position (back bent slightly forward, and arms placed forward with the hands near the feet). Two months later, her parents reported that she sat only briefly and then flopped over and that she had stopped reaching for objects and feeding herself. At age 11.5 months, she was referred to the neurology outpatient clinic at this hospital.\nThe infant's parents reported that she often appeared tired and less alert than she had earlier in her life. She did not crawl or pull to stand. She consumed dairy-based infant formula and soft baby foods and had maintained expected trajectories on the developmental curves for height, weight, and head circumference. She smiled, made good eye contact, and responded to her name. She drooled frequently and made occasional mouthing movements. She did not choke or have trouble swallowing, she did not have constipation, and she did not have activity suggestive of seizures. She had had an ear infection at 4 months of age. Immunizations were current. She lived with her parents and her brother (3.5 years of age), who were well. Her mother was of Russian Jewish ancestry and her father of Irish and Italian ancestry. Her mother was gravida 4, para 2, spontaneous abortion 2. The family had traveled to the Caribbean and Italy. A paternal cousin had a mild speech problem; there were no other known neurologic conditions in the family.\nOn examination, the infant's facial features were nondysmorphic. The head circumference was 45 cm (50th percentile); the anterior fontanel was soft. Funduscopic examination was unsuccessful. There were two hypopigmented spots on her left thigh; examination with a Wood's lamp was negative, revealing no evidence of neurocutaneous lesions. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. On neurologic examination, she was subdued, appeared alert, and intermittently startled spontaneously. Pupillary reactions were normal, and ocular movements were full and conjugate, with horizontal and vertical eye movements that tracked the examiner's face, bright objects, and light, without saccadic intrusions or nystagmus. Movements of the infant's face and palate were symmetric. There were no tongue fasciculations or macroglossia. She smiled periodically, made brief chewing movements, puckered her lips, and drooled, but she did not vocalize. She turned her head to a bell ring. She opened her hands and moved her fingers. Her legs were extended tonically, with bilateral equinus foot posture (plantar flexion) and curled toes. When pulled to a standing position, she rose onto her toes. Muscle tone was increased, with rigidity; the heel cords were tight. The plantar reflexes were extensor; grasp and Moro reflexes were absent. A few unsustained beats of ankle clonus were present. In the prone position, she lifted her head briefly. Her head and neck drooped anteriorly when sitting. The asymmetric tonic neck reflex was incomplete. On testing of the parachute reflex (abduction of arms, extension of elbows and wrists, and spreading of fingers, elicited when an infant is held in suspension in the ventral position and is tilted abruptly forward toward the floor), she fisted both hands and did not spread her arms.\nThe blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 159 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 80). Other test results, including blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine kinase, were normal, as were a complete panel of plasma amino acids and urinary levels of organic acids. An electroencephalogram showed the absence of sleep spindles during a relatively prolonged stage N2 sleep (a stage of non\u2013rapid-eye-movement sleep characterized by sleep spindles), infrequent low-amplitude spikes in both centroparietal regions during sleep stage N2 (of uncertain clinical significance), and no electrographic or electroclinical features of seizures.\nDr. Otto Rapalino:\nSeven days after initial evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed without the administration of gadolinium (\nFigure 1\n). The image showed mild diffuse hypomyelination that was most conspicuous in the deep and subcortical supratentorial white matter, with relative sparing of the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. T\n2\n-weighted images of the posterior thalami and lentiform nuclei showed a subtle increase in signal. The anterior thalami appeared mildly hyperintense on T\n1\n-weighted images and hypointense on T\n2\n-weighted images. Single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the left frontal white matter revealed a slight decrease in the\nN\n-acetylaspartate-to-creatine ratio; the metabolite ratios were normal on MRS of the region of the left basal ganglia.\nDr. Linnoila:\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Kalpathy S. Krishnamoorthy:* I performed a neurologic evaluation of this infant when she was 11 months of age. Perinatal history was unremarkable, and there apparently had been no cause for concern during the first 6 months of life; concern about her development was raised when she was between 8 months and 11 months of age. She was nondysmorphic, with normal head growth. The motor examination was abnormal owing to increased muscle tone. Her vision appeared intact, but the fundi could not be evaluated. Developmentally, the patient had the skills of a 6-month-old infant. She had frequent startle responses, which were not of particular concern to the parents but were clinically relevant for the formulation of the diagnosis. We based the differential diagnosis on the clinical concerns and neurologic findings.The first concern was the girl's developmental delay. Such a delay can be due to a nonprogressive (static) or a progressive (degenerative) neurologic disorder. In general, infants with nonprogressive disorders show signs of developmental delay but maintain their trajectory on the developmental curve; infants with progressive neurologic disorders reach a plateau and then lose their developmental skills. An overlap between progressive and nonprogressive neurologic disorders might make it difficult to distinguish between the two entities, and often the passage of time and careful follow-up evaluations are helpful. Developmental delay occurs in approximately 1 to 3% of children and can be isolated or global. A cause can be determined in 50 to 60% of cases; the most common causes of developmental delays are perinatal insults, chromosomal disorders, brain malformations, toxins, and autistic-spectrum disorders.[1,2](#core-r001) Metabolic disorders constitute only 1 to 3% of developmental delays.[3](#core-r003) At the time of this patient's initial presentation, it was not entirely clear whether her development was continuing its trajectory or had reached a plateau and started to regress.The second concern was the infant's marked increase in muscle tone due to spasticity and rigidity. The Babinski sign was present bilaterally. These abnormalities localize to lesions in the motor pathways of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, central white matter, or brain stem and indicate bilateral corticospinal dysfunction. The significance of extensor plantar responses (Babinski sign) in newborns and young infants is an enigma. In clinical studies, 92 to 93% of healthy neonates had flexor plantar responses.[4,5](#core-r004) In general, extensor plantar responses in infancy should be interpreted in the context of other associated findings, such as asymmetry, hyperreflexia, and clonus.\n### Nonprogressive Causes of Developmental Delay and Spasticity\n\nThe first diagnostic consideration was whether the developmental delay and spasticity were due to a nonprogressive disorder, such as cerebral palsy, a controversial term that includes motor-impairment syndromes caused by lesions in the brain in the early stages of development.[6](#core-r006) The classification of spastic cerebral palsy, the common subtype, is made according to the topography of the lesions; the topography varies depending on whether the cause is spastic diplegia (e.g., cystic periventricular leukomalacia), spastic quadriplegia (e.g., hypoxic\u2013ischemic injury), or spastic hemiplegia (e.g., perinatal stroke and malformations).[7](#core-r007) Causes of cerebral palsy are prenatal (60% of cases), perinatal (15 to 20%), or postnatal (10%).[6](#core-r006) Both chorioamnionitis and fetal thrombotic vasculopathy have been implicated as causes of cerebral palsy.[8,9](#core-r008) In one study, 70 to 90% of cases of cerebral palsy were associated with abnormal MRI scans.[7](#core-r007) In another study, predominant abnormalities associated with cerebral palsy included white-matter lesions on MRI in 43% of cases, although in 12% of cases, the MRI scans were normal.[10](#core-r010)The practice parameters of the American Academy of Neurology recommend neuroimaging with MRI as the initial diagnostic test for evaluation of both cerebral palsy and global developmental delay.[11,12](#core-r011) Dr. Rapalino, would you discuss the differential diagnosis of the MRI findings?*Dr. Rapalino:* The differential diagnosis of the MRI findings in the thalami includes inherited metabolic disorders, such as GM1 or GM2 gangliosidosis[13\u201315](#core-r013) and Krabbe's disease,[15](#core-r015) disorders caused by previous hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy,[16](#core-r016) infectious processes (e.g., encephalitis associated with influenza A [H1N1] virus infection),[17](#core-r017) and encephalopathy caused by hypoglycemia.[16,18](#core-r016)The MRI findings in the brain in patients with gangliosidosis include T2-weighted hypointense and T1-weighted hyperintense changes in the ventral thalami, increased T2-weighted signal in the nuclei in the basal ganglia, and white-matter hypomyelination.[15,19,20](#core-r015) The infantile forms of GM1 and GM2 gangliosidoses are very difficult to differentiate on the basis of the findings on MRI. Infants with Krabbe's disease may have changes on MRI that are similar to the changes seen in infants with GM1 or GM2 gangliosidosis, but in cases of Krabbe's disease, the thalami and basal ganglia are less involved and the corpus callosum is frequently affected.[15](#core-r015) Although in this patient the findings in the deep gray matter on MRI might be caused by previous hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy, viral encephalitis, or hypoglycemic encephalopathy, the clinical presentation argues against these causes.*Dr. Krishnamoorthy:* This patient's normal early development and the findings on MRI did not favor a static disorder such as cerebral palsy. A number of genetic and neurometabolic disorders can mimic cerebral palsy ([Table 1](#t01)),[21](#core-r021) but this patient did not have the typical features of these disorders and thus including them in the differential diagnosis was not warranted.\n### Metabolic and Degenerative Disorders\n\nThe second diagnostic consideration was whether the patient had a metabolic or degenerative disorder, with devastating consequences to her developing brain. Clinical suspicion for such disorders is often heralded by red flags, such as failure to thrive, intermittent encephalopathy, loss of normal milestones, consanguinity, seizures, movement disorders, vision or hearing impairment, excessive irritability or startle response, cognitive decline, and development of spasticity, some of which were noted in this patient. Clinical recognition of these disorders may be aided by physical findings on examination ([Table 2](#t02)).[22](#core-r022) Age at the onset of various metabolic and degenerative disorders differs. Most amino acid and organic acid disorders, urea-cycle disorders, and peroxisomal disorders are manifested in the neonatal period. Disorders that become apparent in early and late infancy include lysosomal storage disorders (e.g., Tay\u2013Sachs disease, Krabbe's disease, Canavan's disease, and metachromatic leukodystrophy), mitochondrial disorders (e.g., Leigh's disease), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) deficiency, and congenital glycosylation disorders. This patient's normal early development, followed by developmental regression and the emergence of spasticity, led to a strong suspicion of lysosomal disorders. Clinical recognition of a lysosomal disorder may be facilitated by such features as dysmorphism, skeletal changes, and visceromegaly ([Table 2](#t02)); none of these findings were present in this patient. Retinal findings, such as cherry-red spots and optic atrophy, could also be diagnostic, but an eye examination after pupillary dilatation was not performed in this patient.\n### Startle Responses\n\nA unique feature of this patient's clinical presentation was frequent startle responses, which were exaggerated by sound stimuli. An exaggerated startle response in infancy is a characteristic feature of hyperekplexia (startle disease), but this patient's other clinical features were not typical of this disorder.[23](#core-r023) Myoclonic seizures may appear similar to startle responses in cases of myoclonic epilepsy, infantile spasms, childhood hypoxic brain injury, and a number of neurodegenerative disorders. Among the lysosomal disorders, a characteristic startle response occurs in infants with Tay\u2013Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis or hexosaminidase A deficiency). In 1887, Bernard Sachs wrote, \u201cHearing seemed to be very acute, there was unusual hyperexcitability to auditory and tactile impressions; the slightest touch and every sound were apt to startle the child.\u201d[24](#core-r024) Clinically, these startle responses appear spontaneously or as an extension response triggered by auditory stimuli (hyperacusis) and often begin before a patient is 4 months of age.[25](#core-r025) This patient's remarkable startle episodes were an affirmation and an important diagnostic clue for Tay\u2013Sachs disease.\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, I favored the diagnosis of Tay\u2013Sachs disease because of the striking startle response in an infant with developmental regression and emerging spasticity. The diagnostic test was analysis of blood lysosomal enzymes.\n\nDiagnostic Testing and Discussion of Management\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n*Dr. Florian Eichler:* A lysosomal-enzyme screen, performed at the Lysosomal Diseases Testing Laboratory at Jefferson Medical College, in Philadelphia, revealed very low leukocyte hexosaminidase A activity (3.2%; normal range, >50.0%); other enzyme levels were within the normal range. This result is consistent with Tay\u2013Sachs disease.Genetic testing was performed at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, to confirm the diagnosis. This patient had one copy of a mutation in the hexosaminidase A gene (*HEXA*), which is commonly seen in infantile Tay\u2013Sachs disease (c.1278insTATC), as well as a frameshift mutation in exon 11, which is the most common mutated allele seen in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. She also had one copy of a mutation that resulted in a premature stop codon (c.409C\u2192T). Both mutations inactivate the enzyme and have previously been detected in patients with an infantile Tay\u2013Sachs disease phenotype. Other mutations may allow for more enzyme activity and result in a milder phenotype.Owing to the success of screening and the increase in intermarriage rates in the Jewish population, the disease is no longer consigned solely to the Jewish population. This patient, with her mixed ethnic background, reflects this trend.[26,27](#core-r026) The more diverse genetic admixture has decreased the sensitivity of DNA screening alone. In this family, screening had not been performed, but DNA screening alone would have given false reassurance concerning the father. Currently, enzymatic analysis is recommended as the primary screening method. DNA testing should be used to confirm results, identify cases of pseudodeficiency, and provide information for genetic counseling.The lack of hexosaminidase A in persons with Tay\u2013Sachs disease impairs degradation of the ganglioside GM2, leading to excessive storage in neurons. In infancy, normal myelin development is also impaired. This leads to progressive weakness and loss of motor skills in the first year of life. Only one half of the patients learn to sit independently, and those that acquire this ability, such as this patient, lose it within 1 year. Early excessive startle was a pathognomonic sign. Once the diagnosis of Tay\u2013Sachs disease was made in this case, pupillary dilatation to assess for a cherry-red spot was deferred.The median survival among infants with Tay\u2013Sachs disease is 47 months, and no treatment, including bone marrow transplantation, has been shown to favorably alter the natural history of the disease.[28](#core-r028) Symptomatic management with anticonvulsant and antispasmodic agents remains the mainstay of treatment. In this patient, muscle spasms and seizures developed over time, and sleep and respiratory difficulties worsened as the disease progressed.We encountered enormous need for palliative care. Children with Tay\u2013Sachs disease benefit from early access to palliative care specialists, as do children with other chronic life-threatening conditions.[29](#core-r029) The family decided not to have a gastric tube placed in the patient. Even with frequent home visits and hospice support, the patient's clinical course was protracted and, at times, painful for the family to witness.The psychosocial needs of families with Tay\u2013Sachs disease continue even after medical decision making has taken place. In this case, the suffering extended to parents, caregivers, and siblings alike. Of particular distress to the observers was the patient's excessive startle response, which is characteristic of this disorder. Even with attentive palliative care, effective overall management was challenging and often incomplete, serving as a reminder that some symptoms have no easy remedies. The patient died at 28 months of age. An autopsy was performed.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. Matthew P. Frosch:* At the time of her death, the patient's weight was 8.2 kg (<5th percentile), and the height 87 cm (approximately 50th percentile). There was evidence of bacterial pneumonia in both lungs, with postmortem cultures growing both *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae*. No other pathological changes were noted in the general autopsy findings.The brain weighed 1238 g, which was slightly heavier than expected for the patient's age, and had a normal gyral pattern and a decreased volume of the cerebellum and the corpus callosum as compared with other regions. The brain was extremely firm in the fresh state, and this firmness persisted after fixation. In the fresh state, moderate abnormality was evident in the appearance of the cerebral cortex, which had a pinkish, hyperemic appearance; a portion of the white matter had a similar change in appearance ([Figure 2A and 2B](#f02)). The overall organization of the brain, with cortical and subcortical structures, was normal.Microscopic examination of the cerebral cortex and all other gray-matter regions showed that the neurons were markedly abnormal, with accumulation of large amounts of cytoplasmic material that stained intensely with Luxol fast blue ([Figure 2D](#f02)). Markedly reactive astrocytes were intermixed with the neurons that were filled with storage material. In most brain regions, there was no evidence of similar storage material in the reactive astrocytes. A diffuse cortical gliosis was present, and some reactive astrocytes were in close apposition to engorged neurons ([Figure 2G](#f02)).Within the subcortical white matter, there was a marked loss of myelinated fibers, as well as an extremely brisk reactive astrocytosis. There was no evidence of perivascular accumulation of cells containing storage material, and there was minimal evidence of storage material in the cytoplasm of the reactive astrocytes.On gross examination of the more posterior portions of the cerebral hemispheres, there was evidence of splitting of the cerebral cortex in the deeper layers ([Figure 2B](#f02)). Microscopic examination of these regions showed pervasive neuronal accumulation of storage material. In the upper cortical layers, there was preservation of the overall texture of the neuropil, despite the neuronal distention and the reactive gliosis. In the deeper layers, however, there was neuronal dropout and the appearance of storage material, stained with Luxol fast blue, in the reactive astrocytes. This suggests that the more advanced lesions in the disease are associated with neuronal death and that, as a result, there is accumulation of the storage material in astrocytes.The spinal cord was markedly involved by the process, with storage material in neurons of the dorsal horn, of Clarke's column, and of the anterior horn ([Figure 2F](#f02)). There was marked pallor of the descending corticospinal tracts but relatively intact ascending fibers of the dorsal columns, suggesting that there was markedly less involvement of peripheral neurons ([Figure 2C](#f02)). The cerebellum was markedly atrophic, with poor discrimination of gray and white matter on gross examination. Microscopically, there was neuronal accumulation of storage material in all the neuronal populations, including Purkinje cells, granule cells, and stellate cells. Accumulated material was also evident in the dendritic arbors of the Purkinje cells ([Figure 2E](#f02)).Electron microscopy of the cerebral cortex and other brain regions revealed that, despite the overall poor preservation of neuronal structure, there was evidence of storage material with numerous concentric membranous lamellar bodies ([Figure 2H](#f02)). There was no evidence of similar storage material in either cardiac myocytes or hepatocytes.Overall, the gross, microscopic, and ultrastructural findings in this case are consistent with a neuronal storage disease. Although the morphologic characteristics are not specific, they are fully consistent with the genetically determined diagnosis of GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay\u2013Sachs disease).*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): The patient's pediatrician is here today. Would you comment on your care of this patient?*Dr. Roger Spingarn* (Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital and Newton\u2013Wellesley Hospital, Newton, MA): This was an intensely difficult case for me as a pediatrician. Moving from the usual standard of helping a child overcome a disease to a palliative model required a leap uncommonly encountered in pediatrics. We are unaccustomed to helping a child die; here, we wanted to do so in a manner that provided dignity to the patient and honored the family's wishes. I think they taught me more than I taught them. Caring for this lovely child and her family was a genuine honor. Care was provided during the patient's visits to her pediatrician's office and during home visits by a hospice physician, members of the hospital palliative care team, her neurologist, and her pediatrician. The patient never went to the emergency department and never needed in-patient care. The hospice physician was present daily or every other day during the final few weeks to help manage the patient's pain and autonomic storming (i.e., hypertension, dyspnea, intermittent agitation, dystonia, and disorientation).*Dr. Harris:* Are there questions for our discussants?*Dr. Drucilla J. Roberts* (Pathology): Was the placenta examined pathologically? Most such pregnancies will have some abnormalities, most commonly (in my experience) decreased fetal activity and mild fetal growth restriction, either of which should stimulate a pathological investigation of the placenta. Most lysosomal storage diseases have diagnostic placental pathological features, although in the case of Tay\u2013Sachs disease, ultrastructural examination is required.[30,31](#core-r030)*Dr. Harris:* We do not know whether the placenta was examined in this case.*Dr. Verne S. Caviness* (Neurology): Is there a cell-biologic explanation for the early-onset startle response?*Dr. Krishnamoorthy:* I posed this question to Dr. Edwin Kolodny, at New York University School of Medicine. He reported that in the 1970s, Dominick Purpura at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in New York,[32](#core-r032) showed that infants with Tay\u2013Sachs disease had meganeurite formation at the axon hillock of neurons that had been prepared with Golgi stain, a finding later confirmed by researchers at several other laboratories.[33](#core-r033) Along with this change was a remarkable increase in the number of spinous processes protruding from the axon at the same location as the enlargements. These spines are believed to be excitatory and can explain the remarkable startle response (Kolodny EH: personal communication).\n",

      "question": "A 22-year-old man was seen in the neurology clinic because of an unexplained creatine kinase elevation.\nHe had been well until the age of 17 years, when congestive heart failure developed; microscopical examination of a specimen from a left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy revealed myocarditis (\nFigure 1\n). Immunosuppressive therapy, digoxin, and diuretic and vasodilator medications caused no improvement in the patient's condition. One year later, the heart failure had worsened, and during the next 20 months, a series of left ventricular\u2013biopsy specimens showed healed myocarditis, with focal fibrosis and hypertrophy (\nFigure 2\n). An orthotopic cardiac transplantation was performed. Episodes of grade 2 rejection two, five, and nine months after the transplantation were managed successfully with corticosteroid medication. The patient's condition was subsequently stable, until 18 months later, when the creatine kinase level was found to be 1298 U per liter, and the aspartate aminotransferase level was found to be 48 U per liter. He was referred to the neurology clinic.\nA single creatine kinase measurement immediately before the transplantation and repeated aspartate aminotransferase measurements had shown normal values. The patient's medications at the time of referral included cyclosporine (150 mg twice daily), azathioprine (200 mg daily), prednisone (5 mg daily), ranitidine, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. The patient reported mild muscle cramps, especially in the triceps, shoulder, and upper back muscles, on awakening that were quickly relieved by stretching. He had no muscle weakness, fasciculations, sphincter abnormalities, visual disturbances, sensory problems, or gastrointestinal symptoms. His only sibling, a brother who was 20 years old, had congestive heart failure that required treatment with digoxin. One maternal uncle had died of \u201ccardiomyopathy\u201d at the age of 18 years, and another had died of a cardiac problem, possibly an infarct, at 52 years. Two maternal aunts, 46 and 53 years old, were well, and the older aunt had three healthy sons. A maternal great-uncle had died of heart disease at the age of 19 years.\nThe patient appeared healthy. The cranial-nerve functions were normal. Motor examination showed excellent muscle definition, without atrophy or fasciculations. Muscle tone and power were normal throughout the body. There was no percussion-induced or exertion-induced myotonia. Sensation was intact. The deep-tendon reflexes were ++ and symmetric; the plantar responses were flexor. The gait was normal, including tandem gait and walking on toes and heels. The patient hopped easily on either foot and arose from a deep knee bend without difficulty.\nEnzyme levels are shown in\nTable 1\n. Radiographs of the chest revealed no abnormalities. Neurophysiologic examination of the right arm and leg and axial nerves showed no nerve-conduction or needle electromyographic abnormalities.\nTwo weeks later, hematologic laboratory tests were performed (\nTable 2\n) and enzyme measurements were repeated (\nTable 1\n). The conjugated bilirubin level was 0.3 mg per deciliter (5.1 \u03bcmol per liter), and the total bilirubin level was 1.1 mg per deciliter (18.8 \u03bcmol per liter). Other blood chemical values were normal.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. H. Royden Jones, Jr.[\\*](#FN1): This discussion will evaluate the relation of the patient's elevated creatine kinase level to the familial cardiomyopathy and to toxic agents, including cyclosporine.Creatine kinase catalyzes the reversible phosphorylation of creatine by ATP. The enzyme is found in many tissues but is most concentrated in skeletal muscle, the brain, and the heart.[1](#core-r001) Creatine kinase has two primary isomers, the M and B forms. MM predominates in skeletal muscle, BB in brain tissue, and MB in cardiac muscle. The MB form is present in about 6 percent of striated muscle.[1](#core-r001) In this case, the normal isoenzyme index and the elevation of aldolase, another predominant enzyme of skeletal muscle, appear to rule out cardiac muscle as the primary source of the creatine kinase elevation.Creatine kinase is typically elevated in myopathies, particularly those involving tissue destruction. In some dystrophinopathies, including Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophies, the creatine kinase values are 20 to 50 times the normal value. In severe acute myopathies that induce myoglobinuria, such as McArdle's disease,[2](#core-r002) the level may be as high as 100 to 500 times the normal value. Elevated creatine kinase levels may herald the onset of a myopathy, as in the Miyoshi syndrome.[3](#core-r003) In three males without neuromuscular symptoms who were 15 to 20 years old, the values were similar to those in this patient.[4](#core-r004) Both electromyography and muscle biopsy demonstrated the presence of myopathy; symptoms of a predominantly distal myopathy appeared two to seven years later.Spinal muscular atrophies are also associated with slight elevations of creatine kinase.[5](#core-r005) The most common form in this patient's age group is Kugelberg\u2013Welander disease. Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which in rare cases occurs in the third decade of life, have slightly increased serum creatine kinase values; patients with the post-polio syndrome may have levels that are up to five times the normal value.[6](#core-r006) This patient had no clinical or electromyographic signs of these motor-neuron disorders.Rowland et al.[7](#core-r007) reported the isolated finding of an elevated creatine kinase level, with no more than minor clinical or electromyographic evidence of motor-unit abnormalities, in 10 patients; 8 of the 10 were men, and 8 were less than 40 years old. Even when a creatine kinase elevation is idiopathic, there may be an inherent susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia.[7](#core-r007) In one study of 30 patients with idiopathic elevations of creatine kinase, 36 percent had this susceptibility.[8](#core-r008) In a four-year follow-up study of three men with creatine kinase elevations, two had the susceptibility.[9](#core-r009)The differential diagnosis of an elevated kinase level includes a broad spectrum of nonmyopathic disorders that warrant consideration before a discussion of the primary skeletal myopathies. The first step is to verify the persistence of the elevation, because it is transient in some cases. Elevated creatine kinase levels may be associated with very strenuous exercise, such as marathon running.[10](#core-r010) Less strenuous activities, including manual labor, may produce a slight increase. Transient elevations may result from recent intramuscular injections and muscle ischemia, particularly with crush injuries, or from sepsis, convulsions, the neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or the performance of electromyographic studies in the absence of muscular disease.[11](#core-r011)In a study of 14 Dutch patients with unexplained elevations of creatine kinase, there were no abnormalities on neurologic and thyroid examination, electromyography, or muscle biopsy.[12](#core-r012) None of the patients had a family history of neuromuscular disease or exposure to toxins. Eleven of the patients were men, and the age range was 20 to 64 years. Creatine kinase values ranged from 1.4 to 19 times the normal value and were less than 5 times the normal value in all but 3 of the 14 patients. The levels of serum lactate and ammonia rose normally on ischemic exercise testing, making muscle phosphorylase deficiency unlikely. The three highest values were in a mechanic, a sheet-metal worker, and a gardener.[12](#core-r012) We do not know this patient's occupation.The serum myoadenylate level was subnormal in 2 of the 14 Dutch patients, including 1 of the manual workers,[12](#core-r012) but the clinical importance of myoadenylate deficiency is controversial. Hypoparathyroidism can cause elevated creatine kinase levels,[13](#core-r013) as can hypothyroidism. Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism reduced creatine kinase to normal levels in one of the Dutch patients.[12](#core-r012) In four of the patients, no causes of the creatine kinase elevations were identified.Fourteen of 19 American patients (74 percent) with elevated creatine kinase levels had myopathic findings on electromyography, and all 14 had abnormal findings on biopsy.[14](#core-r014) Polymyositis was found in five patients, two of whom had creatine kinase values similar to those in this patient, and weakness subsequently developed in four of the five. Other diagnoses included a mitochondrial myopathy (in two patients), nonspecific myopathy (in three), and inclusion-body myositis, sarcoidosis, McArdle's disease, and multicore disease (in one each). Of the five patients with normal electromyographic findings, four had normal findings on examination of muscle-biopsy specimens, and one had central core disease, a rare congenital myopathy.In this case, the neuromuscular symptoms were mild, transient cramps of the upper arm, shoulder, and upper back muscles on awakening. Cramps are sudden, involuntary, painful, self-limited, nonspecific muscular contractions originating at multiple sites, including the anterior horn cell, peripheral nerve, and muscle.[15](#core-r015) Cramps that occur at rest are common in otherwise normal persons; their meaning in isolation is difficult to gauge. \u201cGrowing pains\u201d in children are similarly benign and are usually confined to the legs. Pathologically important myalgia is generally associated with demonstrable weakness, but cramps are unusual in patients with typical inflammatory myopathy. An association between muscle cramps and specific pathophysiologic changes is most common in patients with McArdle's disease or other congenital disorders of energy metabolism. With myophosphorylase deficiency, the cramps are often induced by exercise and associated with myoglobinuria. In such cases, creatine kinase values that are normal or elevated at rest may increase greatly after strenuous exercise. Ischemic exercise testing is therefore useful in screening for these rare autosomal recessive disorders. However, evaluation of a patient with isolated myalgia may not yield a specific neuromuscular diagnosis. It was made in only 33 percent of 109 cases in one series,[16](#core-r016) and muscle biopsy was the most sensitive test. Extensive investigation may not reveal a specific cause of isolated creatine kinase elevations.[12,14,16](#core-r012) The patient under discussion had no demonstrable weakness. His physique was not described. In persons with a large muscle mass, such as football players, the creatine kinase level may be twice the normal value but is not extremely elevated, as in this patient.[17](#core-r017)The striking history of cardiomyopathy in the young men in the patient's family raises the possibility of an X-linked process or, less likely, a mitochondrial disorder, particularly one affecting both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Duchenne's and Becker's X-linked muscular dystrophies involve cardiac and skeletal muscle. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is unlikely in a man in his 20s, but the Becker form may present as late as the third decade of life. Cardiac involvement may precede skeletal-muscle symptoms and is often unrelated to the extent of musculoskeletal involvement.[18](#core-r018) In one study, 2 of 59 patients with Becker's muscular dystrophy presented with exertional dyspnea before the onset of neurologic symptoms.[19](#core-r019) One patient, who was 25 years old, underwent heart transplantation because of severe cardiac failure. He had an elevated creatine kinase level and calf hypertrophy but no neuromuscular weakness.[19](#core-r019) In the patient under discussion, the normal creatine kinase value before transplantation makes a dystrophinopathy less likely.Emery\u2013Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, another X-linked myopathy, is characterized by scapulohumeral and peroneal weakness, with wasting of the upper arm, paradoxical preservation of the deltoid muscles, elbow contractures, and tightness of the spinal extensor muscle.[20](#core-r020) The creatine kinase level is only slightly elevated. In contrast to the cardiomyopathy that accompanies the dystrophinopathies, cardiac-conduction abnormalities, which may be life-threatening, are associated with Emery\u2013Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Occasionally, however, the disorder presents as an adult-onset cardiomyopathy.[21](#core-r021)A few very rare X-linked myopathies are associated with cardiomyopathy. One of these disorders is the Macleod syndrome,[22](#core-r022) a neuroacanthocytosis in which a progressive cardiomyopathy and elevation of creatine kinase may precede the onset of chorea, which is more typical of the disorder, but this patient had neither chorea nor acanthocytosis.Some of the congenital myopathies are associated with cardiomyopathy, including X-linked centronuclear, late-onset nemaline, myotubular, megaconial, multicore, reducing-body, and tubular-aggregate myopathies, but they typically cause only a slight elevation of creatine kinase.[23](#core-r023) With many congenital myopathies, the initial presentation is described as similar to that of the floppy infant syndrome. Particularly with the autosomal dominant forms, the onset may occur during adolescence, but only rarely, and patients usually have an ophthalmoparesis.Pompe's disease, an acid maltase\u2013deficiency syndrome, typically has a cardiomyopathic component in a newborn but not in an adult.[24](#core-r024) The serum creatine kinase level may be very elevated, and the electromyographic studies may show many complex repetitive discharges, suggesting an inflammatory myopathy.[25](#core-r025) Juvenile and adult-onset acid maltase deficiency is characterized by a skeletal myopathy or respiratory compromise, or both, and a cardiac component is usually not evident.[26](#core-r026) Primary myopathic carnitine deficiency, an autosomal recessive lipid-storage disorder, may also mimic an inflammatory myopathy.[27](#core-r027)A mitochondrial cardioskeletal myopathy, which led to the death of a 14-year-old boy, was associated with magnesium deficiency and a slight elevation of creatine kinase.[28](#core-r028) A depressed level of serum magnesium was not mentioned in the case under discussion. Mitochondrial disorders such as the Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome have cardiac components, but they are usually conduction abnormalities, not cardiomyopathies.[29](#core-r029) Patients typically have an ophthalmoplegia, with an elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid. \u201cRagged-red fibers\u201d are observed in muscle-biopsy specimens. Myotonic dystrophy includes cardiac-conduction involvement, but this patient had no myotonia.Familial desminopathy is a rare disorder of cytoskeletal protein filaments that presents with a cardiomyopathy; by late adolescence, a symptomatic skeletal myopathy also develops.[30](#core-r030) In a study of two affected siblings, the creatine kinase levels were normal and the electromyographic findings were characteristic of a myopathy, in contrast to the findings in this case.[30](#core-r030)In view of this patient's family history, examination of his native heart may have ruled out a familial cardioskeletal myopathy. It would be important to know his brother's creatine kinase level, but the normal level in the patient before the transplantation and the markedly elevated level four years later suggest a new process or an underlying cardioskeletal myopathy with intermittent elevations of the enzyme. Although it is difficult to disregard the family history, the normal level of creatine kinase is more compatible with a toxic myopathy than with a familial disorder.The use of alcohol or illicit drugs, such as \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine, can cause isolated creatine kinase elevations. Ethanol can cause a chronic or acute necrotizing myopathy. Persons who abuse cocaine may present with an acute toxic myopathy, with severe myalgia and myoglobinuria, although half the cases are subclinical. The diagnosis may be made initially during the investigation of an elevated creatine kinase level.[31](#core-r031) Cocaine also has a cardiotoxic effect. This case history includes no evidence of drug abuse.Agents such as clofibrate, labetalol, cimetidine, gold, tryptophan, lithium, and nifedipine can cause muscle pain, cramps, and fasciculations.[32](#core-r032) This patient was not taking any of the cardiac medications that may cause a reversible myotonia, including cholesterol-lowering agents, \u03b22-adrenergic blockers, and diuretics. His electromyogram showed no myotonic reaction. In rare cases, a necrotizing myopathy, characterized by muscle pain and weakness and sometimes associated with myoglobinuria and an elevated creatine kinase level, has a pharmacologic cause. Aminocaproic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, has been implicated, as have zidovudine and lipid-lowering drugs, such as lovastatin.Emetine, an ipecac alkaloid, affects skeletal muscle[33](#core-r033) and causes severe, potentially fatal cardiotoxic changes. The serum creatine kinase level may be greatly elevated. Young people with bulimia may use emetine surreptitiously, but we have no reason to suspect such use by this patient. He did not require any diuretics, nor did he have hypokalemia, which itself may lead to a myopathy.[32](#core-r032) Proximal myopathy is one of the most common side effects of treatment with corticosteroids, but they do not raise creatine kinase levels and they typically cause myopathic weakness.There are seven reported cases of cyclosporine-associated myopathy.[34\u201338](#core-r034) Most of the patients had severe muscle pain and cramps and creatine kinase levels as high as 6 to 10 times the normal value; the levels were normal in a few cases, including two associated with hypomagnesemia.[36,38](#core-r036) The onset of toxicity ranged from three weeks[34](#core-r034) to seven years[38](#core-r038) after the initiation of therapy. Electromyographic studies showed normal findings,[34](#core-r034) myopathy,[35,36,38](#core-r035) or peripheral neuropathy without myopathy.[37](#core-r037) The symptoms disappeared and the serum creatine kinase levels returned to normal after the drug had been discontinued or the dosage reduced.[35\u201337](#core-r035) In one patient, the resumption of treatment led to recurrent symptoms, but the myopathy again resolved when the dose was tapered.[34](#core-r034) Muscle biopsies showed segmental necrosis,[34](#core-r034) segmental necrosis with an acute myositis,[36](#core-r036) and an accumulation of subsarcolemmal enlarged mitochrondria containing glycogen[35](#core-r035) or lipids,[37](#core-r037) which are associated with a vacuolar myopathy. In addition to cyclosporine, the patient under discussion took trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, ranitidine, and azathioprine, all of which have been linked anecdotally to myalgia or a toxic myopathy.Elevated creatine kinase levels can be evaluated by performing a number of studies that presumably were negative in this case, including measurement of serum calcium, magnesium, and dystrophin levels; evaluation of thyroid and parathyroid function; examination of a blood smear for acanthocytes; urinalysis to detect myoglobin; and ischemic exercise testing for myophosphorylase deficiency. The diagnostic procedure was most likely a muscle biopsy. Although I cannot rule out a primary myopathy, the data suggest a vacuolar myopathy, possibly with abnormally enlarged mitochondria, as reported in cases of cyclosporine myotoxicity.[38](#core-r038)\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Suzanne M. de la Monte: Examination of specimens from a skeletal-muscle biopsy showed both atrophic and hypertrophic fibers, focal myofiber necrosis, myophagocytosis, and degeneration of individual myofibers ([Figure 3](#f03) and [Figure 4](#f04)). Histochemical staining was unrevealing. However, after learning about the family history, we considered the diagnosis of familial myopathy affecting both cardiac and skeletal muscle and proceeded with immunohistochemical and molecular studies to determine whether a dystrophinopathy was present. Immunohistochemical staining ([Figure 5A](#f05), [Figure 5B](#f05), [Figure 5C](#f05), [Figure 5D](#f05), [Figure 5E](#f05), [Figure 5F](#f05)) revealed reduced immunoreactivity to dystrophin 1, dystrophin 2, and dystrophin 3, with focal or patchy loss of sarcolemmal staining in scattered myofibers, as compared with the uniform and intense staining of normal muscle. In contrast, immunostaining for dystrophin-associated proteins such as \u03b1-sarcoglycan was normal. Western blot analysis demonstrated an 80 percent reduction in the level of dystrophin protein but no detectable mutant forms of the molecule. These findings are most consistent with the diagnosis of Becker's muscular dystrophy.Both Becker's and Duchenne's muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations in the Xp21.1 locus.[19,39](#core-r019) In Duchenne's dystrophy, the expression of dystrophin protein is absent, causing an early onset of fatal disease. Loss of ambulation occurs by the age of 12 years. Becker's muscular dystrophy is caused by point mutations, deletions, or duplications resulting in partial expression of the normal protein. Early-onset Becker's muscular dystrophy, as compared with late-onset disease, is correlated with larger point deletions and lower levels of functional dystrophin-protein expression. The histopathological findings in muscle specimens range from nonspecific to obvious dystrophic changes, but a consistent finding is the focal or patchy irregular loss of dystrophin immunoreactivity in individual myofibers,[40,41](#core-r040) as observed in this case. The overall levels of dystrophin immunoreactivity are also often reduced.[19,39,41,42](#core-r019)The dystrophin gene is very large, approximately 2500 kb, and located on the short arm of the X chromosome.[19,39](#core-r019) Dystrophin protein is membrane-associated and functions as part of the cytoskeleton. In Becker's muscular dystrophy, most of the mutations occur in the rod domain of the dystrophin molecule.[19,39,42\u201344](#core-r019) Disease that develops earlier and is more severe is associated with mutations in the amino terminal, including the promoter region.[43](#core-r043) Disease that develops later and is milder is associated with the preservation of the carboxy terminal,[44](#core-r044) which is required for interaction with dystrophin-associated proteins. Almost a third of cases of Becker's muscular dystrophy cannot be categorized in these terms, however, since the mutations appear to be either novel or sporadic. Moreover, reductions in the expression of dystrophin-associated molecules due to mutations can disrupt the linkage between the sarcolemmal cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Mutations in dystrophin molecules or dystrophin-associated proteins result in loss of the integrity of myofiber membrane and attendant influx of extracellular-fluid proteins and calcium.[45](#core-r045) High levels of intracellular calcium can precipitate an apoptosis cascade, resulting in loss of myofibers. Since dystrophin is abundantly expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle, cardiomyopathy may complicate the clinical course of Becker's or Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.[46](#core-r046)The diagnosis of Becker's muscular dystrophy can be made by muscle biopsy with immunohistochemical staining for dystrophin and dystrophin-associated protein.[19,39\u201342](#core-r019) The diagnosis should be confirmed by Western blot analysis, polymerase chain reaction, amplification of genomic DNA with Southern blot analysis to detect mutations, or analysis of the appropriate exons. One can also detect genomic mutations by using DNA from peripheral-blood lymphocytes.Dr. Navneet Narula: Examination of the specimen from the left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy performed 20 months before transplantation revealed a few foci of myocardial necrosis, with a macrophage reaction as well as multiple areas of healing. Examination of the specimen obtained four months later showed patchy fibrosis with no inflammation.The explanted heart weighed 410 g and was flabby, with biventricular dilatation. Histologic examination showed patchy interstitial and replacement fibrosis \u2014 a finding consistent with the presence of dilated cardiomyopathy.Cardiac involvement is an inherent feature of three major familial neuromyopathic diseases: progressive muscular dystrophies (such as early-onset Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, late-onset Becker's muscular dystrophy, and facioscapulohumeral and limb-girdle dystrophy), myotonic muscular dystrophies, and Friedreich's ataxia.[47](#core-r047) Other, less common neuromyopathic diseases associated with cardiac involvement include the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nemaline myopathy, myasthenia gravis, and McArdle's disease. Morphologic cardiac changes are usually seen in Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophies and in Friedreich's ataxia.Symptomatic cardiac involvement is found in 15 percent of patients with Becker's muscular dystrophy who are less than 16 years old and in 73 percent of those who are more than 40 years old, but cardiomyopathy is rarely the predominant clinical finding.[48](#core-r048) All four chambers are involved, with dilatation, and staining for dystrophin shows a pattern similar to that seen in skeletal muscle.[49](#core-r049)The diagnosis of cardiomyopathy associated with a dystrophinopathy cannot be based on routine histologic examination, because the findings are nonspecific. The diagnosis can be made by demonstrating abnormal immunohistochemical staining for dystrophin in endomyocardial-biopsy specimens. However, since isolated cardiac involvement in dystrophinopathy is very rare, staining every biopsy specimen that shows dilated cardiomyopathy for the presence of dystrophinopathy is not justified. Recent studies[49,50](#core-r049) have failed to show any value of such an investigation, except in cases in which the clinical suspicion is high or there is a family history of cardiomyopathy with an elevated creatine kinase level.Dr. E. Tessa Hedley-Whyte: Is it possible to stain for dystrophins on paraffin sections?Dr. de la Monte: No. Antibodies against dystrophins for use on paraffin sections have not yet been generated.Dr. Jones: I still wonder whether cyclosporine contributed to the elevated creatine kinase level, especially given the vacuolation shown in the muscle-biopsy specimen. The normal pretransplantation level makes this case unique.Dr. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr.: The patient's brother had elevated creatine kinase levels before the patient underwent transplantation and thus before the patient's exposure to cyclosporine. The mother's level was slightly elevated. When cyclosporine-associated myopathy was suspected in the patient, the dose of the drug was reduced, but the creatine kinase level was not affected.Dr. Eugene J. Mark: How early in life can a dystrophin abnormality be identified? Is there a screening test for use in early childhood or even in utero?Dr. Sandrock: Prenatal screening for dystrophin mutations is available, but the standard assays might have been falsely negative in this family. Since the molecular weight of the dystrophin protein in the patient's muscle was normal on Western blot analysis, this phenotype of Becker's muscular dystrophy probably resulted either from a mutation in the promoter region of the dystrophin gene or from a subtle mutation (e.g., a point mutation or small deletion) in the coding region of the gene. In fact, an X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy associated with a deletion of the promoter region of dystrophin has been reported.[51](#core-r051) I do not think that mutations in the promoter region (usually in the 5' untranslated portion of the gene) or subtle mutations in the coding region would be detected by the standard prenatal tests for dystrophinopathy, which generally detect large disruptions in the coding region of the gene.Dr. Marc J. Semigran: Both the patient and his brother have been well since the cardiac transplantation.\n",

      "question": "A 63-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of flank pain.\nHe was well until 13 years earlier, when peripheral edema developed. One month later he noticed impaired vision. On the following day he had a grandmal seizure and was brought to the hospital. Physical examination showed that the blood pressure was 230/110 mm Hg. No peripheral edema was evident. Neurologic examination revealed signs of cortical blindness and confusion; no focal neurologic defect was apparent. The urine gave a ++++ test for protein; the sediment contained 4 white cells, 6 red cells, and rare coarsely granular casts per high-power field. The hematocrit was 50 per cent, and the white-cell count 18,800. The urea nitrogen was 16 mg per 100 ml (5.7 mmol per liter), the glucose 160 mg per 100 ml (8.9 mmol per liter), the cholesterol 288 mg per 100 ml (7.45 mmol per liter), and the protein 5.7 g per 100 ml. Serum electrophoresis revealed that the albumin was 44 per cent, the alpha\n1\nglobulin 7 per cent, the alpha\n2\nglobulin 16 per cent, the beta globulin 13 per cent, and the gamma globulin 20 per cent. In a 24-hour specimen of urine the protein was 7.5 g. An electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal rhythm at a rate of 70, with extensive T-wave abnormalities consistent with anterolateral ischemia. X-ray films of the chest revealed bilateral apical fibrocalcific scarring, consistent with old tuberculous infection; several nodules were believed to be tuberculomas, possibly active. An LE-cell test was negative. A lumbar puncture yielded normal cerebrospinal fluid under a normal pressure. An electroencephalogram showed diffuse slowing. A brain scan was normal. Phenytoin sodium was administered. The patient's vision cleared rapidly, and there was no recurrence of seizures. Another electroencephalogram was normal. A urinary-tract infection secondary to infection with klebsiella species responded to the administration of sulfisoxazole. The blood pressure fell to 150/70 mm Hg. The patient was discharged on a low-sodium diet and phenytoin sodium.\nOne month later he returned to the hospital because of fever and was found to have acute pyelonephritis. The urea nitrogen was 20 mg per 100 ml (7.1 mmol per liter), and the creatinine 1.8 mg per 100 ml (160 \u03bcmol per liter). Two LE-cell tests were negative. An intravenous urographic examination showed prompt bilateral nephrograms of equal concentration; the right kidney was 14 by 7 cm, and the left 15.5 by 6.5 cm; the renal calyxes were partially obscured by overlying bowel gas, but no abnormality was identified; the ureters were only partially seen but were not dilated; the bladder was not observed. In several 24-hour specimens of urine the protein ranged between 6.4 and 7.9 g. The evidence of urinary-tract infection subsided on antibiotic treatment. Microscopical examination of a needle-aspiration-biopsy specimen of the kidney disclosed chronic lobular glomerulonephritis and focal chronic pyelonephritis. He was given prednisone, isoniazid, and pyridoxine and was discharged.\nDuring the next six months prednisone was continued, but the edema and proteinuria increased. He was readmitted to the hospital, where physical examination showed that the blood pressure was 150/100 mm Hg. There was +++ peripheral edema. The urine gave a ++ test for protein. The hematocrit was 20 per cent, and the white-cell count 4100. The creatinine was 3.5 mg per 100 ml (310 \u03bcmol per liter), and the cholesterol 230 mg per 100 ml (6.0 mmol per liter). In a 24-hour specimen of urine the protein was 4.4 g. The 24-hour creatinine clearance was 39 liters. Excretory urograms showed slight delay in opacification of the collecting systems but were otherwise unchanged. Transfusions of whole blood were administered. Another needle-aspiration biopsy of the kidney revealed chronic active lobular glomerulonephritis with lipid changes; all the glomeruli were involved by membranous thickening in a lobular pattern, and rare glomeruli were totally sclerosed; the glomerular lesions were not markedly increased in comparison with the previous biopsy specimen; cholesterol clefts were observed in many tubules, and scattered lipophages were seen in the interstitium; there was lipid deposition in tubular epithelial cells; evidence of acute nephrotic interstitial inflammation was present. Prednisone was discontinued, and the patient was discharged on azathioprine and phenytoin sodium. During the next eight months the urea nitrogen rose to 117 mg per 100 ml (41.8 mmol per liter), the creatinine to 11.3 mg per 100 ml (999 \u03bcmol per liter), and the phosphorus to 10.2 mg per 100 ml (3.29 mmol per liter). The blood pressure rose to 230/110 mm Hg, and methyldopa was begun. Repeated transfusions were administered.\nDuring the next five years the patient's condition remained stable. Seven years before entry an arteriovenous fistula was created in the left forearm in anticipation of extracorporeal hemodialysis. Two years later he noticed a pulsatile mass in the left midabdomen, and an ultrasound study disclosed aneurysmal dilatation, approximately 5 by 5 by 6 cm, of the lower portion of the abdominal aorta above and at its bifurcation; the aneurysm extended into the left iliac artery, and there was slight dilatation of the right iliac artery. He was readmitted to the hospital. The urine gave a ++ test for protein; the sediment contained rare hyaline casts. The urea nitrogen was 74 mg per 100 ml (26 mmol per liter), the creatinine 9.2 mg per 100 ml (810 \u03bcmol per liter), the glucose 65 mg per 100 ml (3.6 mmol per liter), the calcium 7.8 mg per 100 ml (2.0 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 5.7 mg per 100 ml (1.8 mmol per liter), the cholesterol 233 mg per 100 ml (6.03 mmol per liter), and the protein 7.4 g (the albumin 3.9 g, and the globulin 3.5 g) per 100 ml. Extracorporeal hemodialysis was initiated, and on the fifth hospital day an abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy was performed, with grafts to the left external and right common iliac arteries. Inspection of the kidneys at operation disclosed no abnormality. The patient was discharged on the 22d hospital day.\nDuring the next five years the patient continued to receive hemodialysis three times weekly at another hospital. The hematocrit ranged between 45 and 50 per cent. One day before admission, after hemodialysis, he experienced severe pain in the right flank. Five hours later the blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg systolic, and fluids were administered intravenously. On the day of admission a tender mass was found in the right flank, and the hematocrit fell from 46 to 35 per cent. He returned to this hospital.\nThe temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the pulse 80, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared pale. Examination of the abdomen showed a large, tender, firm area in the right flank, without rebound tenderness. The bowel sounds were normal, and no bruit was heard. Pulses in the lower extremities were ++ except that both posterior tibial and the left dorsalis pedis pulses were trace; the feet were cool. Rectal examination revealed that the prostate gland was minimally enlarged and symmetric.\nA few drops of yellow urine were obtained by a catheter and were insufficient for urinalysis. The hematocrit was 33.8 per cent; the white-cell count was 6500, and the platelet count 121,000. The prothrombin time and the partial thromboplastin time were normal. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The urea nitrogen was 38 mg per 100 ml (14 mmol per liter), the creatinine 11.6 mg per 100 ml (1030 \u03bcmol per liter), the glucose 181 mg per 100 ml (10.1 mmol per liter), the calcium 9.8 mg per 100 ml (2.5 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 4.9 mg per 100 ml (1.6 mmol per liter), the uric acid 4.5 mg per 100 ml (0.27 mmol per liter), the bilirubin 0.4 mg per 100 ml (7 \u03bcmol per liter), the triglyceride 142 mg per 100 ml, the cholesterol 163 mg per 100 ml (4.22 mmol per liter), and the protein 6.9 g (the albumin 3.6 g, and the globulin 3.3 g) per 100 ml. The sodium was 138 mmol, the potassium 6.2 mmol, the chloride 99 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 23 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) was 28 U per milliliter (0.23 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 131 U per milliliter (2.18 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), the creatine kinase (CK)13 mU per millilliter (0.22 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), theamylase\n31\nU, and the alkaline phosphatase 31 IU (0.52 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\n) per liter. An x-ray film of the chest disclosed subsegmental atelectasis at the left-lung base but no evidence of consolidation; the apical scarring appeared unchanged. A film of the abdomen showed an ill-defined increase in soft-tissue density in the right midabdomen; gas was observed in nondilated loops of small bowel on the left side; smaller volumes of gas were seen on the right side. A percutaneous selective angiographic examination demonstrated that the celiac axis and superior mesenteric arteries were patent; an aortoiliac bypass graft appeared normal; there was no evidence of false-aneurysm formation, and no hypogastric arterial aneurysms were identified; the left renal artery appeared small and atherosclerotic, with slow flow; a single right renal artery was severely atherosclerotic; no nephrogram was seen on either side; the right kidney was displaced anteriorly. A selective right renal angiographic examination (\nFig. 1\n) revealed that the kidney was shrunken; there was a patchy nephrographic phase, with slow flow; extravasation of contrast material was observed at the lower pole; branches to this region were selectively embolized with polyvinylalcohol (Ivalon) granules and a single 3-mm coil; during the procedure there was inadvertent dissection of contrast material around the right renal artery; no angiographic evidence of bleeding was found after the embolization.\nOn the evening of admission the blood pressure fell to 80 mm Hg systolic. Two units of packed red cells were administered, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate enemas were given. On the second hospital day pain persisted in the right flank. The hematocrit was 28 per cent. An operation was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Jerome P. Kassirer\\*: May we begin with a review of the x-ray films?Dr. Alan J. Greenfield: A film of the chest taken 13 years before admission demonstrates bilateral apical calcification consistent with old granulomatous disease, probably tuberculous. An intravenous urogram obtained at that time shows normal function of both kidneys and a normal appearance of the collecting systems. A urogram obtained six months later shows no change. A film of the chest obtained on admission also appears unchanged. A film of the abdomen reveals a hazy mass in the right mid-portion, with effacement of the right psoas margin. An aortogram obtained later in the same day also demonstrates the mass, which had enlarged during that brief interval. Both renal arteries are very small, with evidence of slow flow. A slightly later film from the abdominal aortographic examination shows the proximal anastomosis of the bifurcation graft, which appears normal, with no evidence of leakage or a false aneurysm. There is some irregularity in the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta. A still later film discloses very slow flow into the remaining segment of the right renal artery and the left renal artery. No nephrogram phase is identified on this film, and there is no evidence of a site of hemorrhage.A selective right renal arteriographic examination ([Fig. 1](#f001)) was then performed, with some difficulty because of the small size of the vessels. A magnification angiogram of the right kidney shows that the renal artery was very small, with multiple atherosclerotic plaques. The nephrogram is diffusely abnormal, with defects throughout. A site of extravasation of contrast material indicating active hemorrhage is visible at the lower lateral margin of the kidney. The right renal artery was occluded by transcatheter embolization, with use of poly vinylalcohol granules and a steel coil, in an attempt to control the hemorrhage. The final angiographic study shows no further extravasation. A longitudinal linear lucency seen in the right renal artery represents a dissection produced by the angiographic manipulation.Dr. Kassirer: In summary, this 63-year-old man with chronic glomerulonephritis treated with hemodialysis for five years experienced the onset of severeI shall focus first on the process that led to bleeding from the kidney. Rather than discuss this problem with all the information available in the case record, I shall proceed as if I had seen the patient when he was admitted to the hospital with bleeding into the flank. Then I shall explain my diagnostic reasoning as the new findings emerged. The purpose of this exercise is to reveal some of the richness of the diagnostic process. A discussion of the case only after all the facts were available would omit much of the interesting and important intermediary diagnostic thinking. Thus, at the risk of being accused of hindsight bias[1](#core-r001) I shall pretend that I do not know the results of the arteriographic examination and shall try to imagine what went through the minds of the clinicians taking care of the patient at the time of admission.What are the possible causes of nontraumatic bleeding from the kidney into the retroperitoneum? I have compiled a fairly complete collection of them from the literature ([Table 1](#t001)).[2\u20136](#core-r002) This is a putative list because in some of the cases I am not convinced that bleeding actually occurred as a result of the entities listed in the table. In regard to the case under discussion, several disorders can be eliminated immediately. Bleeding from a renal transplant or a normal kidney can be dismissed without elaboration. If renal-vein thrombosis leads to bleeding, as suggested in early studies,[2](#core-r002) that occurrence must be very unusual. Both obstruction and renal calculi are rarely the cause of bleeding, and we have no evidence of either in this case. Spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding occasionally occurs in association with infection of the kidney, such as cortical abscesses and tuberculosis.[3,4,7](#core-r003) Although the x-ray films of the chest showed changes in both apexes compatible with tuberculosis, these radiographic findings had not changed in five years, and the patient had no constitutional signs suggesting tuberculous infection. In addition, although he was said to have had pyelonephritis in the past, there was no evidence of recent renal infection. Cystic kidneys are rarely associated with bleeding into the flank, and no cysts were identified in this patient's kidneys. So I shall put this diagnosis aside tentatively. Nephritis is usually listed as a cause of spontaneous renal hemorrhage,[2,4](#core-r002) but according to my experience renal disease per se must be an exceptional cause. It is listed in the early literature and is not well documented.I shall comment only briefly about the patient's intrinsic renal disease because its cause is not particularly relevant to this discussion. On two occasions when the nephrotic syndrome occurred kidney biopsies disclosed a lobular proliferative pattern with membranous thickening of the glomerular capillary walls. This entity, then termed lobular glomerulonephritis, is currently referred to as membranoproliferativc glomerulonephritis. This form of the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome bears little or no specific relation to the events of the recent admission, although renal disease may well have predisposed the kidneys to bleeding.I assume that the five most common causes of nontraumatic bleeding from the kidneys are anticoagulation, vascular malformations, renal tumors, arteriosclerosis, and renal infarction.[2,4](#core-r002) Because spontaneous renal bleeding into the retroperitoneum is so uncommon no single investigator or institution has had substantial experience with it, and therefore my assumption is based on the frequency with which each of these causes has been reported in the literature over the past 10 years.Patients receiving anticoagulants can bleed into the retroperitoneum extensively enough to threaten their lives,[8\u201311](#core-r008) and there are several reports of uremic patients who have suffered this complication.[12\u201316](#core-r012) Added to the coagulopathy of the uremic state is the effect of heparin that is used during hemodialysis and, in some of the patients, the effect of coumadin given to prevent clotting within shunts and arteriovenous fistulas. The onset of bleeding during or immediately after dialysis in several patients[13,15](#core-r013) suggests that systemic heparinization was the cause. In fact, in the case under discussion severe flank pain, the initial sign of bleeding, first occurred after dialysis, suggesting that the bleeding began while the patient was receiving heparin. It should be pointed out that the source of the bleeding has been documented in only a minority of uremic or anticoagulated patients with retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Most of them were not studied by arteriography, and pathological specimens were rarely obtained because the bleeding often ceased spontaneously. Nonetheless, there are some well-documented examples of spontaneous renal bleeding in such patients.[12,17](#core-r012) Bleeding of this type is not surprising in view of the proclivity of uremic patients on dialysis to have bleeding in other sites, including the pericardium, the gastrointestinal tract, and the subdural space.[18,19](#core-r018) So even though few documented cases of bleeding from the kidney as a result of anticoagulation exist, it must be considered a possible cause or at least a contributory cause in the patient under discussion.Vascular malformations, such as renal-artery aneurysms and arteriovenous fistulas, can also bleed into the retroperitoneum. Both can be diagnosed with confidence only by an arteriographic examination, but several observations can be made about them before we consider the arteriographic findings. Spontaneous renal-artery aneurysms are rare, and they seldom bleed into the retroperitoneum. Aneurysms secondary to polyarteritis and Wegener's granulomatosis may rupture and bleed,[20\u201323](#core-r020) but bleeding associated with such aneurysms can also be caused by segmental infarction of the kidney rather than rupture of the aneurysm per se.[4,20,24](#core-r004) In this case there is no clinical evidence of polyarteritis. Consideration of an arteriovenous fistula of the kidney is relevant mainly because the patient underwent two kidney biopsies more than 12 years earlier and because such arteriovenous malformations may develop after a renal biopsy. On the other hand, the fistulas usually close spontaneously in months, typically cause hypertension when they persist, and rarely bleed.[25\u201327](#core-r025) Thus, even without the arteriographic findings the probability of a fistula is very small.Bleeding into the flank may be the first sign of a renal tumor. The types that bleed include renal-cell carcinomas,[28,29](#core-r028) angiomyolipomas,[30\u201333](#core-r030) sarcomas, Wilms' tumors,[34](#core-r034) and many more.[28,35,36](#core-r028) The diagnosis is usually made by an arteriographic examination.Finally, I must consider the possibility of arteriosclerosis or renal infarction as the cause of the bleeding. Bleeding secondary to arteriosclerosis has not been well described in the literature. Theoretically, the weakened wall of a sclerotic vessel could rupture, particularly under the influence of hypertension, as can occur in the eye and the brain. However, in recently reported cases of retroperitoneal hemorrhage of renal origin in patients with severe arteriosclerosis vascular occlusion and infarction have been documented,[37,38](#core-r037) and therefore I shall include arteriosclerosis along with other causes of renal infarction.Renal infarction usually results from either thrombosis or embolism.[39](#core-r039) Bleeding secondary to infarction occurs in patients with severe arteriosclerosis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, lupus erythematosus, the sickle-cell trait, or polyarteritis.[24,36\u201338,40\u201343](#core-r024) I shall dismiss all these possibilities except for severe arteriosclerosis. The patient had several factors that predispose to arteriosclerosis, including the nephrotic syndrome, moderate hypertension, and long-standing dialysis. In addition, the history of an aortic aneurysm five years ago supports that diagnosis, as does the radiologic evidence of atherosclerosis of the aorta. Although the patient did not have hematuria, its absence does not exclude renal infarction as a cause of retroperitoneal bleeding.[38,40](#core-r038) Thus, we have strong evidence for the presence of severe arteriosclerosis but not necessarily for infarction.I cannot go much farther without considering the arteriograms, which reveal that the kidney was the source of the bleeding, that there was probably only a single site of bleeding in the lower pole, and that no mass or vascular occlusion was demonstrable. Most tumors that bleed are large and readily visible on an arteriographic examination.[44,45](#core-r044) Although the proportion of false-negative studies is unknown, it seems probable that a tumor was not the cause of the bleeding in this case. The arteriograms are also helpful in excluding an aneurysm and an arteriovenous fistula. If either had bled it would probably have filled during the study. Furthermore, bleeding from renal cysts should also be excluded by that study.I am left with renal disease, severe arteriosclerosis, and renal infarction as possibilities. The radiologic examination of the aorta showed many shaggy plaques, and there was extensive atherosclerosis of the main renal artery. The cortex was visualized in only a patchy fashion, but such a pattern is common in patients with chronic renal disease. Even though the arteriograms demonstrate no arterial occlusions, I cannot exclude the possibility that the poorly visualized areas were ischemic or even totally infarcted. We do not need to look very far for causes of ischemia. The major renal arteries and the intrarenal vessels were severely diseased. Plaques in the aorta and renal artery are ready sources of atheromatous debris that could embolize and occlude the renal microcirculation.[39](#core-r039) The lack of evidence of arterial occlusions on the arteriograms argues against gross renal infarction but does not exlude atheroembolism.[39](#core-r039)So it is possible to explain the massive bleeding in this patient on the basis of the anticoagulation secondary to both the administration of heparin and the platelet disorder of the uremic state, superimposed on the renal disease and severe arteriosclerosis. I cannot exclude the possibility that renal ischemia or infarction also contributed in a major way.What role did the therapeutic embolization and inadvertent renal-artery dissection induced by selective catheterization have in the renal bleeding? The original bleeding was probably impeded only transiently by the embolization. Persistence of bleeding in the kidney and in the gastrointestinal tract after embolization has been reported.[26,46](#core-r026) We know from the arteriograms that the coil became lodged in a vessel that probably did not supply the bleeding site, and we also know that only a small amount of polyvinylalcohol sponge was used because of the concern that the material would reflux and embolize elsewhere. The impact of the renal-artery dissection is difficult to assess. Both spontaneous renal-artery dissections and those induced by selective renal catheterization do of rupture and bleed, but when the dissection is extensive renal-artery occlusion and renal infarction are frequent complications.[47\u201354](#core-r047) Thus, if this patient's anticoagulated state promoted extension and expansion of the subintimal dissection it is possible that renal infarction occurred ultimately and exacerbated the bleeding.Was the decision to try transcatheter embolization a good one? Preliminary results suggest that this procedure is usually effective in stopping bleeding from the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and pelvis[55\u201359](#core-r055) when experts inject only the affected vessel. Indeed, therapeutic embolization may circumvent the risk of a surgical procedure in patients with other major medical problems. In this case the therapeutic embolization failed, and I assume that a nephrectomy was performed. From the standpoint of renal function, of course, nothing would have been lost by removal of this patient's kidney.Before concluding, I should like to comment about the diagnostic approach employed in clinicopathological conferences. The discussers typically describe various disorders that could explain the findings and finally focus on one of them. My approach was similar. Despite an already sizable literature on quantitative clinical problem-solving, it surprises me that none of the discussers have yet used this method to analyze a case. Before I knew the details of this case I had hoped to consider the diagnosis using Bayesian analysis and evaluate at least one of the major clinical decisions that was made with decision analysis. Unfortunately, I was thwarted in my desire to do either and had to settle for a sequential analysis of the diagnosis as the facts came to light. In this case the data were too scanty to apply Bayes' rule, which would have required at least a gross subjective estimate of the prior probability of each disorder that could cause bleeding,[60](#core-r060) and such data are unobtainable for this case. In addition, the rate of false-negative arteriographic examinations in cases of the various entities under consideration is unknown, and even if the frequency of the various causes were known it would not be possible to calculate the posterior probabilities given the arteriographic results.[60](#core-r060) Therefore, Bayesian analysis could not be carried out. Would decision analysis have contributed to the principal therapeutic choices in this case? That approach is usually recommended for clinical situations in which the optimal choice is uncertain[61\u201366](#core-r061) In this case there is little argument that an attempt to stop the bleeding by transcatheter embolization was appropriate. Decision analysis would almost certainly have arrived at the same conclusion. There is no doubt that both Bayesian analysis and decision analysis would enrich and enliven a clinicopathological conference, and I hope that these methods will be used soon for a suitable case.Finally, what do we gain from the prospective description of the diagnostic process that I followed today? First of all, we isolate and identify for the student the sequential diagnostic hypotheses generated and tested, following methods used by skilled physicians.[67,68](#core-r067) Secondly, we identify aspects of medical data that are lacking and pinpoint issues for further study. Thirdly, the reader can judge which of the many estimates and assessments that are made are consistent with his or her own experience and prejudices. Lastly, such a discussion exposes in a single physician the omissions, misjudgments, and misconceptions that flesh is heir to.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. David L. Gang: At operation Dr. Boyd H. Winslow evacuated a large right-sided hematoma containing approximately 2 liters of old blood and clot. He then found a shrunken polycystic kidney, which he removed en bloc. Close inspection of the specimen revealed rupture of a cyst in the lower pole, with blood dissecting from it through the capsule and into the fascia. The presence of cysts was puzzling, since there had been no previous clinical or pathological evidence of their presence.The renal-biopsy specimens obtained 13 years ago revealed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, Type I. In the first specimen examination of the glomeruli showed accentuation of the normal lobular pattern, mesangial hypercellularity, and capillary basement-membrane thickening ([Fig. 2](#f002)). No cysts were seen. In the second specimen glomerular-basement-membrane thickening, scattered glomerular neutrophilic infiltration, and tubular foam cells were seen. Neither immunofluorescence studies nor electron microscopical examination was performed at that time.The nephrectomy specimen, 10.5 cm in length, was larger than expected for an end-stage kidney, probably as a result of the presence of cysts containing fluid. Recent and organizing hemorrhage caused induration of the perirenal fibrofatty tissue. Beneath the capsule the cortical surface was scarred and studded with blood-filled and clear-fluid-filled cysts up to 2 cm in diameter. On sectioning cysts were found throughout the cortex and medulla, and marked irregular cortical thinning, poor corticomedullary demarcation, and prominent peripelvic fat were evident ([Fig. 3](#f003)). Except for the small size of the kidney the pattern of the cystic disease resembled that of autosomal-dominant adult polycystic disease. Although hemorrhage was concentrated about the lower pole and presumably originated in this location, no discrete bleeding point could be identified.Microscopical examination revealed an end-stage kidney with cysts, interstitial hemorrhage, and the vascular subendothelial proliferative change typically seen in patients on dialysis ([Fig. 4](#f004)). Almost no glomeruli were well preserved. Many of the cysts contained crystals consistent with calcium oxalate ([Fig. 5](#f005)). The cysts were lined by flat to cuboidal epithelium and in some areas by eosinophilic glassy hobnail cells thrown into papillary projections ([Fig. 6](#f006) and [7](#f007)).The cystic disease exemplified by this case falls into the category of the acquired cystic renal disease of long-term hemodialysis patients.[69\u201375](#core-r069) This entity was first defined in 1977 by Dunnill et al.,[69](#core-r069) who reported the finding of bilateral cystic disease at autopsy in 14 of 30 patients on long-term maintenance hemodialysis. None had had prior clinical, radiologic, or pathological evidence of renal cysts, and the mean duration of dialysis was 3.4 years. The most common clinical diagnosis in the 14 cases of cystic disease was chronic glomerulonephritis, but essential hypertension, HenochSch\u00f6nlein purpura, amyloidosis, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (two cases) were also diagnosed. The cysts varied in size and location and were lined by flattened to papillary epithelium; some of them were filled with hemorrhagic fluid and oxalate crystals. Renal tumors (multiple in five patients) developed in six patients, one of whom died of metastatic renal-cell carcinoma. The pathogenesis of acquired cystic renal disease is unknown, although obstruction by fibrosis or oxalate crystals, vascular compromise, and metabolic toxicity have been postulated as causes.[69,76](#core-r069) In more recent studies, which include both surgical and autopsy material, cysts were present in 30 to 50 per cent of patients on chronic hemodialysis.[70\u201372](#core-r070) The diagnosis in most of the cases has been made by examination of pathological specimens. In a recent prospective series from Japan, however, multiple cysts were found by computer-assisted tomographic study in 43.5 per cent of patients on dialysis for under three years and in 79.3 per cent of those on dialysis for a longer period.[73](#core-r073) The cysts were usually less than 1 cm in diameter. Three of the four patients from this study who underwent a nephrectomy had renal-cell carcinomas, two of which had been diagnosed on CT scans, and one had multiple adenomas. A number of authors have noted a frequency of 10 to 40 per cent of papillary adenomas and renal-cell carcinomas in the cystic kidneys of patients on dialysis.[69\u201375](#core-r069) These tumors may arise from the peculiar hyperplastic epithelium lining the cysts. Similar epithelial changes described in the renal cysts associated with tuberous sclerosis[77](#core-r077) have been associated with small adenomas and adenocarcinomas in our experience. The major complications of acquired cystic disease are hemorrhage and tumor formation. The patient under discussion should be checked periodically for the possible development of a tumor in the remaining kidney.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Do you think that the polycystic disease per se was related to the hemorrhage?Dr. Gang: Yes. I think that spontaneous rupture of a vessel into a cyst caused the bleeding.Dr. Kassirer: Is it conceivable that the arteriographie findings are explicable on the basis of multiple cysts instead of diffuse vascular disease? In retrospect, I wonder if the patchy areas of nonfilling on the arteriograms could have been caused by large cysts.Dr. Greenfield: The findings on the selective renal arteriograms are consistent with multiple cysts.Dr. Kassirer: Have there been any other cases in which such acquired cysts were associated with bleeding into the flank?Dr. Gang: In the original series by Dunnill et al. there was one case in which acquired cystic disease was complicated by an extensive left-sided renal hematoma, and there was another in which hemorrhage into the cysts produced renal enlargement.Dr. Arthur S. Pier, Jr.: Do you think that hemodialysis is responsible for this cystic change, or does it just keep the patient alive long enough so that the cysts form in an end-stage kidney?Dr. Gang: The latter interpretation is probably correct. A number of other interesting proliferative renal lesions have been described in patients on long-term dialysis,[78\u201381](#core-r078) including nodular smooth-muscle proliferation in renal arteries and arterioles, endothelial metaplasia, ectopic epithelial proliferation, and embryonal hyperplasia of Bowman's capsule. The stimulus to proliferative activity could be related to prolonged exposure to toxic metabolites.Dr. Wallace F. Buttrick: Are the cysts large enough to be identified by ultrasound study?Dr. Gang: In the prospective study of 96 patients in Japan to which I referred[73](#core-r073) cysts 5 mm or greater in diameter were detected by CT scans.Dr. Scully: Dr. Kassirer, do you have any final statement about this case?Dr. Kassirer: In my conclusion I pointed out that a sequential evaluation of the patient's findings as the case evolved provides an opportunity to expose faults and omissions in diagnostic reasoning. I shall use this opportunity to examine the faults and omissions in my discussion.I raised the possibility of renal cysts both before and after the results of the arteriographic examination were known. Was it appropriate to exclude renal cysts simply because cysts had not been demonstrated on previous intravenous urograms? Obviously not, but I was not aware of the occurrence of acquired renal cysts in patients on dialysis, and my search through the literature for causes of spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding in uremic patients failed to uncover that possibility. After the arteriographic findings were shown I cautiously said, \"Cystic kidneys are rarely associated with bleeding into the flank.\" In fact, the arteriographers apparently also did not consider renal cysts as a possible explanation of either the bleeding or the patchy renal visualization in this case except in retrospect. I believe that they, too, would have considered them more seriously if they had been aware that this entity exists. Thus, there were two diagnostic errors. One was the failure to include this entity as an a priori cause of bleeding in a patient on dialysis, and the other was the failure to consider it when the arteriograms were being interpreted. Even though making a precise diagnosis in this case was of little or no importance to the patient's outcome, careful dissection of the diagnostic process identifies exactly what went wrong. What have we learned from this experience? We have learned that if we ever encounter a uremic patient with bleeding from the kidney we should consider acquired cystic disease as a possible cause, and if an arteriographic study is done in such a case we should assess whether the vascular pattern is consistent with cystic degeneration. With the enlarging population of patients on dialysis this lesson is an important one.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Andrew Courtwright\n(Medicine): A 34-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of diarrhea and weakness.\nThree days before admission, weakness developed in the patient's right hand, followed by increasing weakness in the left hand. During the next 2 days, weakness progressively involved the whole body, limiting the patient's ability to walk, and was associated with diffuse muscle pain, episodic vomiting, and multiple episodes of diarrhea. He became bedridden and required assistance with activities of daily living. He was brought to the emergency department at this hospital.\nThe patient had had diarrhea for 6 months, which had reportedly begun after he drank \u201cdirty water\u201d when snowbound in northern New England. Stools were foul-smelling and intermittently watery or soft, without blood or mucus, and were associated with transient midepigastric pain; stool frequency had increased since the onset of symptoms to up to 10 times per day. Episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis had occurred once or twice daily for the previous month. He reported losing 27 kg of weight during that time, from his usual weight of 82 kg. He did not have fever, chills, night sweats, headache, chest pain, visual changes, shortness of breath, cough, urinary symptoms, numbness, or tingling. Four years earlier, he had had a prolonged period of recurrent diarrhea, which had resolved spontaneously and was not as severe as the present illness. He had fractured his arm in the past and his nose after a motor vehicle accident 5 months previously. He did not take any medications, had not sought medical attention for his illness because of religious beliefs, and had no known drug allergies. He was born in Brazil, had moved to the northeastern United States 8 years earlier, and lived with friends in coastal New England. He was sexually active with men and women, including a partner who was positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The patient had a history of alcohol abuse and occasional illicit drug use (cocaine and marijuana); he reported stopping alcohol consumption 6 months earlier and stopping smoking 1.5 years before moving to the United States. He had consumed unpasteurized milk and dairy products and raw fish and meat approximately 6 months before presentation. There was no exposure to sick contacts or animals. He traveled in Brazil and the northeastern United States only. It is not known when he last visited Brazil. Several relatives had had cancer; there was no family history of diarrheal illnesses.\nOn examination, the patient was alert and appeared ill and emaciated. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, the pulse 148 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry. There was a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. Bowel sounds were hyperactive, and the abdomen was soft, with suprapubic tenderness and no organomegaly or rebound. Grasp strength was 1 out of 5, and strength of the biceps, wrist and finger flexors and extensors, arm abductors, and leg muscles was 0 out of 5. Deep-tendon reflexes were absent, and the plantar reflexes were flexor; the remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram revealed supraventricular tachycardia with atrial and ventricular rates of 131 beats per minute, with diffuse, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities; the QT interval was 276 msec, with a QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) of 407 msec. Laboratory-test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. A stool specimen was guaiac-negative, and a chest radiograph was normal. Continuous cardiac monitoring was begun. Intravenous crystalloid and supplements of potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and sodium phosphate were administered; oral potassium chloride was also given. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU), and oral intake was restricted to medications only. The level of serum thyrotropin was 6.7 \u03bcU per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 5.0) and free thyroxine 0.9 ng per deciliter (11.6 pmol per liter) (reference range, 0.9 to 1.8 ng per deciliter [11.6 to 23.2 pmol per liter]). Testing for hepatitis B and C viruses was negative, and levels of methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin were normal.\nDuring the day of admission, laboratory tests were repeated every 2 to 3 hours; additional test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Urinalysis revealed a pH of 6.0 (reference range, 5.0 to 9.0), 2+ occult blood, trace albumin, and mucin; it was otherwise normal. Radiographs of the abdomen showed a mild dilatation of the small bowel, probably representative of a small-bowel ileus, with a suggestion of free air in the right upper quadrant. Cumulative stool output was 1600 ml during the first 11 hours, and urine output was 1600 ml; cumulative intravenous and oral intake was 2900 ml.\nOn the morning of the second day, analysis of a stool specimen revealed a sodium level of 87 mmol per liter, a potassium level of 50.6 mmol per liter, osmolality of 271 mOsm per kilogram of water, and 33% fat (reference range, <20). The CD4+ T-cell count was 125 per cubic millimeter of blood.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n*Dr. Edward T. Ryan:* May we review the imaging studies?*Dr. Carmel G. Cronin:* A plain-film radiograph of the abdomen obtained in the emergency department while the patient was in the supine position shows diffuse, mild small-bowel dilatation without a transition point. The large bowel is not dilated. These features may be consistent with an ileus. An extraluminal lucency in the right upper quadrant is worrisome for free air ([Figure 1A](#f01)). Ideally, a plain-film radiograph would be performed, with the patient in an erect position, to confirm the presence of free air, but in this case the patient was too debilitated to stand. The spine and the sacroiliac joints appear normal. There are no gallstones or calcification in the pancreatic region.With the patient in a supine position, a second abdominal radiograph obtained 2 days later shows similar findings of prominent small bowel and a suggestion of free air in the right upper quadrant. On the same day, a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen was obtained, which shows prominent small bowel, filled with gas and fluid, without a focal obstructing lesion, features consistent with an ileus. The large bowel is not dilated. There is no free air ([Figure 1B](#f01)). A chest radiograph taken with the patient in the supine position was normal.*Dr. Ryan:* This 34-year-old man presented with weakness to the point of paralysis. The patient reported no numbness or tingling; however, he reported muscle pain, and deep-tendon reflexes were absent. Initial considerations in the emergency department should have included severe peripheral neuropathy (e.g., the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome), drug effects, intoxication, and neuromuscular conditions such as the Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Although paresthesias of hands and feet are common in patients with the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, diffuse muscle pain would be atypical. This patient was emaciated and reported chronic diarrhea of at least 6 months' duration, with up to 10 voluminous bowel movements a day, resulting in the loss of more than 30% of his body weight. It is important to determine whether the weakness and paralysis are direct manifestations of an intestinal infection. Although there are examples of intestinal infections with neurologic manifestations ([Table 2](#t02)), none of the classic pathogens seem likely in this case. I suspect that the most likely cause of this patient's weakness is malabsorption and electrolyte loss due to chronic diarrhea.\n### Chronic Diarrhea\n\nFurther evaluation of this case should be focused on elucidating the nature of the chronic diarrhea. Is the intestinal process inflammatory or noninflammatory? We are told that the patient had no history of fever and that there was no blood in the stool, features that would strongly suggest a noninflammatory intestinal process. Noninflammatory diarrhea can be categorized as secretory or osmotic, and the stool osmolality of 271 mOsm per kilogram of water would be consistent with a secretory process.[1](#core-r001) This patient also has a number of features that are consistent with malabsorption, including 33% fecal fat (normal range, <20%), anemia with thrombocytosis (suggesting iron deficiency), an elevated prothrombin time (suggesting vitamin K deficiency), a low-normal serum albumin level (consistent with protein loss or poor synthesis), and low total blood calcium and phosphorus levels. These features would be consistent with malabsorption of fat, vitamins, and micronutrients. Carbohydrate malabsorption may also be present; however, the most striking laboratory abnormality is severe hypokalemia.\n### Hypokalemia\n\nHypokalemia may be due to poor intake; excessive losses through the intestine, kidneys, or skin; and redistribution of potassium stores to the intracellular environment. This patient's hypokalemia was probably multifactorial. He was losing potassium through his diarrhea and vomiting, he was perhaps losing potassium in his urine in the context of vomiting-associated bicarbonate loss and volume contraction, and he probably had poor intake because of recurrent vomiting. Hypokalemia (and hyperkalemia) can be associated with neuromuscular features ranging from weakness and muscle cramping to full paralysis[2\u20134](#core-r002); the mechanism of action is thought to be due to potassium-related alterations of nerve action potentials. Clinical features include weakness, ileus, electrocardiographic changes, and myopathy. Periodic hypokalemic paralysis should be considered in this patient; however, the chronic nature of his illness would argue against this entity.[3,5](#core-r003)\n### Intestinal Disorders That Cause Hypokalemia\n\nWhat are the most likely intestinal processes that could result in hypokalemia-associated paralysis in a patient with chronic, emaciating, voluminous, secretory, malabsorption diarrhea? Many infectious and noninfectious entities can cause chronic diarrhea ([Table 3](#t03)). [6](#core-r006) The lack of inflammatory markers would argue against inflammatory bowel disease. Short-bowel syndrome would be unlikely in the absence of previous abdominal surgery. Neuroendocrine tumors may present in a similar manner, but they are relatively rare. The diarrhea associated with laxative abuse is usually osmotic. Celiac disease is not usually as severe as this patient's illness. Although pancreatic insufficiency can present with a chronic malabsorptive diarrhea, the patient has no previous history of severe pancreatitis, there are no calcifications on abdominal imaging of the pancreatic bed, and the patient does not have diabetes, although endocrine and exocrine function can be disparate. The degree of illness in this patient would be highly atypical for lactose intolerance as a single diagnosis. Similarly, the onset of tropical sprue 8 years after immigrating to the United States would be highly unusual.There are no clinical features suggestive of motility disorders or syndromes associated with the malabsorption of bile salts, and Brainerd's diarrhea, an entity of undetermined cause, has classically been defined in epidemic situations. Postinfectious enteropathy and irritable bowel syndrome are possible, but we are not given a history of an inciting event, and the voluminous nature of the diarrhea with an absence of severe cramping and alternating periods of constipation make this unlikely. Microscopic colitis can present with a chronic secretory diarrhea, but malabsorption would be rare. [7](#core-r007) Another entity to at least consider in a patient with diarrhea and neurologic changes would be pellagra due to niacin deficiency, but the peripheral neuropathy and absence of a classic dermatitis effectively rule out that diagnosis.[8](#core-r008)Infectious causes of chronic diarrhea are usually protozoal, although bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine should be considered, as should chronic *Clostridium difficile* colitis and campylobacteriosis, but the absence of blood and inflammatory markers in the stool strongly argue against these latter diagnoses. Infection with microsporidia can result in chronic diarrhea, although usually in persons who have advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or who are severely immunocompromised with other cell-mediated deficiencies.[9](#core-r009) Similarly, chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis, leishmaniasis, and cystoisosporiasis (formerly known as isosporiasis) could also result in a wasting illness and chronic diarrheal process, but this patient's degree of illness would usually be seen in persons with compromised cellular immunity, such as those with advanced HIV infection,[10](#core-r010) although *Cystoisospora belli* (also known as *Isospora belli*) infection can cause chronic diarrhea in immunocompetent persons. However, in immunocompetent persons with chronic cystoisosporiasis, peripheral eosinophilia is often present, a feature that this patient does not have. Intestinal amebiasis and balantidiasis can also cause chronic diarrhea, but the absence of blood in the stool or intestinal markers of inflammation in this patient argue against these diagnoses. Chronic giardiasis caused by *Giardia lamblia* should be seriously considered in this patient, since it can cause chronic secretory diarrhea with malabsorption and does not require an underlying immunocompromised state.[11](#core-r011)Which of these is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? A fundamental question is whether we think he is severely immunocompromised, in particular with an immunodeficiency affecting cellular immunity, such as that seen in chronic HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection. We know that he has a very low CD4+ T-cell count, has had sexual encounters with an HIV-positive person, has an emaciating chronic illness, and was admitted with a moderately elevated serum globulin level. All these features are consistent with advanced HIV-1 infection. However, a peripheral white-cell count of 18,000 to 22,600 per cubic millimeter and a platelet count of 485,000 per cubic millimeter are somewhat atypical in persons with advanced HIV infection.Therefore, I would consider two approaches in generating a final differential diagnosis. Although a number of intestinal infections have been associated with hypokalemic paralysis, including giardia, salmonella, yersinia, strongyloides, and cystoisospora,[12\u201316](#core-r012) if the patient does not have HIV infection, I think the most likely diagnosis is giardiasis. However, giardiasis of this severity would suggest an underlying immunoglobulin deficiency, since hypogammaglobulinemia is associated with severe, recalcitrant, and relapsing giardiasis.[17](#core-r017) An absence of previous head and neck or airway infection argues against an IgA deficiency, and the elevated serum globulin level argues against panhypogammaglobulinemia.If this patient is infected with HIV, I think the leading diagnoses would be intestinal cryptosporidiosis, cystoisosporiasis, leishmaniasis, or microsporidiosis. All these intestinal infections can result in severe and chronic intestinal diarrheal processes. Of these, cystoisosporiasis has been associated with hypokalemic paralysis in an HIV-infected person.[16](#core-r016)We are left with the reality that none of these infections are classically associated with peripheral leukocytosis or thrombocytosis, features present in this case. The thrombocytosis may reflect a chronic infection, inflammatory state, and perhaps iron-deficiency anemia. The leukocytosis may reflect a tiny intestinal perforation that could be associated with the severe ileus and could be suggested by the radiographic finding of possible free intraperitoneal air. Although intestinal perforation is not a typical feature of any of these infections, there is one case report of intestinal perforation in an HIV-infected patient with microsporidiosis.[18](#core-r018)\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, I believe that this patient has hypokalemia-associated paralysis due to a chronic intestinal protozoal or microsporidial infection \u2014 either severe giardiasis if he is not infected with HIV and has a deficiency in an immunoglobulin subtype, or intestinal cystoisosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, or leishmaniasis if he is HIV-infected. All these infections can result in severe and chronic intestinal diarrheal processes. Cystoisospora has been associated with hypokalemic paralysis in an HIV-infected person,[16](#core-r016) so it would possibly be the leading choice if this patient is HIV-infected. How should we proceed?Because of the possibility of an intestinal perforation, I would recommend initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics, including metronidazole. I would replenish potassium parenterally and minimize oral food intake to minimize insulin secretion in the short-term and avoid exacerbation of potassium shifts. I would also replenish other electrolytes, including magnesium, and would hydrate the patient and monitor him carefully.To make a diagnosis, I would test for anti-HIV antibodies. I would also examine a stool specimen for ova and parasites, using acid-fast stains, trichrome stain, and immunofluorescence assays for intestinal protozoa and microsporidia and antigen-detection assays for giardia and cryptosporidia. If these tests are unrevealing, I would repeat the stool studies and perform additional serologic assays, including assessment for anti-gliadin antibodies. If the workup is again unrevealing, I would proceed to additional imaging and endoscopy after clinical stabilization of the patient.*Dr. Eric S. Rosenberg* (Pathology): Dr. Courtwright, would you give us your initial clinical impression of this patient?*Dr. Courtwright:* In view of the patient's history and clinical presentation, we thought he might have advanced HIV infection; therefore, we favored a diagnosis of chronic diarrhea with infectious causes, particularly microsporidia, cystoisospora, cryptosporidia, giardia, and *Entamoeba histolytica*.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. John A. Branda:* Testing for HIV infection was performed on admission to this hospital. An enzyme immunoassay was positive for antibodies against HIV-1 or HIV-2. A Western blot analysis for HIV-1 was also positive and revealed a mature antibody response. This confirmed the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection. In addition, testing for HIV RNA revealed a viral load of 334,000 copies per milliliter of plasma, independently verifying the diagnosis.A stool specimen collected on hospital day 2 was examined for ova and parasites and revealed the cause of the patient's protracted diarrhea. *C. belli* oocysts were detected in a wet preparation after the stool specimen had been concentrated with the use of the formalin\u2013ethyl acetate technique ([Figure 2A](#f02)). The finding was confirmed by examination of a smear treated with a modified acid-fast stain ([Figure 2B](#f02)), which highlights the oocysts, and by observation of the correct morphologic features after oocyst maturation in a potassium dichromate solution ([Figure 2C](#f02)).Cystoisospora is distributed worldwide, but infections are most common in tropical and subtropical areas ([www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/html/cystoisosporiasis.htm](https://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/html/cystoisosporiasis.htm)). It is acquired through the fecal\u2013oral route. Although our patient reported consuming \u201cdirty water\u201d before the onset of diarrhea, this exposure took place in northern New England, a region in which the organism is uncommon. It is more likely that the infection was acquired during a visit to his native Brazil; it is not known how recently the patient had traveled there. One could also consider the possibility that infection was acquired before immigration and reactivated after immunosuppression. Recurrence of latent infection has been proposed as one possible explanation for the higher prevalence of cystoisospora among immigrants with AIDS than among U.S.-born persons with AIDS.[20](#core-r020) However, the organism infects principally the intestinal epithelium, which undergoes rapid turnover and is therefore unlikely to serve as a long-term reservoir for latent organisms.[20](#core-r020) Sexual transmission through oral\u2013anal contact has also been suggested[21](#core-r021) but seems unlikely, since oocysts excreted in stool are usually immature and must exist outside the host for 1 or 2 days before becoming infective.*Dr. Rosenberg:* Dr. Upshaw, would you tell us what happened with the patient?*Dr. Jenica N. Upshaw* (Medicine): The patient was admitted to the medical ICU. Potassium was aggressively replenished, and his weakness resolved. He was initially treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, and once the results of the analysis of the stool for ova and parasites were available, treatment was narrowed to trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. The diarrhea decreased during the next 5 or 6 days, and he was then transferred out of the ICU. The hospital course was complicated by deep-vein thrombosis associated with a peripherally inserted central catheter, urinary tract infection with klebsiella species, and hospital-acquired pneumonia, but the patient eventually recovered and was discharged after 11 days in the hospital. He was followed by the infectious disease service while in the hospital, and the plan was to continue treatment with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and to initiate HIV therapy on an outpatient basis during the next 2 weeks. Unfortunately, he did not come to his follow-up appointments. After multiple telephone calls, he said he did not want additional medical care. Because of his religious beliefs, he preferred to pursue alternative therapies.Four months later, the patient was readmitted with fever, weakness in the right arm, and an expressive aphasia. He was found to have a ring-enhancing lesion in the basal ganglia on the left side and midline shift, presumably due to toxoplasmosis. After treatment for toxoplasmosis, the aphasia and weakness improved. After discharge, antiretroviral therapy was initiated. At the last follow-up, the patient was taking his medicine and his CD4+ T-cell count was 233 per cubic millimeter.*Dr. Hasan Bazari* (Medicine): The degree of ileus was quite prominent; do you think it can be ascribed only to the intestinal infection, or was it a component of the hypokalemia?*Dr. Ryan:* I suspect the ileus was caused mainly by profound hypokalemia.\n",

      "question": "First admission\n. A 67-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of Wegener's granulomatosis.\nShe was well until three and a half months earlier, when she began to have pleuritic pain, malaise, anorexia and a sensation of fullness in the area of the paranasal sinuses. A physician prescribed tetracycline and codeine, without improvement. One month later she began to complain of \"shooting pains\" on both sides of the abdomen. She came to the hospital, where examination disclosed no abnormality except that the temperature was 37.8\u00b0C. X-ray films of the chest (\nFig. 1\n) showed an irregular apical consolidation on the right side, with a suggestion of cavitation; nodular opacities were seen in the lateral costophrenic sulci; the remaining portions of the lungs, the heart and the mediastinum appeared normal. Three days later she returned to the hospital because of a cough productive of scanty yellow sputum; the physical examination revealed no change. The urine gave a trace-positive test for protein; the sediment contained numerous red cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 34.3 per cent, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 123 mm per hour. A culture of urine yielded a growth of enterococci. The fingers, ankles and elbows became painful and stiff.\nNine weeks before admission she returned to the hospital because of a herpetic lesion on the lip; examination showed no other change. The urine gave a ++ test for protein; the sediment contained 10 white cells and 25 red cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 33.4 per cent, and the white-cell count 13,700. The urine gave a negative test for Bence-Jones protein. X-ray films of the chest demonstrated definite evidence of cavitation in the consolidated area in the right-upper-lung field, associated with a focus that appeared calcified; densities in the costophrenic angles and a faint, irregular area of consolidation in the left apex were also noted. Skin tests with mumps antigen and PPD (5 TU) were negative. Another culture of urine yielded a growth of enterococci; ampicillin was prescribed. Two days before admission purpuric lesions appeared on the ankles and progressed proximally.\nThe temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 80, and the respirations 15. The blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared sallow and chronically ill. Palpable purpuric lesions were present on the upper and lower extremities. A few rales were heard at the right-lung apex. The urine gave a ++++ test for protein; the sediment contained innumerable red cells. The hematocrit was 24.5 per cent; the white-cell count was 13,000, with 85 per cent neutrophils. The platelet count was 504,000, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 124 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen was 94 mg, the creatinine 9.4 mg, the calcium 7.7 mg, the phosphorus 10 mg, and the protein 6.5 g (the albumin 1.6 g, and the globulin 4.9 g) per 100 ml. The sodium was 131 meq, the potassium 5.7 meq, the chloride 95 meq, and the carbon dioxide 19 meq per liter. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing room air, showed that the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO\n2\n) was 87 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO\n2\n) 29 mm Hg, and the pH 7.44. Microscopical examination of a Gram-stained specimen of sputum disclosed a small number of neutrophils; no bacteria or acid-fast bacilli were seen. An electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal rhythm at a rate of 80; the PR interval was 0.22 second, and the QRS interval 0.14 second; the axis was -30\u00b0; the pattern of left-bundle-branch block was present. X-ray films of the chest were unchanged except that views obtained in both lateral decubitus positions showed a small right pleural effusion. A film of the abdomen was normal aside from a question of enlargement of the left renal outline. Films of the paranasal sinuses disclosed slight mucosal thickening of the left maxillary antrum. An infusion pyelographic examination showed slight prominence of the midlateral border of the left kidney. A culture of urine yielded a growth of\nEscherichia coli\n, and a culture of sputum grew a normal throat flora. A direct Coombs test, a test for antinuclear antibodies and a serologic test for syphilis were negative. Skin tests with streptokinase-streptodornase and with PPD (5 TU) were negative. A biopsy of a purpuric skin lesion revealed necrotizing vasculitis. A percutaneous needle biopsy of the kidney showed severe necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescents and granulomatous arteritis; electromicroscopical examination of a fluoresceinstained specimen disclosed deposits of C3 and fibrin in the crescents.\nExtracorporeal hemodialysis was begun, and cyclophosphamide was administered in a dose that ranged from 150 to 250 mg daily; after 10 days the renal function improved, but neutropenia developed, and cyclophosphamide was discontinued. Gentamicin was given. The neutropenia improved, and cyclophosphamide was resumed in a dose of 50 mg daily, with prednisone, 20 mg daily. The patient lost 6 kg in weight. Epistaxis occurred twice and was treated with anterior packs. Another x-ray film of the chest revealed the development of new areas of faint opacity in the peripheral portions of both upper lobes. Shortly before discharge the urine gave a ++ test for protein; the sediment contained innumerable red cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 20 per cent; the white-cell count was 4900, with 62 per cent neutrophils; the platelet count was 210,000. The urea nitrogen was 51 mg, and the creatinine 3.3 mg per 100 ml. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, and the patient was discharged on the 39th hospital day on cyclophosphamide, 50 mg daily, and prednisone, 10 mg every other day.\nSecond admission\n(one month later). The patient felt stronger, and her weight was stable. Three days before admission she returned to the clinic, where an x-ray film of the chest (\nFig. 2\n) showed a reduction in the extent of the consolidation that surrounded the lesion in the right upper lobe and in the densities at both costophrenic angles; the peripheral opacities in the upper lobes were replaced by a diffuse reticulonodular abnormality; the heart and mediastinum again appeared normal. Cyclophosphamide and prednisone were discontinued, and the patient was readmitted.\nThere was a 60-pack-year history of cigarette smoking. The patient denied recent chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, chills, fever, night sweats, allergies, travel and exposure to toxic chemicals or asbestos.\nThe temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 100, and the respirations 28. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient appeared frail and chronically ill. No purpuric lesions or peripheral lymphadenopathy was found. A few atelectatic rales were heard at the base of the right lung.\nThe urine gave a + test for protein; the sediment contained innumerable white cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 25.7 per cent; the white-cell count was 6200, with 62 per cent neutrophils, 4 per cent band forms, 18 per cent lymphocytes, 11 per cent monocytes, 2 per cent eosinophils, 1 per cent basophils and 2 per cent metamyelocytes. The platelet count was 405,000, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 125 mm per hour. The prothrombin time was 11.3 seconds, with a control of 10.8 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 29 seconds. The urea nitrogen was 19 mg, the glucose 68 mg, the bilirubin 0.4 mg, the calcium 8.9 mg, the phosphorus 3.5 mg, the cortisol 16 \u03bcg, and the protein 7.2 g (the albumin 3.0 g, and the globulin 4.2 g) per 100 ml. The sodium was 136 meq, the potassium 4.8 meq, the chloride 104 meq, and the carbon dioxide 23 meq per liter. The glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) was 10 U, the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 200 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 4.3 Bodansky U. An electrocardiogram and x-ray films of the chest were unchanged. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing room air, disclosed that the PaO\n2\nwas 77 mm Hg, the PaCO\n2\n30 mm Hg, and the pH 7.47. A culture of urine yielded an abundant growth of\nEsch. coli\n; a culture of sputum gave a growth of normal throat flora. Pulmonary-function studies were performed (\nTable 1\n).\nThe patient was given a preparation of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. On the sixth hospital day an x-ray film of the chest showed that the diffuse reticulonodular abnormality persisted; the apical and costophrenic densities appeared smaller than on earlier studies; the right apical cavity was unchanged.\nOn the ninth hospital day a diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",

Greene: A film of the chest taken 2 1/2 months before admission ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows an irregular area of consolidation at the apex of the right lung, with a suggestion of cavitation. A focal density elsewhere in the upper lobe raises the possibility of calcification. A few small, irregular areas are visible in other parts of the right upper lobe and in the left apex. At both costophrenic sulci there are peripheral pulmonary densities similar to the lesion at the right apex. No pleural abnormality is seen. Another film of the chest, obtained nine weeks before admission, again shows the right apical consolidation, with confirmation of the presence of a cavity within it. A few small irregular densities are visible adjacent to the consolidation. The lesions in the left apex and in both costophrenic sulci are unchanged.A film of the chest taken on the first admission demonstrates no change from the previous examination except for the appearance of a right pleural effusion. X-ray studies of the paranasal sinuses disclose very slight mucous-membrane thickening in the left maxillary antrum. A film of the abdomen reveals slight fullness of the left renal outline. A subsequent intravenous pyelogram shows that the fullness was secondary to fetal lobulation. An x-ray film of the chest taken on the 13th hospital day shows no change of importance. Films obtained on the second admission ([Fig. 2](#f002)) demonstrate a marked change in the appearance of the lungs. The lesions in the right apex and costophrenic sulci are partially resolved, but new diffuse, irregular reticular and nodular densities are evident. The reticular densities predominate. The lung volumes are similar to those observed in the previous studies.Dr. Levine: I have several questions to ask the physicians responsible for the patient's care. First of all, how severe was the neutropenia when the cyclophosphamide therapy was discontinued?Dr. Jerome E. Groopman: She had a total white-cell count as low as 1000, with 25 per cent neutrophils.Dr. Levine: Was there any evidence of infection at that time?Dr. Groopman: She had a urinary-tract infection due to *Esch. coli*.Dr. Levine: What was the temporal relation between the onset of the cyclophosphamide therapy and the x-ray film at the time of the second admission that showed the appearance of a reticular infiltrate?Dr. Groopman: There was an interval of approximately three weeks.Dr. Levine: When you saw the patient before the second admission did she have any symptoms?Dr. Groopman: No. The admission was prompted by the appearance of the x-ray films.Dr. Levine: It is important to note that the abnormality demonstrated on the x-ray films was a predominantly reticular infiltrate, with relatively little nodularity. A second important feature of the case is that the patient had a fairly normal white-cell count despite the cyclophosphamide therapy and was asymptomatic when this change appeared on the x-ray films.In 1936 Wegener[1](#core-r001) reported several cases of necrotizing granulomas of the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with necrotizing glomerulonephritis. The disease designated by his name is now characterized by the triad of necrotizing granulomas of both the upper and the lower respiratory tracts, a necrotizing glomerulonephritis and varying degrees of disseminated arteritis. There is no doubt that this patient had all the components of that triad, and I shall take the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis at face value.The mean age at onset of this rare disease is 40 years, and the male-female ratio is 2:1. The patients usually present with rhinorrhea, sinusitis, nasal mucosal ulceration, epistaxis, otitis media and conjunctivitis, but occasionally there are manifestations of pulmonary disease, such as cough, hemoptysis or discomfort in the chest. In the upper airway the maxillarysinuses are the most commonly affected and often the site of secondary infection with *Staphylococcus aureus*. X-ray films of the chest frequently show cavitary infiltrates and nodules 1 to 9 cm in diameter. The infiltrates are often fleeting, and calcification is not seen. When there is diffuse involvement of the lungs the radiologic appearance of the infiltrate is nodular rather than reticular. Thin-wall cavities can result, mimicking coccidioidomycosis. One characteristic that differentiates Wegener's granulomatosis from neoplastic nodules is progression of the lesions in one area of the lung with spontaneous regression of those elsewhere.[2](#core-r002)In the past the disseminated form of Wegener's granulomatosis with renal involvement has been invariably fatal. The patients who were treated with prednisone sometimes improved transiently, but the disease remained fatal. In recent years cytotoxic drugs have proved to be more effective. Israel and Patchefsky[3](#core-r003) reported that chlorambucil, a relatively mild cytotoxic agent, was successful in 50 per cent of a series of cases of Wegener's granulomatosis. The treatment lasted for approximately six months, with few or no toxic complications, and after its cessation there was no relapse. However, in five of the seven patients successfully treated the disease was confined to the lung. When there is dissemination with renal failure as a prominent feature recent experience has shown that cyclophosphamide is the drug of choice.[4](#core-r004) This drug given orally at a dose of 2 to 5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day resulted in improvement after two to three weeks and long-term remissions of up to 10 years. Complications such as infection were minimal if the white-cell count was not allowed to fall below 3000 and steroid therapy was not given concomitantly. Therefore, I believe that the use of cyclophosphamide for this patient, who presented with renal failure, was appropriate.Despite the obvious improvement in the renal disease and the regression of the lung lesions a new pulmonary abnormality appeared \u2014 namely, a diffuse reticular infiltrate. The physiologic data obtained at that time included evidence of a moderate obstructive defect consistent with the patient's 60-pack-year history of smoking. However, the severity of some of the abnormalities is more compatible with an interstitial process than obstructive airways disease. These abnormalities include the resting PaCO2 of 29 mm Hg, indicating hyperventilation, the increased gradient between alveolar and arterial partial pressures of oxygen, the modest fall in the PaO2 during exercise and the steady-state carbon dioxide diffusing capacity, which was approximately 25 per cent of the predicted value. The earliest changes in lung function in patients with interstitial disease occur in the pulmonary gas exchange, with hypoxemia on exercise one of the first manifestations. Typically, the arterial blood in patients with interstitial lung disease has a diminished PaO2, a normal or low PaCO2, as in this case, and a normal or alkaline pH. These abnormalities may precede other changes in lung function.This patient had a normal total lung capacity. Pathologic alterations of lung compliance, lung volume, diffusing surface and blood flow in interstitial disease may combine to produce an abnormal ventilation-perfusion ratio, accounting for most of the gas-exchange abnormalities observed. Patients with interstitial lung disease often have a PaO2 of less than 80 mm Hg and an increase in the alveolar-arterial gradient while they are breathing room air even if the lung volumes are normal. In addition to hypoxemia, hyperventilation with resultant respiratory alkalosis is a common feature in patients with this type of lung disease. The hyperventilation is partly due to hypoxemia, with increased hypoxic drive to ventilation through stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors, but is mainly due to alterations in the lung interstitium. The stretch receptors in the lung are stimulated by the interstitial process, leading to sustained hyperventilation even when oxygen is given to abolish the hypoxic drive. This patient had marked hyperventilation, with a PaCO2 of 29 mm Hg and a well compensated pH, despite the fact that she had an adequate arterial oxygen content.The diffusing capacity of the lung for oxygen or carbon monoxide is also diminished in patients with interstitial lung disease. This reduction has been interpreted as indicating the presence of a barrier to the passage of oxygen through the alveolar-capillary membrane because of its increased thickness. The term \"alveolar-capillary block\" was coined to describe the basic pathophysiologic process. However, recent evidence suggests that a block to diffusion of oxygen is not the cause of hypoxemia in most cases of interstitial lung disease. The effect of an increase in the thickness of the membrane on the diffusion of oxygen can be calculated. The membrane thickness can be increased to six to eight times the normal before there is a 1 mm Hg increase in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. Therefore, an increase in the membrane thickness itself has a minor role in the pathogenesis of hypoxemia in patients with interstitial lung disease.Another feature of interstitial lung disease is the development of hypoxemia on exercise, which may indeed antedate the onset of resting hypoxemia. During exercise the cardiac output and oxygen consumption increase, and as a result of the increased cardiac output the red-cell transit time through the pulmonary capillary bed is decreased. Since the size of the capillary bed is reduced in patients with interstitial lung disease the decreased transit time of the red cells does not permit adequate equilibration of mixed venous blood with alveolar oxygen, resulting in hypoxemia. Therefore, from the physiologic data given in this case I must conclude that the patient had a diffuse interstitial process at the time of the second admission.Interstitial lung disease can be classified on the basis of the underlying pathologic changes or the type of associated systemic disease. In some cases the disorder has an environmental cause. In every case a thorough history of all occupational and environmental exposures, a family history and a complete review of systems are needed. Any physical abnormality must be viewed as a possible associated manifestation of a systemic disorder causing interstitial lung disease. The diagnostic evaluation should also include both biochemical and radiologic evaluation of the patient. When a clear cause of the lung disease is not found a closed or open lung biopsy should be performed.The causes of interstitial pulmonary disease may be divided into extrinsic and intrinsic categories. The first extrinsic cause to be considered is a drug, which is a distinct possibility in this case since the patient had been treated with cyclophosphamide. Numerous drugs, including cyclophosphamide,[5](#core-r005) have been documented as a cause of interstitial pneumonitis. There are inherited forms of interstitial pneumonitis. I have recently seen identical twins who presented with interstitial pneumonia at 50 years of age. Other inherited disorders that may be associated with interstitial pneumonitis are von Recklinghausen's disease and tuberous sclerosis. Radiation therapy to the chest may result in interstitial pneumonitis. The diffuse reticular form of the disease has been found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis and periarteritis nodosa, but in cases of Wegener's granulomatosis the type of interstitial process is nodular rather than reticular. Other diseases in which there is vascular involvement, such as Goodpasture's syndrome and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, can lead to pulmonary fibrosis. Diseases of environmental origin, such as hypersensitivity lung diseases, including farmer's lung, can also be associated with a diffuse interstitial process. Changes secondary to cardiac disease, such as mitral stenosis, often mimic interstitial pneumonitis. Pneumoconiosis must also be considered, although we have a negative occupational history in this case. Exposure to noxious gases is another possibility to be raised.Both the appearance of the changes on the x-ray films and the clinical course in this case are compatible with drug-induced pulmonary disease. Various cytotoxic agents have been implicated. Bleomycin results in pulmonary toxic manifestations in 2 to 46 per cent of the patients who receive the drug and is related to the total dose given,[6](#core-r006) and the process may be reversed by discontinuance of the drug. Methotrexate may also cause a diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, depending on the frequency and the route of its administration rather than the dose administered. The frequency of this complication is markedly increased when the medication is given intravenously. Pulmonary lesions can occur after long-term busulfan therapy, becoming evident four to 10 years after the onset of the administration of the drug. One interesting feature of busulfan-induced interstitial pneumonitis is that the sputum often contains atypical malignant-appearing cells, and despite withdrawal of the drug the pulmonary toxicity continues, with death as a result.Cyclophosphamide, an excellent alkylating agent in the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis, has resulted in interstitial pneumonitis.[4](#core-r004) Pathological examination has revealed atypicality of the alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary fibrosis in the three reported cases of that association that I could find. One patient was treated for 27 months with cyclophosphamide taken orally, and another received the drug intravenously. The third patient had associated diseases that could have been responsible for the interstitial pneumonitis. In none of the cases was the onset as rapid as it was in this case. The pathological findings in cases of interstitial pneumonitis ascribed to cyclophosphamide therapy have included marked atypia of the bronchial and alveolar epithelium. The cells have varied in size and shape and have often contained bizarre nuclei, similar to those found in patients who received busulfan therapy.We can be fairly certain of two features of this case \u2014 namely, the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis and the recent onset of an interstitial process. Because of the temporal relation of the latter to the cyclophosphamide therapy and the absence of clues pointing to other causes of an interstitial process, such as infection, I believe that this woman had cyclophosphamide-induced interstitial pneumonitis. However, since the causal relation between the administration of the drug and the development of interstitial pneumonitis has not been clearly defined in the literature the diagnosis cannot be established solely on clinical grounds. If the pulmonary infiltrates regress after cessation of the therapy and reappear if one dares to resume it there would be fairly solid grounds for the diagnosis, but discontinuance followed by readministration of the drug is not justifiable clinically.The radiologic appearance of the pulmonary abnormality in this case is nonspecific. Pneumocystis, fungus and virus infections may produce protean changes demonstrable on x-ray films. However, in the reported cases of Wegener's granulomatosis treated with cyclophosphamide in which the white-cell counts have remained relatively normal infection was a rare complication.On the basis of the radiologic abnormalities, the clinical course and the physiologic data I conclude that the patient had interstitial pneumonitis secondary to cyclophosphamide therapy, but I cannot establish the causal relation. A lung biopsy was needed to exclude an infectious process, which cannot be ruled out with the data available.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Kazemi, do you wish to comment?*Dr. Homayoun Kazemi:* I think that a cyclophosphamide reaction is a reasonable explanation for the interstitial pneumonitis. However, in any patient treated with antimetabolites and Cytotoxic agents an opportunistic infection can occur, and in many cases a lung biopsy is needed to establish the diagnosis.Dr. Mark L. Rosenberg: Although a biopsy may have been necessary to identify the cause of the interstitial fibrosis, do you think that the results would affect the decision about further therapy for this patient?Dr. Levine: The therapeutic alternatives are relatively few in cases of this type. We are limited to two drugs \u2014 chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide. This patient obviously had severe, disseminated Wegener's granulomatosis, and with the development of an interstitial process the possibility that one of the drugs induced a potentially lethal progressive interstitial pneumonitis had to be excluded by a lung biopsy. If infection was demonstrated the choice of therapy could have been altered appropriately. I have no answer about the wisdom of resuming cyclophosphamide in this patient if it proved to be the cause of the pulmonary changes. If she had an exacerbation of the Wegener's granulomatosis after the withdrawal of cyclophosphamide I would have tried chlorambucil.Dr. Groopman: We believed that cyclophosphamide might be essential to prolong this woman's life, particularly in view of the renal failure. However, I think that the therapeutic options are a bit broader than those mentioned by Dr. Levine. Azathioprine has proved effective in the control of Wegener's granulomatosis in many cases.Dr. Matthew A. Miller: Dr. Levine, you commented that the reduction in steady-state diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide supported the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonitis. I wonder if anyone has investigated single-breath or steady-state diffusing capacities in cases of nodular Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Levine: In patients with diffuse nodular involvement of the lungs the physiologic alterations are indistinguishable from those of other interstitial processes.Dr. Scully: Dr. Schoolnik, what were the medical students' diagnoses?Dr. Gary K. Schoolnik: Dr. Bregman, who is medical chief resident at Southwestern Medical School, in Dallas, Texas, is the guest of the Medical Services this week. He discussed this case with the students and will give the diagnosis of the group.Dr. Richard M. Bregman: The students believed that the primary underlying diagnosis was Wegener's granulomatosis. To account for the reticulonodular pulmonary infiltrate they suggested three possible processes. Their first thought was Wegener's granulomatosis, which they excluded because of the improvement of the other systemic manifestations and the unusual character of the infiltrate demonstrated on the second admission. The second was an opportunistic infection, but they ruled out that possibility because of the patient's clinical well-being and the lack of hypoxemia. Their final diagnosis was cyclophosphamide-induced pneumonitis.Dr. Scully: Dr. Groopman, what was your pre-biopsy diagnosis?Dr. Groopman: I believed that she had interstitial pneumonitis secondary to the cyclophosphamide therapy.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Eugene J. Mark: The diagnostic procedure was an open biopsy of the right middle lobe. The lung tissue was firmer than normal. The microscopical examination revealed that it was involved by a diffuse panacinar interstitial pneumonitis ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The interalveolar septa were uniformly thickened by a lymphocytic infiltrate ([Fig. 4](#f004)), whereas the air spaces were devoid of cells except for a few scattered histiocytes. One respiratory bronchiole was the site of a bronchiolitis, with segmental denudation of its epithelium and an aggregation of neutrophils. A moderate increase in interstitial collagen and smooth muscle could be documented in subpleural areas, but such changes are difficult to interpret in biopsy specimens from the distal portion of the right middle lobe and lingula. There was no evidence of vasculitis, vascular obliteration or infarction. No intranuclear or intracellular viral inclusions were present, and special stains for fungi and *Pneumocystis carinii* failed to disclose any organisms. A striking feature was the presence of Type II pneumocytes lining the alveoli, and many of them were dysplastic. The nuclei were enlarged, hyperchromatic and occasionally convoluted, but the nuclear cytoplasmic ratio remained low (Fig. [4](#f004) and [5](#f005)), unlike that in malignant tumor cells. These nuclei were not as atypical as those seen in the busulfan lung but were comparable to those observed after therapy with bleomycin and methotrexate.Implication of a drug as a factor in the development of pneumonitis must be done with caution, particularly in regard to exclusion of an infectious cause in an immunosuppressed host.[6,7](#core-r006) Nevertheless, I believe that the histopathologic changes observed in this case should be attributed to the cyclophosphamide therapy. In reviewing the reported cases of cyclophosphamide pneumonitis one encounters examples of pulmonary disease that could be attributed to one or more agents besides the cyclophosphamide. However, in five reported cases[5,8\u201311](#core-r005) the primacy of cyclophosphamide in producing the pneumonitis seems adequately documented both clinically and pathologically, and I have recently seen another such case.[12](#core-r012) The duration of the therapy in cases of this type has ranged from one to 36 months, and in all those cases there was an interval of one or more months between the discontinuance of the drug and persistence or progression of respiratory distress sufficient to prompt an open-lung biopsy.[12](#core-r012)A virus was subsequently grown on culture of the lung-biopsy specimen. Dr. Hirsch, will you comment on the virologic finding?Dr. Martin S. Hirsch: Cytomegalovirus was isolated in a high titer from the specimen, and the patient had a concurrent marked rise in complement-fixation antibody to cytomegalovirus antigens from less than 1:8 to greater than 1:256. So there is no question about the diagnosis of active cytomegalovirus infection in the lung. How much it contributed to the pulmonary deterioration I don't know.Dr. Rosenberg: In our initial assessment of this patient we had estimated the likelihood of an infectious process as very low because she had no symptoms of infection. The finding of cytomegalovirus infection was quite a surprise. I agree with Dr. Hirsch that there is no way to know whether this infection contributed to the pulmonary process or was important in any other way. Such information can come only from a prospective study of pulmonary changes in persons on immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs with a correlation of such changes with the presence or absence of cytomegalovirus infection.Dr. Mark: Cytomegalovirus has been cultured from the lungs post mortem in eight of 69 (12 per cent) non-immunosuppressed patients who died of a wide variety of diseases. Cytomegalic cells containing inclusions were observed in only one of those cases.[13](#core-r013) In the same study 12 of 16 (75 per cent) renal-allograft recipients proved to have cytomegalovirus in the lungs, and in eight of the 12 cases viral inclusions were detected on microscopical examination.[13](#core-r013) Experimental work has shown that the cytomegalovirus can replicate and be identified by electronmicroscopical examination before viral inclusions are detectable with the light microscope. Under such circumstances a prominent intra-alveolar exudate accompanies the interstitial infiltrates. In human beings and animals most of the cytomegalovirus inclusions are found in the alveolar macrophages and not in the Type II pneumocytes.[14](#core-r014) Because of the probability of identifying the viral inclusions in lung tissue in immunosuppressed patients with cytomegalovirus infection,[13](#core-r013) the presence of dysplastic Type II pneumocytes without inclusions, the lack of an intra-alveolar exudate and the absence of intra-alveolar macrophages with inclusions I favor the interpretation that the histologic changes in the lung-biopsy specimen were due to cyclophosphamide rather than cytomegalovirus.Dr. Groopman: The patient is doing very well with nearly normal renal function two months after the biopsy. She is being treated with azathioprine for the Wegener's granulomatosis and received a short course of high-dose prednisone for the interstitial pneumonitis. X-ray films show complete resolution of the abnormalities in the lungs. It is interesting that the serologic titers for cytomegalovirus have remained elevated.Dr. Greene: The most recent x-ray films are almost completely normal. The fine reticulations have almost entirely disappeared. The lesions of Wegener's granulomatosis have left scars at the apex.Dr. Mark: Dr. Hirsch, how would you interpret the clinical and radiologic resolution in this patient, who required continued immunosuppression, if the cytomegalovirus was a pathogen rather than a saprophyte?Dr. Hirsch: I don't think that argues one way or the other. We have seen patients after renal transplantation with proved cytomegalovirus pneumonitis who have improved on continued immunosuppression.\n",

      "question": "Dr. Aida E. Kuri\n(Medicine): A 79-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of pain and weakness in the legs.\nThe patient had multiple medical problems but had been in his usual state of health until 6 days before admission, when progressive, generalized pain and tingling developed in both legs. Three days before admission, weakness in both legs developed and gradually worsened and he had difficulty walking. On the morning of admission, he was unable to get out of bed. His wife called emergency medical services, and he was brought to the emergency department at this hospital.\nThe patient had no fevers, chills, headache, chest pain, respiratory symptoms, nausea, vomiting, changes in bladder habits, rectal bleeding, or saddle anesthesia (loss of sensation in the area of the buttocks and perineum) and had no history of trauma, falls, contact with sick persons, or recent travel. Eight days before admission, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed because of iron-deficiency anemia, with the administration of meperidine and midazolam; multiple nonbleeding duodenal erosions were seen; testing for\nHelicobacter pylori\nwas negative. The patient had a long history of leg pain that was associated with activity and was relieved with rest, attributed to claudication, which was different from his current symptoms. He had had diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia for more than 10 years, as well as peripheral vascular disease, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, chronic constipation, urinary retention due to prostatic hypertrophy (for which transurethral prostatic resection had been performed 3 years earlier), and for 6 years, worsening chronic kidney disease (stage 3 of 5) (\nTable 1\n). He had had a benign colonic adenoma on routine colonoscopy 3 years earlier and a positive tuberculin skin test in the distant past, with negative chest radiographs. He had a history of noncompliance with medications but had recently become more adherent, owing to a visiting nurse and pharmacy-provided prepackaged medications. Daily medications on admission included lisinopril (20 mg), amlodipine (10 mg), metoprolol (200 mg), hydralazine (100 mg in divided doses), furosemide (40 mg), doxazosin (8 mg), simvastatin (40 mg daily for 9 months; previously 20 mg daily for 1.5 years), finasteride (5 mg), levothyroxine (88 \u03bcg), ferrous sulfate (325 mg), sodium polystyrene sulfonate (30 g), aspirin (81 mg), and insulin glargine (70 U); other medications were gemfibrozil (600 mg twice daily for 2.5 years), ergocalciferol (50,000 U twice monthly), lactulose (20 g as needed for constipation), and travoprost eyedrops. He had no known allergies. He was born in Mexico, had immigrated to the United States more than two decades earlier, and lived with his wife; he spoke primarily Spanish and was illiterate. He was retired from a service position, with possible exposure to cleaning solvents. He was a former smoker, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother and sister had had diabetes mellitus.\nOn examination, the patient was obese, in no physical distress, and anxious and tearful. The temperature was 37\u00b0C, the blood pressure 150/72 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The general physical examination was normal. On examination by a neurologist, the strength in both arms was 5 out of 5; strength in the quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and extensor hallucis longus muscles was 3 out of 5 on the left and 2 out of 5 on the right. Gait could not be evaluated because of weakness. Reflexes were diffusely decreased, and plantar reflexes were equivocal. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal.\nThe platelet count and tests of coagulation were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, calcium, ionized calcium, alkaline phosphatase, lactic acid, lipase, and N-terminal propeptide of B-type natriuretic peptide. Screening of the blood for troponin I and toxins was negative; other results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Urinalysis revealed brown, turbid urine with a pH of 6.0, specific gravity of 1.010, 2+ albumin, 3+ occult blood, 0 to 2 red and white cells per high-power field, 3 to 5 hyaline casts and 10 to 20 granular casts per low-power field, very few renal tubular cells, and amorphous crystals and mucin. An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph was clear. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed nonspecific periventricular hypoattenuation and partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells and middle-ear cavity, with an air\u2013liquid level within the left maxillary sinus. Lisinopril, simvastatin, and gemfibrozil were stopped; the patient's other medications were continued, and the administration of dextrose, bicarbonate, and intravenous crystalloid was begun. He was admitted to the medical service.\nDuring the next 3 days, heparin and epoetin alfa were added, and intravenous furosemide and fluids were administered to maintain urine output. Cultures of the blood and urine were sterile. Nerve-conduction studies were essentially normal; there was no evidence of axonal or demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Electromyography (EMG) showed brief myotonic discharges and short, polyphasic, early-recruited motor-unit potentials in the left deltoid and biceps. Echocardiography revealed trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and was otherwise normal. The level of methylmalonic acid was normal, and screening of the urine for toxins was negative.\nOn the third day, abdominal distention and pain developed. An abdominal radiograph showed numerous gas-filled loops of bowel, consistent with ileus. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, without the use of contrast material, revealed no evidence of bowel obstruction. Nasogastric and rectal tubes were placed, and the abdominal distention and pain improved. Blood levels of thyrotropin, ferritin, vitamin B\n12\n, and folate were normal. Testing for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a dilution of 1:160, in a speckled pattern, and testing for antibodies to Ro (SSA) was positive (115.24 optical-density units; reference range, 0 to 19.99); testing for other autoantibodies was negative. Other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nOn the fifth day, the blood level of \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase was normal and a random urine specimen revealed a creatinine level of 0.6 mg per milliliter (5746 \u03bcmol per liter) and a protein level of 1550 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 135). Results of serologic testing for hepatitis A virus were consistent with past exposure; testing for hepatitis B and C viruses was negative. Other test results are shown in\nTable 1\n. Muscle tenderness and weakness persisted; on the 7th day, strength was 1 to 2 out of 5 in the legs and 3 out of 5 in the arms.\nOn the eighth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",

Both kidneys were small, with mild perinephric fat stranding, features consistent with chronic renal parenchymal disease.*Dr. David:* This patient presented with generalized weakness, which can result from injury to the nervous system at any level, from the cerebral cortex to the muscle fiber. We must first define where the primary pathological process resides, since each level of the neuraxis suggests a specific differential diagnosis. Defining the anatomy is the key to identifying the cause.\n### Central or Peripheral Injury\n\nWhether the injury is central or peripheral in origin must be determined first. Central origins encompass the cerebral cortex, the brain stem, and the spinal cord. In this case, a cortical localization would be unlikely. Weakness involving both arms and both legs would imply injury to a large area of cortex in both hemispheres, which would almost certainly produce impairment of consciousness, which is not present in this patient. Brain-stem lesions often impair consciousness, produce deficits in cranial-nerve function, and result in disturbances of sensation or coordination; none of these features are reported in this patient. Finally, spinal cord lesions often produce sensory signs and symptoms and disruption of bowel and bladder function, which are not mentioned in this case. Thus, a central origin seems unlikely.\n### Peripheral Disorders\n\nIn considering peripheral disorders, it is helpful to start with a conceptual dissection of the motor unit. The peripheral motor unit consists of a cell body in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, its principal axon and terminal arborizations, the neuromuscular junctions at the nerve\u2013muscle interface, and the muscle fibers. Generalized weakness can result from disease processes involving any level of the peripheral motor unit, and each level suggests specific diagnostic possibilities. Clues are often provided by the physical examination.\n#### Physical Examination\n\nFirst, what is the pattern of weakness? Is it proximal or distal? Although important exceptions exist, weakness that is predominantly proximal is usually indicative of a myopathic disorder, and weakness that is predominantly distal indicates a neuropathic condition. Segmental weakness involving selected myotomes in a multifocal distribution may implicate a motor neuronopathy (disorder of the anterior horn cells). Task-specific fatigable weakness raises suspicion of a disorder of neuromuscular transmission. In the current case, the weakness was initially confined to the legs, both distally and proximally. The weakness was progressive and by day 7 involved the arms. Detailed information on the pattern of weakness is not presented, but it seems likely to be one of generalized weakness involving both proximal and distal muscles. In itself, this information does not assist our localization efforts.The sensory examination also provides important evidence. Results of sensory testing are commonly abnormal in patients with neuropathies and normal in patients with myopathic conditions, disorders of neuromuscular transmission, and diseases involving the anterior horn cells. The sensory examination does provide some insight in this case. Although paresthesias were reported 6 days before admission, there was no further mention of sensory symptoms during the ensuing 2 weeks and the two neurologic examinations did not document a disturbance of sensation. This would imply a predominantly motor syndrome, rendering a generalized neuropathic condition less likely.Finally, the reflex examination can provide discriminating information. Reflexes are usually diminished or absent in generalized neuropathies, sometimes out of proportion to the degree of weakness. Alternatively, reflexes are relatively preserved in myopathies, unless the condition is quite advanced. In disorders of neuromuscular transmission, reflexes are usually preserved in myasthenia gravis but reduced in the Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Reflexes may be accentuated or depressed in motor-neuron disorders, depending on the clinical context. Regarding this patient, there is a single reference to diffusely decreased reflexes at the time of admission. It is not clear whether the reflexes were diminished or absent, and we do not know how the reflexes evolved with time. A transition from normal reflexes or relative hyporeflexia to a state of areflexia over a period of 2 weeks would provide strong evidence for the relevance of the reflex examination. In addition, the reflex examination could have been confounded by the patient's long-standing diabetes and the possibility of a subclinical diabetic neuropathy. Given these factors, it is difficult to interpret the significance of the reflex examination as stated.Although the data are limited, the examination indicates a motor-predominant syndrome that is both generalized and progressive. The absence of sensory signs and symptoms lessens the likelihood of a neuropathy. Consequently, we can focus on disorders of muscle, the neuromuscular junction, and the anterior horn cells.\n#### Laboratory Data\n\nThe laboratory data provide additional clues. Without question, most remarkable is the creatine kinase level, measured at 37,479 U per liter on admission. This single observation argues strongly for a myopathic process. Disorders of neuromuscular transmission do not produce elevations in the creatine kinase level. Although motor neuronopathies may be associated with a mild increase in the creatine kinase level, they do not produce such striking elevations.At this point, review of electrodiagnostic testing would be useful.*Dr. David A. Chad:* A portable electrodiagnostic study was carried out at the bedside. The electrodiagnostic evaluation is an extension of the clinical examination and has two main portions. Nerve-conduction studies assess the function of sensory and motor nerves, and needle examination or EMG assesses muscle at rest and during mild contraction. EMG assesses the function and structure of the motor unit and helps to localize weakness to a particular level of the motor unit.Electrodiagnostic studies elicited normal sensory-nerve (sural and superficial radial) and motor-nerve (tibial, peroneal, and ulnar) responses, and the tibial F-wave latency (which indicates the function of the most proximal segment of the motor fiber) was also normal. These normal results all pointed away from a disorder of the peripheral nerves. We performed EMG on selected muscles (distal and proximal) of the arm and leg and found abnormalities in the biceps and deltoid. When these muscles were examined at rest, there was abnormal spontaneous activity in the form of mild fibrillation potentials and brief, waning myotonic discharges ([Figure 2A and 2B](#f02), and [Video 1](#v01) [available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org]), features suggestive of muscle-membrane irritability. During mild-to-moderate voluntary activity, motor-unit potentials showed early recruitment and short duration, low amplitude, and polyphasic form ([Videos 2 and 3](#v01)). In a pattern of early recruitment, many more motor units discharge than expected for the force of contraction, a phenomenon characteristically seen in muscle disorders involving a normal number of motor units but a reduced complement of intact muscle fibers for each unit. The EMG findings for this patient, therefore, were indicative of a myopathic process with membrane irritability.*Dr. David:* The results of EMG tests are helpful in two ways. First, they confirm our suspicion of a myopathy and make a generalized neuropathic or motor-neuron process unlikely. Equally important is the finding of abnormal spontaneous activity. Reduction in the amplitude and duration of motor-unit potentials is seen in most myopathies, but diffuse muscle-membrane irritability is characteristic of only a few \u2014 inflammatory myopathies, toxic or necrotic myopathies, dystrophic myopathies, and selected congenital and metabolic myopathies. In this patient, toxic and inflammatory processes are the leading contenders. Differentiating between these two categories has implications for treatment.\n### Toxic Myopathy\n\nOf the two types of myopathy under consideration, toxic injury would be the more likely, with particular attention focused on the role of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (i.e., statins). Myalgias are reported by 10 to 20% of patients who take statins, but the incidence of severe myotoxicity (a creatine kinase level exceeding 10 times the upper limit of the normal range, associated with muscle symptoms leading to hospitalization) is estimated at 0.1 to 1.0%,[1,2](#core-r001) or 0.4 to 1.1 per 10,000 patient-years. Risk factors for the development of a statin-associated myopathy include concurrent medications (e.g., fibrates and calcium-channel blockers), older age, hypothyroidism, hepatic dysfunction, and a high body-mass index,[3](#core-r003) four of which this patient had.The risk of a statin-induced myopathy is dose-dependent, and the risk among patients who receive high-dose therapy is higher by a factor of 10 than the risk among patients who receive more moderate doses; simvastatin may be particularly notorious in this regard.[4](#core-r004) Thus, any concurrent medication that can increase the plasma level of a statin by modifying its bioavailability can theoretically promote muscle injury. Drugs that compete with the cytochrome P-450 system could potentially augment statin myotoxicity. Simvastatin is metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. A case series reported an increased risk of myopathy with the combination of simvastatin and other CYP3A4 inhibitors.[5](#core-r005) At least three of this patient's medications (amlodipine, doxazosin, and finasteride) use this pathway. Thus, this patient's concomitant medications rendered him vulnerable to the myotoxic effects of simvastatin.Gemfibrozil poses an additional problem, since it may interfere with the hepatic uptake of simvastatin through inhibition of the organic anion\u2013transporting polypeptide system, and boost plasma levels of the statin. Gemfibrozil also inhibits CYP2C8, another isoenzyme involved in simvastatin metabolism. Concurrent therapy with statins and gemfibrozil has been associated with an increased risk of myopathy; in one study,[6](#core-r006) the average incidence of rhabdomyolysis per 10,000 patient-years increased from 0.49 to 18.73.\n### Inflammatory Myopathy\n\nInflammatory myopathies (dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion-body myositis) can also produce the electrophysiological pattern seen in this case. There is an association between inflammatory myopathies and rheumatologic disease, and this patient does have elevated levels of antinuclear antibody and anti-Ro antibody. However, this patient's clinical presentation does not suggest an inflammatory myopathy. These disorders typically evolve subacutely, or in the case of inclusion-body myositis, chronically. Reports exist of unsuspected, underlying neuromuscular disorders being unmasked by statins. This is a possibility that cannot be discounted.\n### Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy Due to Statins\n\nA final consideration is an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, in which elevated creatine kinase levels and proximal muscle weakness persist or progress, despite discontinuation of the statin.[7,8](#core-r007) Muscle-biopsy specimens from such patients show muscle necrosis but not inflammation, and the patients may respond to intensive immunosuppressive therapy, favoring an immune-mediated mechanism triggered by statins. Recently, autoantibodies against HMG-CoA reductase[7,9](#core-r007) have been described in such patients; these autoantibodies were not found in asymptomatic statin users or in patients with statin-associated myalgias. If subsequent studies show a favorable sensitivity and specificity, testing for these antibodies may ultimately differentiate between patients who will improve after discontinuation of the statin and those who will need immunomodulatory therapies. On the basis of the available data, it is not possible to differentiate between these two possibilities in this patient. However, the patient's weakness and elevated creatinine kinase levels developed in the context of active statin use, favoring direct myotoxicity.\n### Summary\n\nThe most reasonable next step in this case would be to obtain a muscle-biopsy specimen to distinguish between toxic and inflammatory processes. Inflammatory processes might be amenable to immunomodulatory intervention. On the basis of the available data, I would anticipate the presence of necrotic fibers and the absence of inflammatory changes in the muscle or vessels.*Dr. Nancy Lee Harris* (Pathology): Dr. Kuri, would you tell us what the clinical team was thinking at the time?*Dr. Kuri:* Our clinical diagnosis was statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. We requested a muscle biopsy.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\n*Dr. E. Tessa Hedley-Whyte:* The diagnostic procedure was a biopsy of the right quadriceps muscle. When a muscle biopsy is performed, the first question usually asked is whether the disease process is neuropathic or myopathic. In this case, since testing suggested a primary muscle disorder, the purpose was to differentiate among dystrophic, inflammatory, metabolic, toxic, and drug-induced processes. The pathologist divides the muscle-biopsy specimen into three parts \u2014 one is flash-frozen for histochemical and light-microscopical analysis, one is processed for electron microscopy, and one is frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for biochemical or other analyses.Frozen sections from this patient's specimen were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and revealed increased variation in fiber diameters but no inflammatory cells and many necrotic muscle fibers ([Figure 3A](#f03)). Trichrome staining showed no evidence of fibrosis, ruling out a dystrophic process. Immunostaining for CD68, a macrophage marker, confirmed the presence of myophagocytosis, with macrophages invading the necrotic fibers ([Figure 3B](#f03)). Staining for membrane-attack complex, which is associated with dermatomyositis, was limited to necrotic fibers ([Figure 3C](#f03)). Epon-embedded sections that were 1 \u03bcm thick revealed a loss of cross striations, confirming damage to myocytes ([Figure 3D](#f03)). Electron-microscopical examination revealed membranous debris under the sarcolemma and around the nucleus, as well as disintegrating z bands, indicating active cellular damage ([Figure 3E](#f03)).These findings establish the diagnosis of a necrotizing noninflammatory myopathy that is consistent with exposure to statins. Necrotizing myopathy after exposure to statins may be immune-mediated,[8,10,11](#core-r008) in association with a serum autoantibody.[7](#core-r007) Examination of muscle-biopsy specimens in such cases shows evidence of inflammation in only a minority of specimens, but there is reportedly up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens, detectable by immunohistochemical analysis; such staining was not done in this case.[12](#core-r012)It is somewhat surprising that there is so little obvious tissue response in this muscle, 14 days after the onset of weakness and 8 days after cessation of statins. I would have expected to see more evidence of regeneration and more macrophage infiltration at this stage.*Dr. Harris:* Dr. Kuri, would you tell us how the patient did?*Dr. Kuri:* The patient's bowel function recovered, and the nasogastric and rectal tubes were removed by hospital day 10. The creatine kinase levels gradually decreased and returned to normal by the time of discharge, on day 15. His muscle strength also improved slowly. A rheumatology consultant thought that his myopathy probably did not have a rheumatologic cause. Unfortunately, his renal function did not recover, and hemodialysis was begun on hospital day 11. The patient was discharged to rehabilitation and recovered full muscle strength, but he had progression to end-stage renal disease and remains on hemodialysis.*Dr. Harris:* Are there any questions?*A Physician:* Was the ileus due to the statin-related myopathy?*Dr. David:* No, although the exact cause is unclear. The patient may have had an autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes, but he was quite ill and there were multiple confounding factors.*A Physician:* When I discuss statin therapy with patients, I tell them that if they have muscle pain or weakness, we will test the creatine kinase level and stop the drug before serious complications occur. This patient's course was rapid, and the workup was efficient, so it doesn't seem as though either the patient or the doctors did anything wrong, and yet the patient ended up on dialysis. How should we counsel patients who need statins?*Dr. David:* Fortunately, severe statin-related myopathies are rare. In addition, this patient harbored several associated risk factors that rendered him vulnerable to the myotoxic effects of statins. For the majority of patients, statin medications can be taken safely, although it is advisable to remain alert to the risks posed by concomitant medications.*Dr. Kuri:* I first saw this patient in my clinic when I was a house officer; he had been on this combination of medications for years, and I think this fact was probably falsely reassuring. He was illiterate and spoke little English, and I realized as I got to know him that he was taking his medications inconsistently. Therefore, I ordered medications by mail in blister packs for him. In retrospect, it is possible that he had not been consistently taking a full combination of medications, and perhaps by ensuring that he did take all his medications, I inadvertently caused this side effect. In addition, despite previous counseling about the side effects of statins, he did not seek medical attention for 6 days after the onset of pain and weakness.\n",

      "question": "A 55-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of hemoptysis.\nHe was well until two years earlier, when hyper-tension was found, and hydrochlorothiazide was administered. Six months before entry a routine physical examination was negative; no murmur was heard. One month before admission another routine examination by a second physician revealed a Grade 3 systolic murmur. An electrocardiogram and an x-ray film of the chest were normal. Four days before entry the patient experienced an abrupt onset of substernal \"heaviness\" that radiated to the left shoulder and back, accompanied by persistent dyspnea. One day later a dry cough and malaise developed, and the temperature rose to 37.8\u00b0C. Two days before admission he began to cough up pink, frothy sputum, and the dyspnea increased in severity. He entered another hospital, where examination showed that the temperature was 40\u00b0C. A heart murmur was audible, and inspiratory rales were heard over both lungs. The white-cell count was 14,000. An x-ray film of the chest showed a diffuse infiltrate in the right lung. Micro-scopical examination of a Gram-stained specimen of sputum revealed a mixture of gram-positive cocci and rods. A diagnosis of pneumonia was made, and penicillin was begun. On the following day the patient coughed up large quantities of bloody sputum, and the respiratory rate rose to 40. The blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg. Another x-ray film of the chest disclosed an infiltrate in the left lung as well as the right lung. Cultures of the sputum were negative for pathogenic microorganisms. Penicillin was discontinued, and cephalexin and gentamicin were begun. On the day of admission another x-ray film of the chest showed pulmonary edema.\nThe patient smoked cigarettes. There was no history of chest pain, rheumatic fever, previous murmur, recent dental procedures, diabetes mellitus, gout, hypercholesterolemia, chest trauma, or familial cardiac disease. There was no known exposure to active pulmonary infection, varicella, or skin pustules, and the patient had not traveled recently.\nThe temperature was 39.4\u00b0C, the pulse 100, and the respirations 25. The blood pressure was 115/60 mm Hg.\nOn examination the patient was a sweaty, dyspneic man of normal habitus who appeared acutely ill. No petechiae or splinter hemorrhages were seen. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm at 30\u00b0 of elevation. The thorax was of normal configuration; rales were heard over the lower half of each lung field. The heart was not enlarged, and the rhythm was regular; a Grade 4 holosystolic murmur was heard at the cardiac apex and was transmitted to the left axilla; no diastolic murmur or click was noted. The peripheral pulses were normal. The abdomen was normal, and there was no peripheral edema, clubbing, or cyanosis.\nThe urine was normal except that the sediment contained a few white and red cells with 10 hyaline casts per high-power field. The hematocrit was 38.6 per cent; the white-cell count was 14,100, with 84 per cent neutrophils. The platelet count was 200,000, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 5 mm per hour. The prothrombin time was 10 seconds, with a control of 11.5 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 31.4 seconds. The urea nitrogen was 16 mg per 100 ml (5.7 mmol per liter), the creatinine 1 mg per 100 ml (88.4 \u03bcumol per liter), the glucose 111 mg per 100 ml (6.2 mmol per liter), the conjugated bilirubin 0.8 mg per 100 ml (13.7 \u03bctmol per liter), the total bilirubin 1.6 mg per 100 ml (27.4 \u03bcmol per liter), the cholesterol 169 mg per 100 ml (4.3 mmol per liter), the thyroxine 8.3 \u03bcg per 100 ml (106.8 nmol per liter), and the protein 6.7 g (the albumin 3.2 g, and the globulin 3.5 g) per 100 ml. The sodium was 136 mmol, the potassium 3.8 mmol, the chloride 94 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 27 mmol per liter. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) was 22 U per milliliter (0.2 \u03bcumol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 190 U per milliliter (3.2 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), and the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 42 mU per milliliter (0.7 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter). An electrocardiogram (\nFig. 1\n) demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110, with normal intervals and a mean QRS axis of +75\u00b0; changes of anteroapical and inferior subendocardial ischemia were shown. X-ray films of the chest (\nFig. 2\n) revealed bilateral confluent interstitial and alveolar densities consistent with pulmonary edema; the heart and mediastinum appeared normal. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing room air, disclosed that the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO\n2\n) was 36 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO\n2\n) 27 mm Hg, and the pH 7.54. An echocardiogram showed pansystolic prolapse of the mitral-valve leaflets, without definite demonstration of a flail leaflet; no vegetations were observed on the mitral or aortic valve; the left atrium was not enlarged; the dimensions of the right and left ventricles could not be assessed adequately; no pericardial effusion was seen. Microscopical examination of a Gram-stained specimen of sputum revealed blood, a few neutrophils, and a mixture of bacteria. Several blood cultures from the referring hospital continued to show no growth.\nSpecimens of sputum, urine, and blood were obtained for culture, and oxygen, digoxin, and furosemide were instituted. The patient soon passed 500 ml of urine, and the dyspnea improved. Cephalexin, gentamicin, and methylprednisolone sodium succinate were administered. A Swan\u2013Ganz catheter was inserted; the pulmonary-artery pressure was 25/11 mm Hg, with a mean pressure of 18 mm Hg; the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was 11 mm Hg, without V waves. The systemic arterial pressure was 95 mm Hg systolic, and the cardiac output 6 liters per minute. The oxygen saturation in specimens of blood drawn from the pulmonary artery and superior vena cava was 56 per cent. Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination showed small hemorrhagic tracheobronchial erosions; there was no evidence of bleeding from the alveoli. Microscopical examination of a biopsy specimen from a bronchus disclosed edema and mild chronic inflammation. Acute respiratory failure developed; an endotracheal tube was inserted, and ventilatory assistance was initiated. The patient was admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit. Infusions of dopamine and isoproterenol were begun. While the patient was breathing an 80 per cent oxygen mixture, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 mm Hg, a specimen of arterial blood revealed that the PaO\n2\nwas 110 mm Hg, the PaCO\n2\n43 mm Hg, and the pH 7.47; the peripheral arterial pressure was 80/50 mm Hg. The temperature rose daily to the range of 37.2 to 37.8\u00b0C.\nOn the second hospital day the sputum decreased in volume but remained bloody. An L.E.-cell test was negative. An x-ray film of the chest showed that a pulmonary-artery line, a central-venous-pressure catheter, and an endotracheal tube terminated in appropriate positions; the diffuse pulmonary air-space opacities were unchanged. All cultures remained negative, as did examination of fungal wet mounts and microscopical examination of a stained smear for acid-fast bacilli. The patient was weaned from isoproterenol.\nOn the following day bloody material was aspirated from the nasogastric tube. The urine gave a + test for protein; the sediment contained 5 white cells and 5 red cells per high-power field. The hematocrit fell to 29 per cent. The urea nitrogen was 51 mg per 100 ml (18.2 mmol per liter), and the creatinine 1.4 mg per 100 ml (123.8 \u03bcumol per liter). An x-ray film of the chest disclosed slight improvement. Cimetidine was begun, and 1 unit of packed red cells was transfused. On the fourth hospital day the patient continued to cough up bloody sputum. Examination revealed no cutaneous lesions; the lungs were clear. The pulmonary-artery pressure was 62/17 mm Hg, with a mean pressure of 36 mm Hg. The Swan\u2013Ganz catheter was removed. The hematocrit fell from 35 to 29 per cent, and another unit of packed red cells was transfused.\nOn the fifth hospital day the blood pressure ranged from 90 to 110 mm Hg, systolic, while the patient was receiving an infusion of dopamine. The volume of grossly bloody sputum increased. All cultures remained negative. The urea nitrogen was 61 mg per 100 ml (21.8 mmol per liter), the creatinine 1.3 mg per 100 ml (114.9 \u03bcmol per liter), the conjugated bilirubin 0.6 mg per 100 ml (10.3 \u03bcmol per liter), and the total bilirubin 1 mg per 100 ml (17.1 \u03bcmol per liter). The SGOT was 20 U per milliliter (0.2 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter), and the LDH 300 U per milliliter (5.0 \u03bcmol \u00b7 sec\n-1\nper liter). The PaO\n2\ndeclined from 90 to 60 mm Hg while the patient was breathing a 35 per cent oxygen mix. An x-ray film of the chest demonstrated progression of the bilateral interstitial and parenchymal densities, particularly in the right lung; the heart appeared enlarged. Two additional units of packed red cells were transfused, and the Swan\u2013Ganz catheter was reinserted. An open-lung biopsy disclosed that the lungs were pink and appeared normal. Rigid bronchoscopic examination showed that the entire tracheobronchial tree was covered with blood; no individual site of bleeding was identified. Specimens were sent for routine viral and fungal cultures. On the following day scanty amounts of grossly bloody sputum were coughed up; microscopical examination revealed no neutrophils or microorganisms. The pulmonary-artery pressure was 50/30 mm Hg, with a mean pressure of 40 mm Hg; the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was 30 mm Hg, and the central venous pressure 12 mm of water; the cardiac output was 8 liters per minute; intermittent V waves were observed. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 105; the T waves were lower in Leads 1 and aVL in comparison to the earlier tracing but were less inverted in Leads 3 and aVF; the precordial leads were incomplete. An x-ray film of the chest was unchanged. Another echocardiogram showed that the motion of the mitral valve was highly suggestive of a flail leaflet; the left atrial size was at the upper limit of normal, and the aortic valve appeared normal; the volume of the left ventricle and the thickness of the interventricular septum and the posterior wall of the left ventricle could not be determined. The urea nitrogen was 47 mg per 100 ml (16.8 mmol per liter), and the creatinine 1.2 mg per 100 ml (106.1 \u03bcmol per liter). A Raji-cell assay was negative. Microscopical examination of the biopsy specimen of the lung (\nFig. 3\n) disclosed an unorganized thrombus, 2 mm in diameter, slight interstitial fibrosis, and intraalveolar hemorrhage; no evidence of vasculitis was seen. Three additional units of packed red cells were transfused. On the seventh hospital day the patient again coughed up large quantities of grossly bloody sputum; the volume of the hemoptysis decreased when the end-expiratory pressure was increased and became torrential without positive end-expiratory pressure. Large V waves were observed on the pulmonary-capillary wedge tracing. The heart rate rose to 150 per minute. An electrocardiogram showed no change. The hematocrit determined on the tracheal aspirate was 29 per cent.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Charles A. Boucher\\*: Dr. Miller, may we review the x-ray films of the chest?Dr. Stephen W. Miller: A film of the chest taken on admission ([Fig. 2](#f002)) shows a cardiac silhouette of normal size and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with air bronchograms, particularly at the base of the right lung. A film obtained five days later reveals slight enlargement of the heart. I cannot identify specific cardiac chambers. No masses or areas of consolidation are visible in the lungs, and there is no evidence of atelectasis to indicate pulmonary infarction. However, the persistent infiltrate could hide a mass. The infiltrate may have been the result of pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, or an exudate.Dr. Boucher: Dr. Fallon, will you review the findings in the biopsy specimens?Dr. John T. Fallon: The sections of the bronchial-biopsy specimen showed chronic inflammation. Examination of the lung-biopsy specimen revealed intraalveolar hemorrhage ([Fig. 3](#f003)). There was no reaction of the alveolar epithelium to suggest an active inflammatory process, such as influenza or an acute respiratory-tract infection. Very little congestion was present in the alveolar septa, although they appeared thickened and fibrotic, perhaps as a result of emphysema. The pulmonary veins in the septa were not dilated. A small pulmonary artery contained a fresh thrombus consisting of red cells, fibrin, and numerous polymorphonuclear cells. It could have originated from a clot surrounding the Swan\u2013Ganz catheter, which had been in place before the biopsy. The thrombus did not have the appearance of one that formed in a leg vein. There was no evidence of infarction.Dr. Boucher: Respiratory failure developed in this 55-year-old man in association with both mitral regurgitation and severe hemoptysis. Because mitral regurgitation is not generally considered a cause of severe hemoptysis one problem is to decide whether it was in this case or whether another more common but clinically less apparent cause was present. Before ascribing the hemoptysis to mitral regurgitation the clinicians who cared for this patient had to exclude other causes by performing the thorough workup that is described in the case record. The differential diagnosis is complicated by the fact that severe intraalveolar hemorrhage from whatever source, even a localized one, can produce findings similar to those of congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema, including dyspnea, rales, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, respiratory failure, hypotension, fever, and leukocytosis. I shall first discuss the possible causes of the severe hemoptysis in this case and then review certaindiagnostic features of mitral regurgitation, with particular emphasis on the assessment of its severity and hemodynamic importance.The patient was admitted because of hemoptysis, which usually reflects serious pulmonary disease if bleeding from the nasopharynx or upper gastrointestinal tract has been excluded. Whether the hemoptysis is scanty or massive is probably of little diagnostic value. As in any case of unexplained bleeding, a clotting disorder must be considered but was not evident in this patient. Trauma or a foreign body can result in hemoptysis, but we have no history to support either of them as a cause. Even after a thorough evaluation the cause of hemoptysis remains unknown in 5 to 10 per cent of the cases.[1\u20134](#core-r001)The four major categories of disease that can produce hemoptysis are infection, neoplasia, autoimmune disorders, and vascular abnormalities.Infections, including bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, lung abscess, pulmonary mycosis, and tuberculosis, are probably the most common causes of hemoptysis. Although this patient was a cigarette smoker, he had no history of a chronic cough with sputum production, an x-ray film of the chest one month before admission was normal, the bronchial biopsy showed no evidence of chronic bronchitis, and the sputum was not purulent. Hemoptysis is generally a late manifestation of infection, and the patient was not chronically ill and had no radiologic evidence of chronic pulmonary infection or an abscess cavity. He was febrile, had an elevated white-cell count, and was appropriately treated for acute pneumonia, but it seldom causes massive hemoptysis. Aspiration pneumonia is a consideration as the cause of the hemoptysis, but there was no history of alcoholism, heavy sedation, vomiting, or seizure disorder to predispose to aspiration. He had not received chronic antibiotic or immunosuppressive therapy, which favor the development of infection. He had no history of traveling in the tropics or exposure to the Oriental lung fluke, *Paragonimus westermani*, which can cause hemoptysis.If a neoplasm was the source of the hemoptysis it should have been detected on the x-ray films of the chest, bronchoscopic examination, or biopsy.Of various immunologic disorders associated with hemoptysis, Goodpasture's syndrome should be considered. It may present without evidence of azotemia, but the patients almost invariably have anemia, he-maturia, and proteinuria, none of which were found in this case. Wegener's granulomatosis is usually characterized by the presence of an upper-respiratory-tract lesion, abnormalities on x-ray films of the chest, and granulomas in biopsy specimens of the lung. Other disorders, including pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia, pulmonary hemosiderosis, amyloidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, may cause interstitial pulmonary disease and hemoptysis, but none of these diagnoses are supported by laboratory data or extra-pulmonary manifestations in this case.The vascular disorders that can cause hemoptysis include primary pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger's abnormal physiologic state, erosion of an aortic aneurysm into the lung, a pulmonary arteriovenous fistula, pulmonary infarction, and mitral stenosis. The first two considerations are excluded by the brief clinical course, the catheterization data, and the biopsies. An eroding aortic aneurysm is also improbable because an enlarged aortic shadow is not evident on the x-ray films of the chest. A pulmonary arteriovenous fistula would have been detected on careful review of the films of the chest, and there were no other findings, such as telangiectasia, cyanosis, or polycythemia, to suggest it. The one diagnosis that is difficult to eliminate is pulmonary infarction, although there was no radiologic evidence of it. A pulmonary angiographic study would be required to exclude it with certainty. The lung biopsy did show a small thromboembolus, but it may have been related to the Swan\u2013Ganz catheter and probably did not originate in a leg vein. The presence of pulmonary infarction, of course, does have a major therapeutic implication because it would require anticoagulation, which would be contraindicated if the hemoptysis was caused by any of the other disorders that I have mentioned.Hemoptysis is a well-known complication of mitral stenosis, [5\u20137](#core-r005) which is not a consideration in this case because of the findings on the echocardiogram. The hemoptysis may vary from blood-streaking of the sputum to hemorrhage massive enough to require emergency valve surgery. In 1954 Wood[5](#core-r005) reported that 18 per cent of a series of patients with mitral stenosis had profuse, sudden, unexpected hemorrhage from the lungs, which he termed \"pulmonary apoplexy.\" He noted that it occurred most frequently in patients with mixed mitral stenosis and regurgitation. The hemoptysis in association with mitral stenosis is thought to be due to rupture of submucosal bronchial varices. The chronically elevated pressure in the left atrium distends bronchial collateral veins that join the high-pressure pulmonary veins and the low-pressure azygos vein and right atrium. The veins in the lungs are the major capacitance vessels, and in the presence of severe mitral stenosis they may become distended sufficiently to double the total pulmonary blood volume.[8](#core-r008) Rupture of the distended vessels under high pressure may be precipitated by exertion or by pregnancy.[5](#core-r005) Wood also found that 75 per cent of the patients with hemoptysis and mitral stenosis had a normal cardiac output and normal or nearly normal pulmonary arteriolar resistance, and that when pulmonary arteriolar hypertension with decreased pulmonary blood flow developed the hemoptysis diminished. Therefore, the hemoptysis in a patient with mitral stenosis is usually a direct hemodynamic consequence of the disease \u2014that is, elevated pulmonary venous pressure. A less common cause of hemoptysis in cases of severe mitral stenosis is pulmonary infarction. However, the patient with mitral stenosis who has pulmonary embolism with infarction tends to have a reduced cardiac output, increased pulmonary arteriolar resistance, and right ventricular failure.Although the left atrial pressure may be elevated markedly by mitral regurgitation as well as by mitral stenosis, the former is seldom mentioned as a cause of hemoptysis. In two series with a total of 149 patients with rheumatic mitral regurgitation 8 per cent had hemoptysis, but none had it to a severe degree.[9,10](#core-r009) Hemoptysis may be less frequent in cases of severe isolated mitral regurgitation because it is less common and its clinical course is often shorter than that of mitral stenosis. However, one case of massive hemoptysis due to ruptured chordae tendineae was reported in the French literature[11](#core-r011) in 1965, and two similar cases were discussed at these exercises in 1966[12](#core-r012) and in 1967.[13](#core-r013)Besides exemplifying the difficulties in evaluating and managing the patient with hemoptysis, the case under discussion illustrates two problems related to mitral regurgitation. The first is recognizing whether it is present, and the second is determining whether it is severe enough to cause pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. I shall concentrate on three aspects of the evaluation \u2014 the physical examination, the echocardiogram, and the right-sided cardiac catheterization.The patient presented with a loud apical holosystolic murmur that radiated to the axilla, a typical murmur of mitral regurgitation. However, an apical systolic murmur is a common finding and only occasionally reflects severe valvular incompetence. On the other hand, the murmur in patients with severe mitral regurgitation may be unimpressive when the cardiac output is reduced. Therefore, the murmur itself is not a reliable criterion of mitral regurgitation. Other physical findings that can indicate a severe degree of mitral regurgitation are a diffuse hyperdynamic left ventricular impulse, a widely split second heart sound, and a small but sharp carotid upstroke, all of which reflect the rapid ejection of a large volume of blood from the ventricle into an atrium with a relatively low pressure. In addition, expansion of the left atrium with each systole may produce a parasternal lift. In the presence of pulmonary congestion and pulmonary hypertension the pulmonic component of the second heart sound may be accentuated secondary to the mitral regurgitation. Did the physicians taking care of this patient find evidence of hemodynamic overload?Dr. Richard Liberthson: Those findings were present on admission but became more marked during the course in the hospital. The left ventricular impulse was hyperdynamic, the second sound was prominently split, a parasternal life developed, and the carotid upstrokes were brisk and diminished in volume.Dr. Boucher: That information suggests that the patient did have severe mitral regurgitation throughout the hospital course.The loud apical murmur, which was apparently new, was associated with severe dyspnea, a normal sinus rhythm, a normal cardiac size on x-ray films of the chest, a normal left atrium as demonstrated by the echocardiogram, and no electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. The combination of the new murmur and the pulmonary edema out of proportion to the cardiac size strongly suggests mitral regurgitation of recent onset. In contrast, when mitral regurgitation is of long standing, left atrial and left ventricular enlargement and atrial fibrillation are usually present.Acute severe mitral regurgitation is a widely recognized entity.[14,15](#core-r014) It may occur as a result of sudden damage to any part of the mitral-valve apparatus, including the papillary muscles, and is usually due to myocardial infarction, rupture of chordae tendineae, billowing of the mitral leaflet, or a left atrial myxoma. The patient did have substernal pain, but there were no diagnostic electrocardiographic or enzymatic changes to suggest myocardial infarction. The ST-segment depression demonstrated on an electrocardiogram ([Fig. 1](#f001)) may have been due to subendocardial infarction, but this finding is nonspecific and may be seen with almost any type of heart disease or digitalis therapy. The echocardiogram suggested a flail leaflet and excluded a left atrial myxoma. Therefore, the most likely cause is rupture of chordae tendineae. In 30 to 40 per cent of the cases the cause of the rupture is bacterial endocarditis, which must be suspected in any patient with acute valvular insufficiency. This patient was febrile but had been entirely well until four days before admission. Furthermore, the blood cultures were negative, the sedimentation rate was low, and the Raji-cell assay was negative. No vegetation was indicated on the echocardiogram, although a vegetation may be missed with that procedure, especially early in the clinical course before healing and calcification have occurred.[16](#core-r016) Thus, there was no definite evidence of bacterial endocarditis.This patient had hypertension, which has also been associated with ruptured chordae tendineae, and he was a 55-year-old man. It is noteworthy that most patients with ruptured chordae are males, 45 to 60 years of age. The murmur in this disorder is prominent and usually radiates to the axilla and lower left sternal border, as in this case. However, it may radiate more widely, depending on the direction of the regurgitant jet, and it may mimic aortic stenosis if the jet is directed superiorly and medially. The second heart sound can be useful in distinguishing the murmur of aortic stenosis from the murmur of mitral regurgitation transmitted to the base of the heart. In the presence of aortic stenosis left ventricular ejection is prolonged, and the aortic-valve closure is delayed or absent, resulting in a narrowly split single heart sound or a paradoxically split second heart sound. In the presence of mitral regurgitation, in contrast, left ventricular ejection is rapid, and the aortic-valve closure is early, producing a widely split second heart sound.Although I have assumed that the murmur in this case was due to mitral regurgitation, it must be remembered that a new loud systolic murmur can also result from a ventricular septal defect or tricuspid incompetence. A ventricular septal defect was excluded by the lack of an oxygen step-up at the right-sided cardiac catheterization. Tricuspid regurgitation would have been manifested by more severe right-sided heart failure and pulsatile neck veins and would not explain the elevated pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure.The murmur was suspicious enough to prompt an echocardiographic study, which has both value and limitations in the assessment of mitral regurgitation. It may suggest an anatomical abnormality, such as a vegetation, a flail leaflet, or mitral-valve prolapse, thickening, or calcification. In this case the echocardiogram showed holosystolic sagging of the posterior leaflet consistent with mitral-valve prolapse, and there were abnormal diastolic echoes suggestive of a flail mitral leaflet. However, the M-mode echocardiogram is not always abnormal in patients with a flail leaflet, and, conversely, there can be an abnormal echo pattern suggestive of a flail leaflet in a patient with mitral regurgitation of other cause.[17](#core-r017) The two-dimensional echocardiographic study appears to be superior in determining the presence of a flail mitral-valve leaflet, but that was not performed in this patient. Because the ultrasound approach assesses only the valve structure and does not evaluate the regurgitation directly, definitive conclusions about the severity of the regurgitation, even with a technically adequate study, must be made with caution.Cardiac failure in the setting of valvular heart disease has two components \u2014 one due to the mechanical burden and the other due to underlying myocardial dysfunction. The extent to which each component contributes to the failure varies and has important prognostic implications. In cases of isolated rupture of a papillary muscle or chordae tendineae the main problem is mechanical. In contrast, severe congestive cardiomyopathy, either idiopathic or due to coronary-artery disease, may result in mitral regurgitation, and in such cases there is also myocardial dysfunction. One of the best means of determining the contribution of these two factors is measurement of the ejection fraction, which is the ratio of stroke volume to end-diastolic volume. A normal ejection fraction in a patient with mitral regurgitation suggests a mechanical cause of the heart failure. The lower the ejection fraction the more myocardial dysfunction is likely to be present. The ejection fraction may be approximated by echocardiographic study, but unfortunately in this patient the left ventricle could not be evaluated for technical reasons. The ejection fraction can also be determined noninvasively by radionuclide ventriculographic examination, which was not performed in this case. An evaluation of left ventricular systolic function may also confirm the presence of severe mitral regurgitation. The finding of a dilated left ventricle with an increased stroke volume suggests left ventricular volume overload, but that still does not measure the regurgitation directly. At present the only method of confirming the diagnosis of severe mitral regurgitation is a left ventriculographic study with contrast material at cardiac catheterization. In the future we may also be able to quantitate mitral regurgitation using the Doppler technique, but that method is not currently available.With the clinical and echocardiographic findings suggesting acute mitral regurgitation, the physicians caring for this patient proceeded with right-sided cardiac catheterization to confirm that the regurgitation was severe enough to cause heart failure. Patients with acute mitral regurgitation usually have a marked elevation of the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressures with prominent V waves because of the regurgitation of blood at high ventricular pressures into a noncompliant left atrium of normal size. Therefore, the finding of a normal wedge pressure initially with the insertion of the pulmonary-artery catheter was puzzling and inconsistent with the clinical impression. Furthermore, it might have led to the assumption that the mitral regurgitation was not severe enough to cause heart failure, pulmonary edema, or hemoptysis. Against the assumption that there was no congestive heart failure was the fact that the jugular venous pressure had been elevated on admission. Right-sided heart failure may result from a sudden pressure overload in the right ventricle produced by acute mitral regurgitation. There was clinical evidence of improvement with digitalis and diuretics, consistent with heart failure. In addition, there was no obvious predisposing cause for noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, such as trauma, burn, uremia, hemorrhagic shock, pancreatitis, or sepsis. Blood in the lung can be responsible for pulmonary edema, but the pulmonary edema preceded the hemoptysis in this case.It is well known that the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure may be normal in patients with severe mitral regurgitation. A normal pressure can occur when the left atrium is markedly enlarged, which was not the situation in this patient. In addition, the wedge pressure can be strikingly altered by changes in the blood volume or in the systemic vascular resistance. In eight patients with severe mitral regurgitation studied by Chatterjee et al.[18](#core-r018) an intravenous infusion of nitroprusside lowered the mean arterial pressure from 83 to 70 mm Hg and the mean wedge pressure from 33 to 16 mm Hg (P<0.001). In seven similar patients studied by Harshaw et al.[19](#core-r019) nitroprusside lowered the mean arterial pressure from 87 to 65 mm Hg and the mean wedge pressure from 29 to 13 mm Hg (P<0.001). Therefore, a single normal wedge-pressure recording does not exclude severe mitral regurgitation. In this patient, however, fever, diuresis, and hemorrhage caused volume depletion and decreased systemic vascular resistance. At the time of the initial catheterization the blood pressure was 95 mm Hg systolic, which may have been partly responsible for the normal filling pressures despite the presence of severe mitral regurgitation. If the diagnosis of severe mitral regurgitation is strongly suspected and the wedge pressure is normal, one may proceed either with left ventriculographic examination or with stressing the patient with exercise, volume overload, or a pharmacologic increase in the blood pressure. A left ventriculographic study can establish the diagnosis, and stress may unmask hemodynamic abnormalities such as those that subsequently became evident in this patient. Another possible explanation for the change from a normal wedge pressure initially to an elevated one subsequently is an increase in the degree of regurgitation from moderate to severe.I conclude that this patient had acute mitral regurgitation, probably as a result of spontaneous rupture of chordae tendineae. Pulmonary edema and then hemoptysis ensued. These two findings were temporally associated and presumably occurred on a physiologic basis similar to that present in cases of mitral stenosis \u2014 that is, elevated pulmonary venous pressure resulting in rupture of submucosal bronchial veins. The hemoptysis appeared to vary inversely with the positive end-expiratory pressure, consistent with a source of bleeding that was high-pressure venous and not arterial in nature, similar to esophageal varices, since the bleeding virtually ceased with 10 to 15 mm Hg of pressure. Positive end-expiratory pressure is known to produce a dramatic fall in pulmonary blood flow, accounting for the decrease in the rate of hemoptysis. Pulmonary embolism is a possibility in this patient, although there was no evidence to suggest it, and therefore a pulmonary angiographic examination was indicated. My assumption that the hemoptysis was due to mitral regurgitation can best be confirmed by the subsequent clinical course. In other words, with a sustained reduction in the left atrial pressure after valve replacement, which I assume was performed, there should no longer have been hemoptysis.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Liberthson, will you tell us your impressions in following this patient?Dr. Liberthson: Dr. Frederick H. Levine, Dr. Barry W. Levine, and I shared in this patient's care. We were perplexed by the findings on the initial rightsided cardiac catheterization, but on clinical grounds there was little doubt that he had severe mitral incompetence. The early management was complicated by fever, which raised the question of endocarditis. We were reluctant, therefore, to catheterize the left ventricle until we had excluded this possibility. It would have been helpful, as Dr. Boucher mentioned, to stress this patient to assess the severity of the mitral incompetence more accurately, but the severe respiratory failure made that procedure impossible. After the initial right-sided cardiac catheterization we left the pulmonary catheter in place, and each day the pulmonary-artery mean and systolic pressures and wedge pressures and V waves increased in amplitude. We repeated cardiac catheterization on the sixth hospital day. There was marked elevation of the rightsided cardiac pressures, with a mean wedge pressure of 28 mm Hg and a V wave of 75 mm Hg. No oxygen step-up occurred on catheterization of the right side of the heart. There was slight systemic arterial desaturation. Selective left ventriculograms demonstrated excellent left ventricular contraction and a vigorous, rather small left ventricle, a somewhat small left atrium, and severe mitral incompetence. Pulmonary angiographic examination did not show segmental obstruction or a bleeding site.Dr. Allan L. Friedlich: Do you think that there was enough blood in the alveoli to cause volume depletion and to account for the fever?Dr. Liberthson: The hemoptysis was severe, with daily volumes of 300 to 400 ml. The hematocrit of the expectorated blood was 29 per cent. Alveolar hemorrhage may well have been the cause of the fever.Dr. Miller: The pulmonary angiograms, as Dr. Liberthson pointed out, showed no evidence of emboli or arteriovenous or other vascular malformations. The left ventriculograms demonstrated a prolapsing mitral-valve leaflet.Dr. Scully: Dr. Levine, will you tell us about the operation?Dr. Frederick H. Levine: By the time that the patient was taken to the operating room the hemoptysis was massive. We were concerned that it would be a difficult problem because the blood gases had been compromised, and the bleeding might become more severe after heparinization. The patient was cannulated and placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. As soon as the left side was decompressed the hemoptysis stopped abruptly. When the left atrium was opened it was apparent that the posterior leaflet was large and flail, and that all the chordae attachments to the posterior leaflet had ruptured. The valve was easily excised, and a prosthetic valve was put in place. The subsequent course was uneventful, with hemoptysis no longer a problem.Dr. Fallon: Examination of the excised valve showed rupture of several primary chordae tendineae of the posterior leaflet. Both leaflets were thickened and boggy, and the posterior leaflet was markedly redundant, with prominent interchordal hooding. Microscopical sections of the posterior leaflet revealed severe myxomatous degeneration of the fibrosa ([Fig. 4](#f004)), with accumulation of metachromatic ground substance. Similar changes were present focally in the chordae tendineae.The pathogenesis of myxomatous degeneration of cardiac valves is poorly understood. This finding is not specific but is common to a variety of isolated cardiac as well as systemic diseases. However, spontaneous chordal rupture due to myxomatous degeneration is an unusual complication. Ultrastructural studies by Caulfield and his co-workers[20](#core-r020) demonstrated dissolution of both collagen fibers and elastic tissue in chordae from cases of spontaneous rupture. Recently, Hammer and his associates[21](#core-r021) performed collagen analysis of a prolapsed mitral valve associated with ruptured chordae, using gel electrophoresis, and compared the results with those from normal mitral valves. They found that normal valves have three types of collagen \u2014 Type I, Type III, and Type AB. The abnormal valve, however, had no Type III or AB collagen. Bonella et al.[22](#core-r022) examined the procollagen contents of normal and myxomatous mitral valves and found a marked increase in both cross-linked procollagen and single-chain procollagen in the latter. These studies suggest that patients with prolapsed mitral valves and chordal rupture have a defect of collagen biosynthesis.Dr. Scully: Did these patients have collagen deficiencies in any other tissues?Dr. Fallon: That aspect was not investigated in these studies. Of course, there are several genetic diseases, such as Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome Type IV and Marfan's syndrome, in which connective-tissue deficiencies or abnormalities are known to exist and in which mitral-valve prolapse and even ruptured chordae may occur. However, in these diseases clinical evidence of a systemic connective-tissue disorder is usually present. Such evidence does not exist in most patients with a prolapsed mitral valve.Dr. Liberthson: Is it usual that the other valves are abnormal in patients with myxomatous change in the mitral valve?Dr. Fallon: According to my experience, there is a relatively high frequency of myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve at autopsy without similar changes in the other three cardiac valves. In the few cases of spontaneous rupture of the mitral-valve chordae that I have seen no changes were apparent within the other valves. Of course, in patients with Marfan's syndrome it is common to see myxomatous degeneration of both the aortic valve and the mitral valve. This combination of involvement is also present in some types of the Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome.Dr. Boucher: The two most common causes of isolated mitral regurgitation are a billowing, redundant leaflet and ruptured chordae tendineae. Are these two disorders variations of the same disease?Dr. Fallon: I don't know the answer, but I can speculate on the basis of the data from Hammer et al., [21](#core-r021) who found that the billowing or floppy valves that had not ruptured had the normal collagen types. This finding suggests that the two entities that you mentioned may differ, at least biochemically.Dr. Boucher: They also appear to differ clinically. Mitral-valve prolapse appears to be fairly common and predominantly a female disorder, whereas rupture of chordae occurs most often in males.Dr. Fallon: The problem for the morphologist is the nonspecificity of valvular myxomatous degeneration. For example, it occurs in the mitral valve in cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and congestive cardiomyopathy and in the aortic valve in cases of insufficiency due to aortic ectasia. It seems that the patients with spontaneous rupture of the mitral chordae have a different disease, even though the valves are morphologically similar.Dr. Friedlich: I have heard surgeons say that the myocardium appeared soft and the mitral annulus friable in patients with this disease, and that the frequency of paravalvular leak was greater than it is in patients with other valvular disorders. Are extra sutures and different surgical techniques still used in treating patients with this disease?Dr. Levine: I have not encountered any concern about the myocardium, but certainly the annulus in these patients differs from that in patients with rheumatic mitral-valve disease. This abnormality has led many surgeons to use reinforced sutures for replacing the valves in these patients. We usually do not reinforce our sutures, and the frequency of paravalvular leak for any of our valve procedures over the last several years has been far less than it was previously as techniques have improved.Dr. Friedlich: Isolated rupture of the posterior leaflet usually causes a murmur that radiates more to the left sternal border than to the back. Was there any clue that such a pattern of radiation was present in the patient under discussion?Dr. Liberthson: Yes. The murmur was heard best at the left sternal border.\n",

      "question": "A 33-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of painful legs.\nThe patient was known to have the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. At the age of 14 years a left retinal hemangioma was found. Seven years later a left cerebellar hemangioblastoma was removed at another hospital, and radiation treatment was administered. At the age of 24 years the left eye was enucleated; multiple hemangiomas were observed in the right eye. Repeated photocoagulation procedures were performed, but an irreparable retinal detachment eventually developed. At the age of 27 years a cataract was found, and one year later the patient was completely blind.\nAt 29 years of age he was first seen at this hospital, where an angiographic study disclosed multiple vascular tumors in the cerebellum and in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal canal. Radiation treatment was delivered to the spinal cord from the level of the first cervical to the second lumbar segments. An intravenous pyelographic examination revealed a cluster of small calcifications in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, believed to lie within the pancreas; the kidneys and their excretory passages appeared normal; the bladder was poorly seen because of a large volume of residual urine; the patient was unable to void. At the age of 30 years he returned to the hospital. A left cerebellar hemangioblastoma and five similar tumors in the right cerebellar vermis were excised. Four months later he returned to the hospital, and a cervical laminectomy was performed, with removal of an arteriovenous malformation.\nAt 32 years of age the patient underwent excision of a lumbar arachnoid cyst, with drainage of a cyst within the spinal cord. He was incontinent of urine and feces. Repeated catheterization of the bladder was necessary; a urinary-tract infection developed and was treated, and he was discharged on bethanechol chloride. Several months before entry he began to experience an increase in long standing burning pain in both lower extremities, and a disturbance of his gait became more severe. He returned to the hospital.\nThere was a history of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome in the patient's father, who had died at the age of 35 years.\nThe temperature was 37\u00b0C, the pulse 80, and the respirations 16. The blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg.\nExamination revealed an ataxic man with scanning speech. The general physical examination was negative. Neurologic examination disclosed that the arms were strong, although there was moderate weakness in both lower extremities. Hypalgesia was noted below the 12th thoracic segment on the right side, with absent vibratory sensation and poor position and touch sensation in the same area. The ankle jerks were diminished, and the plantar responses neutral.\nThe urine gave a + test for protein; the sediment contained innumerable white cells per high-power field. The hematocrit was 45.1 per cent; the white-cell count was 4800, with a normal differential count. X-ray films of the chest were normal. A thoracolumbar myelographic examination (\nFig. 1\n) showed an incomplete block due to an intramedullary cystic lesion between the 12th thoracic and second lumbar segments. A selective transfemoral anterior spinal angiographic examination (\nFig. 2\n) revealed a vascular tumor in the conus medullaris. An intravenous pyelographic examination with nephrotomograms showed a partially calcified mass, 2 cm in diameter, that arose from the inferior hilar lip of the right kidney; flecks of calcification were also observed over the upper outer portion of the right kidney, and the renal cortex was ill defined on several views; the intrarenal collecting system and renal pelvis appeared otherwise normal; the left kidney and both ureters were normal; the urinary bladder was markedly trabeculated. A percutaneous bilateral selective renal angiographic examination (\nFig. 3\n) disclosed multiple hypervascular lesions in the right kidney, none of which exceeded 1 cm in diameter; one was located in the midsuperior portion, two smaller lesions were adjacent to one another in the inferior pole, and a fourth was observed on the inferior lip of the renal cortex; an apparent cyst was seen adjacent to the medial inferior renal pole, and at least two additional cysts were observed in the inferolateral portion of the cortex. A hypervascular lesion was observed in the midlateral cortex of the left kidney, and a smaller, less definite lesion was seen in the upper pole; a left peripelvic cyst was also noted. A pulmonary tomographic study demonstrated that the tracheobronchial tree was normal, without lymphadenopathy; both lungs were clear except for a solitary noncalcified nodule, 1 cm in diameter, in the base of the right lung. A\n99m\nTc methylene diphosphonate bone scan disclosed a laminectomy defect from the 10th thoracic through the first lumbar segments; no other bony lesion was seen. A\n99m\nTc diethylene triamine pentacetic acid brain scan revealed a focal increase in activity in the left posterior parietal region, believed consistent with a craniotomy burr hole.\nOn the 13th hospital day a hemangioblastoma was excised from the lumbosacral region of the spinal cord. The convalescence was satisfactory.\nTwo months later a second operation was performed.\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?",
      "complex_cot": "\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\nDr. Richard W. Erbe:\\* The father of this 33-year-old man died at the age of 35 years of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, and we have all the evidence necessary to confirm that diagnosis in the patient under discussion. Eye involvement was recognized at the age of 14 years and culminated in blindness by the age of 28 years. Hemangioblastomas of the cerebellum were first apparent at the age of 21 years and by the age of 29 years involved the cerebellum and much of the spinal cord. A lumbar arachnoid cyst excised at the age of 32 years was associated with permanent neurologic impairment. Increasing pain in the lower extremities and deterioration of his gait led to the recent admission.The long and fascinating history of the recognition of this disorder has been elegantly described in the review of Melmon and Rosen[1](#core-r001) in 1964 and at one of these clinicopathological exercises in 1966.[2](#core-r002) The basic clinical and pathological features of the syndrome were clearly delineated in 1926 by Lindau,[3](#core-r003) who described the association of the retinal, neurovascular and visceral components. Our knowledge has advanced little since that time. The disorder is inherited in a mendelian autosomal dominant pattern, usually with a delay in the appearance of the major manifestations until the second or third decade of life or even later. The expression of this syndrome varies in the affected persons within and among families. Among the major serious manifestations great concern is focused on the angiomatous tumors of the cerebellum, the medulla oblongata and the spinal cord.Dr. Roberson, will you show us the neuroradiologic abnormalities found in this patient?Dr. Glenn H. Roberson: The angiograms of the cervical region from the study four years before admission disclose a small blush reflecting a vascular lesion within a large syrinx of the cervical spinal cord. The supplying vessel is the vertebral artery, radiculomedullary branches of which also supply a small component of a considerably larger mass occupying much of the cervical spinal cord. An angiogram taken after partial resection of the cervical lesion shows considerable diminution in the size of the vascular lesion. Over the years several vertebral angiograms were obtained to demonstrate the contents of the posterior fossa. Films from the study four years ago disclose 10 small hemangioblastomas in the cerebellum. A film from the study one year later shows a very large cystic hemangioblastoma, and there are multiple small blushes indicating the presence of several other tumors of this type.The myelograms ([Fig. 1](#f001)) obtained on admission demonstrate a large mass contiguous with the conus medullaris at the level of the first lumbar and 12th thoracic vertebras. In addition, dilated vessels extend into the mid-thoracic region. In the cervical region there is enlargement to the spinal cord, with numerous dilated vessels. A spinal angiographic examination ([Fig. 2](#f002)) with selective injection in the left eighth intercostal artery filled the radiculomedullary magna artery of Adamkiewicz and the anterior spinal artery, which is shown to supply the mass demonstrated on the myelograms.Dr. Erbe: In view of the extent of the neurovascular involvement it is surprising that this man did not have more marked clinical manifestations.A less frequent but still serious concern in cases of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is the development of one or more renal-cell carcinomas, which can metastasize, or the appearance of a pheochromocytoma. There are suggestions that this patient's kidneys were affected. Dr. Waltman, will you review the renal radiologic studies?Dr. Arthur C. Waltman: The intravenous pyelograms demonstrate extraparenchymal calcification over the lateral margin of the upper pole of the right kidney and very faint calcification in the inferior hilar lip, which appears on the tomograms to be within the kidney, suggesting a neoplasm and leading to a selective right renal angiographic study. A frame from this study ([Fig. 3](#f003)) demonstrates a cluster of vessels in the upper pole, and later films show additional intrarenal vascular masses, including a poorly defined 3-cm mass in the inferior hilar lip. A selective angiogram of the left kidney demonstrates small lesions distributed throughout. There are several avascular cortical lesions in both kidneys consistent with simple cysts.In summary, the films show multiple vascular lesions in both kidneys, all of them less than 1 cm in diameter except for the poorly defined lesion of the inferior hilar lip of the right kidney.Dr. Erbe: The first manifestation of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome in this patient was a left retinal hemangioma at the age of 14 years, earlier than the usual age at onset in the mid-20's. Characteristically, examination of the ocular fundi reveals dilated, tortuous arteries entering the vascular mass and veins leaving it. The lesion is more often peripheral than central, and it may calcify, unlike the vascular tumors in the brain. The retinal hemangioma tends to progress from asymptomatic to hemorrhagic, with the development of retinal detachment, glaucoma, cataract, uveitis and blindness. Enucleation is usually necessaryfor relief of the pain. Retinal hemangioblastomas are multiple in about a third of the cases and may be bilateral. Some patients appear to have no ocular involvement on clinical examination, but small angiomas may be detected at autopsy.At the age of 21 years a left cerebellar hemangioblastoma was removed. We are not told of the associated symptoms, but most often the first manifestation is headache, usually occipital or suboccipital. It may be followed by signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and evidence of cerebellar dysfunction, notably a disturbance of gait, vertigo and vomiting. The cerebellar hemangioblastoma is the lesion that is most often fatal. It is generally easy to identify at operation since it is usually near the surface of the cerebellum and associated with striking hypertrophy of the afferent and efferent blood vessels. It is more often cystic than solid and is almost always sharply demarcated; rarely, it is locally invasive. It may be multiple, as in this case. Spinal-cord involvement was apparent when the patient was first seen at this hospital at the age of 29 years, and the entire cord was affected. In cases of this disorder the lower cervical and lower thoracic segments are most often involved. The site of origin of the tumor is usually the posterior intramedullary region or the pia. The intramedullary hemangioblastomas are generally accompanied by syringomyelia. Less often, the intradural portions of the spinal-nerve roots and the cauda equina are affected.I shall consider next the patient's intra-abdominal problem. In this syndrome angiomas characteristically occur in the adrenal gland and liver as well as the epididymis, in the lung or on the face. Multiple cysts, not always vascular, may be present in the pancreas, the kidneys, the adrenal glands, the epididymis and elsewhere. The development of renal-cell carcinoma is a serious complication, which frequently does not appear until relatively late in the course of the disease. The tumors may be multiple and bilateral and are often asynchronous in their appearance. A pheochromocytoma occurs in some of the patients and generally remains undetected for a long period. In this case the radiographic findings suggest both cystic and hemangioblastic involvement of the kidneys, more prominent on the right side. Furthermore, the changes in the right kidney strongly suggest the presence of a renal-cell carcinoma. Hence, the final operation mentioned in the case record was probably a renal exploration. I suggest that the surgeons found a renal-cell carcinoma, possibly multiple, of the right kidney and removed that kidney. The nodule in the right lung may have been an angioma, a cyst or metastatic renal-cell carcinoma.This patient has suffered nearly all the unfortunate consequences of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, and the diagnosis is clear. What about the diagnosis in the patients with less extensive involvement? Is anything known about siblings of the patient?Dr. William R. Welch: He has a sister, who was not examined here; we assume that she does not have any manifestations of the syndrome. He has a 12-year-old son, who has not yet been examined. As already mentioned, his father died of the disease, and the patient stated that a paternal great aunt who lived in Sweden may have had it.Dr. Erbe: Since the patient's father had the syndrome the siblings have a 50 per cent risk of having inherited the gene and should undergo neurologic and intravenous pyelographic examination. Measurement of the hematocrit might also be useful since it may be increased early in the presence of either cerebellar hemangioblastoma or renal-cell carcinoma. If the results are normal those at risk for the syndrome should be followed, with these evaluations repeated annually.[1,4](#core-r001)In regard to the differential diagnosis, several other disorders that have some of the features of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome have long presented problems in classification. In 1923 Van der Hoeve[5](#core-r005) introduced the term \"phakomatoses,\" derived from the Greek \"phakos,\" meaning birthmark or spot, for tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis, and he later extended the designation to include von Hippel-Lindau disease. In their review in 1964 Melmon and Rosen[1](#core-r001) stated that these disorders along with the Sturge-Weber syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia could be grouped under the heading of either the phakomatoses, indicating their origin largely from one germ layer, or the neurocutaneous syndromes. The classification has continued to be problematic in view of the lack of information about the fundamental molecular and embryologic defects in these disorders. Recently, Smith[6](#core-r006) has suggested that the term \"phakomatoses\" be discarded since there is no apparent similarity among these diseases from the viewpoint of their causes and proposed that they be included in a larger group termed \"hamartoses.\" Hamartosis, according to Smith, denotes an organizational defect leading to an abnormal admixture of tissues, often with excessive proliferation, sometimes frankly neoplastic, of one or more components. The von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis are clinically distinct but are all inherited in a mendelian autosomal dominant pattern. The Sturge-Weber syndrome is characterized by flat facial hemangiomas and meningeal hemangiomas with seizures but is a sporadic disorder rarely affecting more than one member of a family and with no clear pattern of inheritance.[7](#core-r007) The hamartoses also include the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, the basal-cell-nevus syndrome, the multiple lentigines syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia, Type 3, and other genetic and sporadic disorders.[6](#core-r006)Genetic counseling of patients with the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome must take into consideration several important features of this disorder. This simplest is the autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Each affected male or female patient has a 50 per cent risk on each pregnancy of transmitting the gene to a son or a daughter. The timing and extent of its expression, however, vary considerably in different persons who inherit the gene. The age at the onset of neurologic or ocular signs and symptoms ranges from the teens to over 50 years.[1](#core-r001) Prepubertal abnormalities have not been reported. The variable, late onset together with the difficulties in the clinical detection of some of the abnormalities often make it difficult to determine who has and who has not inherited the gene. The diagnosis is more often suspected if the family history is positive, and the diagnosis in any given patient may be missed if other relatives are not also examined carefully or if the family history is ignored.At present there are no clues to the molecular mechanism by which the von Hippel-Lindau gene exerts its effects. In dominantly inherited neurofibromatosis, however, studies by Fialkow et al.[8](#core-r008) have yielded information about the number of cells from which neurofibromas originate. These tumors were obtained from women heterozygous for the A and B genes at the X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase locus. The tumors that had originated from single cells would be expected to exhibit either the A or the B type of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, whereas the presence of both A and B types would suggest a multicellular origin. Each of 14 neurofibromas from the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase heterozygotes contained both the A and B types of enzyme, strongly suggesting a multicellular origin, estimated to involve several hundred cells. This finding may indicate that neurofibromas arise in response to a tumorigenic factor that affects a relatively large number of cells, perhaps in the form of a growth-promoting agent that could even be produced elsewhere in the body. An alternative interpretation is that a single cell is affected initially and stimulates adjacent normal cells to form the neurofibroma. In contrast, a single patient with dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia, Type 2, proved to have only the B type of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in both a medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland and a pheochromocytoma, indicating a clonal origin for each tumor.[9](#core-r009) To date, these are the only hereditary tumors studied in this way.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Bodnar, will you give us the medical students' diagnoses?Dr. Andrew G. Bodnar: The students who reviewed the case thought that the operation was a renal biopsy. In view of the marked vascularity demonstrated on the angiographic examination they believed than an open biopsy was done with a view to total nephrectomy if, as the students thought likely, the diagnosis proved to be multiple, bilateral renal-cell carcinomas in addition to benign cysts. They suggested that the pulmonary nodule might be metastatic renal-cell carcinoma, and the pancreatic calcifications were ascribed to benign cystic disease. They attributed the burning pain in the lower extremities to the carcinomatous polyneuropathy that may accompany renal-cell carcinoma.\n\nPathological Discussion\n-----------------------\n\nDr. Welch: Examination of the cerebellar hemangioblastomas revealed solid areas composed of small capillaries lined by plump endothelial cells separated by interstitial or \"stromal\" cells with abundant, often vacuolated lipid-rich cytoplasm (Fig. [4](#f004) and [5](#f005)). A fine reticulin network invested most of the cells and capillaries. This type of tumor accounts for 1 to 2.5 per cent of intracranial neoplasms and is encountered in 10 to 20 per cent of the cases of von Hippel-Lindau disease.[10](#core-r010) The hemangioblastomas in this disorder are often multiple, with the retina and cerebellum the most common sites of involvement, followed by the spinal cord[11](#core-r011) and the medulla. Rare examples of this tumor have been reported in a supratentorial location,[12,13](#core-r012) and one was found in the pituitary gland.[14](#core-r014)These tumors may be predominantly solid but more often are predominantly cystic. Typically, the tumor presents as a red nodule in the wall of a well circumscribed, fluid-filled cyst. The spongy consistence, red color and evidence of old hemorrhage attest to the highly vascular nature of the nodule. The cyst fluid has been shown to have erythropoietic activity by several assay technics, and the erythrocytosis occasionally observed in patients with this type of tumor is thought to be caused by an erythropoietinlike factor elaborated by the neoplastic cells.[15,16](#core-r015) On microscopical examination of several of the tumors in this case foci of extramedullary erythropoiesis as well as occasional mitotic figures and giant stromal cells with bizarre hyperchromatic nuclei were found. The low level of mitotic activity and lack of cellular pleomorphism correlate with the usual benign behavior of the tumors, but the few that have behaved in a malignant fashion were also benign in appearance.[17](#core-r017)The results of ultrastructural and tissue-culture studies are in substantial agreement that there are three cell types, all neoplastic, in both the cerebellar[18,19](#core-r018) and the retinal hemangioblastomas.[20](#core-r020) Endothelial cells, pericytes and stromal cells appear distinct by electron microscopy, and each proliferates independently in tissue culture.[18](#core-r018) The endothelial lining has small fenestrae, which may permit leakage of plasma lipid imbibed by stromal cells.[20](#core-r020) The xanthomatous appearance of the stromal cells on light microscopical examination suggests to some investigators that they are macrophages, but the histochemical reactions are said to exclude an origin from reticuloendothelial, microglial or neuroglial cells. Electronmicroscopical examination demonstrates that these cells contain intracytoplasmic microfilaments and numerous lipid droplets, and basement-membrane material is absent or scanty. One reasonable hypothesis for the origin of all the cells is that the tumor arises from primitive vasoformative elements,[18,19](#core-r018) and the stromal cells are histogenetically related to the endothelial cells and pericytes. In contrast, ultrastructural evidence of an origin of the stromal cells from fibrous astrocytes has also been presented.[20](#core-r020)The second operation was exploration of the left kidney by Dr. Niall M. Heney, followed several days later by exploration of the right kidney and the right lung by Dr. Heney and Dr. Earle W. Wilkins, Jr., via a thoracoabdominal approach. Each kidney contained several cystic and solid yellow-gray nodules, 1 to 3 cm in diameter, several of which were submitted for pathological examination. The pulmonary lesion shown on the tomograms was difficult to find; palpation of the right lower lobe disclosed an evulsive, soft, rubbery nodule that collapsed and disappeared during an attempt at enucleation. There was no evidence of a pulmonary vascular malformation. The pancreas was multicystic but with no indication of a tumor, and no attempt at biopsy or aspiration was made.The specimens from the kidneys disclosed three patterns of disease. Examination of six solid and two cystic nodules surrounded by fibrous pseudocapsules revealed the typical clear-cell pattern of renal-cell carcinoma ([Fig. 6](#f006)). In four other nodules, each surrounded by a fibrous pseudocapsule, we found no evidence of viable tumor. They were composed of loose fibrous tissue with occasional foci of dystrophic calcification, and in some of these nodules ghost cells consistent with regressing tumor cells were noted. The third pattern, seen in a single specimen, was that of a thin-walled cyst lined by atypical epithelium. Although not frankly malignant, this atypical epithelium may represent a preneoplastic change. Renal tumors have been multiple in some of the reported cases,[21,22](#core-r021) and invasion and metastasis are well documented.[2,22](#core-r002)The microscopical examination of the specimen from the right lung showed parenchyma and a tiny epithelium-lined space. Pulmonary cysts are occasionally mentioned in connection with the von Hippel-Lindau constellation,[1,22](#core-r001) and this small space may have been a daughter cyst of a larger collapsed cyst palpated at operation.An interesting component of von Hippel-Lindau disease not present in the case under discussion but found in a small proportion of male patients with the disease is an unusual tumor of the epididymis designated \"papillary cystadenoma\" by Sherrick,[23](#core-r023) in 1956. In an excellent review in 1971 Price[24](#core-r024) concluded that this tumor should be considered a true component of von Hippel-Lindau disease and pointed out that most of the patients with bilateral involvement have the syndrome, whereas those with unilateral papillary cystadenomas usually have an isolated lesion. This tumor is benign.[24,25](#core-r024) No homologous tumor has been described in female patients with the disease, but in Dr. Scully's consultation files I have seen one example of bilateral papillary cystadenomas of the broad ligament, presumably of mesonephric origin, in a woman with this disorder, indicating involvement of mesonephric-duct derivatives in both sexes.\n",
