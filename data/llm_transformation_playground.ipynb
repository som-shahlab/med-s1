      "Dr. Richard B. Colletti[\\*](#FN1): I shall discuss the common causes of hematochezia, the difficulty of making a diagnosis in cases of bleeding of the small intestine, and the types of vascular lesions that often result in obscure bleeding.Anal fissure, a colonic polyp, and proctitis are common causes of childhood hematochezia, but they are readily detectable and rarely lead to anemia. Juvenile polyps, which typically cause painless hematochezia, can be diagnosed and removed by colonoscopic polypectomy.[1](#core-r001) Anemia accompanied by hematochezia suggests a Meckel's diverticulum, which according to the rule of twos, occurs in 2 percent of births, is 2 inches (5 cm) long and located 2 feet (60 cm) proximal to the ileocecal valve, and is 2 times more common in males than in females.[2](#core-r002) A radionuclide scan with pertechnetate is diagnostic in 95 percent of the cases in which ectopic gastric mucosa is present, and laparotomy confirms the diagnosis in the remainder. Inflammatory bowel disease is a common cause of hematochezia, but the associated abdominal pain and diarrhea were absent in this case.[3](#core-r003) Other indicators of inflammatory bowel disease, which were also absent, are radiographic evidence of mural thickening, a stricture, or a fistula of the small intestine; endoscopic evidence of mucosal granularity, ulceration, hemorrhage, or exudate; and a biopsy finding of disruption of the glandular architecture, infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes, or granulomas. The results of CT scanning and laparotomy rule out a bowel duplication as the cause of bleeding in this case.[4](#core-r004)The presence of hematochezia without hematemesis or blood in the gastric aspirate does not suggest a source of bleeding above the ligament of Treitz, although rapid, profuse, intermittent bleeding could have originated at any site distal to the pylorus. Esophageal varices and peptic ulcer disease caused by either *Helicobacter pylori* or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs would have been seen during endoscopy.[5](#core-r005) The clinical course is also inconsistent with intussusception, which typically causes severe colicky abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant in older children, without profuse bleeding. Schönlein–Henoch purpura, characterized by a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but skin lesions are generally present either at the onset of the illness or within six weeks thereafter, and purpura of the bowel may be detected by endoscopy.[6](#core-r006) There is also no evidence of either the hemolytic–uremic syndrome, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, uremia, and hemorrhagic colitis, or the Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which a factitious illness is reported or simulated by a parent.Bleeding from the biliary tree, which is rare in children, can be caused by trauma, a neoplasm, a gallstone, a hepatic aneurysm, an abscess, or a vascular lesion. Bleeding from the pancreas is even more rare. Hematobilia, however, typically causes upper gastrointestinal bleeding, often with biliary colic or jaundice, and hepatobiliary lesions are generally detectable by CT scanning or angiographic examination.Congenital hemangiomas of the bowel, either isolated or in the form of diffuse hemangiomatosis, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, usually in the first decade of life. Cutaneous lesions are often absent. Bowel hemangiomas may be very difficult to detect by endoscopic, radiographic, or CT examination but are generally seen at laparotomy. Patients with the Klippel–Trénaunay–Weber syndrome, which is characterized by cutaneous hemangiomas and limb hypertrophy, occasionally have bleeding from bowel lesions, particularly in the rectum. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, characterized by bluish cutaneous and gastrointestinal cavernous hemangiomas, is another rare but endoscopically detectable cause of bleeding.[7](#core-r007)Adolescents may have disorders that are more common in adults than in children, such as a hemorrhoid, a neoplasm, a diverticulum, or angiodysplasia. Hemorrhoidal thrombosis causes pain as well as bleeding but rarely causes anemia and is detectable on physical examination or by anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Neoplasms cause chronic occult bleeding more often than they cause hematochezia. In adults, diverticulosis and vascular ectasias account for more than 60 percent of major lower intestinal hemorrhages. Abrupt, painless, severe bleeding from diverticulosis originates most often in a large artery in the proximal colon and is detected by colonoscopy or angiography.[8](#core-r008)Other, less frequent causes of bleeding include a solitary rectal ulcer, colonic varices, mesenteric vascular insufficiency, and an aortoenteric fistula. Endometriosis of the bowel wall, particularly the rectum or distal ileum, can cause cyclic lower intestinal bleeding in reproductive-age females and is difficult to diagnose.[8](#core-r008) None of these disorders were apparent in this case, however, and the bleeding was not related to menses.The endoscopic and operative findings in this patient strongly suggest bleeding from the small intestine, the region of the bowel that is most difficult to study. Lesions in the small intestine often bleed slowly or intermittently, and its length, intraperitoneal location, vigorous contractility, and overlying loops hinder early diagnosis.[9](#core-r009) Contrast radiography of the small bowel, even with enteroclysis, detects obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in only 5 to 10 percent of cases. Radionuclide scanning of technetium-labeled red cells can be used to locate blood within the small bowel. Identifying the precise location of bleeding is difficult, however, and misleading information may result from the detection of pooled blood distal to the source of bleeding.[9,10](#core-r009)Angiography can detect bleeding at a rate as low as 0.5 ml per minute and can demonstrate massively bleeding lesions in the small and large bowel in over half the cases. When a bleeding lesion is identified, intraoperative injection of methylene-blue dye in a precisely positioned angiographic catheter can enable the surgeon to locate the source of hemorrhage and resect the shortest possible segment of small intestine.[11](#core-r011) A surgical exploration with palpation and transillumination of the small bowel but without other intraoperative techniques detects obscure causes of gastrointestinal bleeding, usually large vascular abnormalities or submucosal tumors, in only 10 percent of cases.[9,12](#core-r009)It is difficult to examine the small intestine endoscopically. A colonoscope can be used for upper endoscopic examination and advanced 40 to 60 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz by a technique called push enteroscopy. Specially designed enteroscopes can be pushed 80 to 120 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz. With sonde enteroscopy, the instrument has a balloon at the tip. When the balloon is propelled by peristalsis, it slowly traverses most of the small intestine, which can be viewed as the instrument is withdrawn.[13,14](#core-r013) Enteroscopy can identify obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in nearly 40 percent of cases. Intraoperative enteroscopy, in which a colonoscope is advanced to the proximal jejunum, where the surgeon aligns short segments of small bowel for visualization until the ileocecal valve is reached, is the most effective technique for endoscopic examination, with more than 80 percent of small-bowel lesions identified in this manner.[15,16](#core-r015) Potential complications include mucosal lacerations, perforation, and prolonged ileus. Rebleeding occurs in up to 45 percent of cases.The small intestine between the ligament of Treitz and the ileocecal valve is involved in only 3 to 5 percent of cases of major gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. Angiodysplasia accounts for 70 to 80 percent of cases of bleeding of the small intestine in adults; tumors, primarily leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas, account for 5 to 10 percent; and other vascular lesions account for less than 5 percent.[9](#core-r009)Angiodysplasia, characterized by a cluster of vessels, is found predominantly in the cecum and ascending colon in patients over the age of 60 years. The disorder is associated with aging, although it has been reported in young adults. In the early stages, the lesion consists of ectatic, distorted, thin-walled veins, venules, and capillaries in the submucosa, and it can progress to involve the mucosa. Enlarged arteries and thick-walled veins are seen in the advanced stage, which is less common. Routine histopathological examination detects fewer than a third of these lesions; special techniques, including the injection of colonic vessels with silicon rubber, are necessary to detect the remainder.[17](#core-r017)Angiodysplasia may also be difficult to detect by endoscopy, since other lesions, such as telangiectasia, colitis, and artifacts created by trauma or suction, may simulate it. Endoscopic visualization of angiodysplasia and other vascular lesions may be impaired by hypovolemia, which can be caused by bleeding or by the administration of meperidine during endoscopy. Angiographic examination can identify actively bleeding lesions, as well as some lesions that have stopped bleeding. Although angiographic examination often reveals colonic angiodysplasia, it rarely detects small-bowel angiodysplasia, which is diagnosed by either enteroscopy or intraoperative endoscopy.[9,18](#core-r009)In addition to hemangiomas, vascular lesions of the small intestine include arteriovenous malformations, connective-tissue disorders, and telangiectasia. Arteriovenous malformations, which contain thick-walled arteries and veins without capillaries, are congenital and occur in the young. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by degeneration of elastic fibers of the skin, eyes, and arteries, with thickening of the skin, angioid retinal streaks, and vascular occlusion. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur in children as young as five years of age, as a result of the rupture of dilated mucosal and submucosal veins and capillaries as well as arteries.[7,19](#core-r007) The Ehlers–Danlos syndrome can result in spontaneous arterial and intestinal rupture due to a defect in collagen synthesis, as well as hyperelasticity of the skin and joints and mitral-valve prolapse.[20](#core-r020)Telangiectasia (localized dilatation of capillaries and venules) in the small intestine can be associated with Turner's syndrome and can be a component of the CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In Turner's syndrome, telangiectasia has a predilection for the small bowel. Bleeding is uncommon, usually intermittent, and self-limited, but it can be severe and persistent.[21](#core-r021) Lesions may be detected by endoscopic examination but are found more often at laparotomy. The diagnosis is based on a 45,X karyotype and phenotypic features that include short stature, transient congenital lymphedema, widely spaced nipples, a webbed neck, cubitus valgus, and gonadal dysgenesis. Features of both the CREST syndrome and Turner's syndrome were absent in this child.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia comprises a group of autosomal dominant disorders of blood vessels of the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, and brain.[22](#core-r022) Early lesions are characterized by focal dilatations of postcapillary venules. When the disorder is fully developed, the venules are markedly dilated and convoluted, have no elastic fibers, and often communicate directly with dilated arterioles; true arteriovenous malformations are infrequent. The earliest sign of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is usually epistaxis, which is present in about half the patients by the age of 20 years; cutaneous telangiectasia is detectable in about half the patients by the age of 30 years. Approximately a quarter of the patients have visceral involvement, and in about 10 percent of those with visceral involvement, it precedes other manifestations.[23,24](#core-r023) Lesions may be found in the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, or colon, usually beginning in the fifth or sixth decade of life.[25](#core-r025) Bleeding may be severe, requiring many transfusions. Hepatic arteriovenous malformations can result in high-output cardiac failure.[26](#core-r026) In rare cases, a lesion of the ampulla of Vater causes bleeding.[27](#core-r027) In one series, 15 percent of the patients had gastrointestinal manifestations, beginning between the ages of 8 and 87 years, but less than 2 percent had such manifestations before the age of 30 years. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the initial manifestation in 1 percent of the patients. Recurrent bleeding was common and was fatal in some cases.[23](#core-r023)The typical endoscopic finding in patients with gastrointestinal hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is multiple, small, red, well-defined, flat nodules, often with stellate projections and an “anemic halo.” The lesions may resemble those of erosive gastritis or iatrogenic lesions of the mucosa. In a minority of the reported cases, there is no visible external lesion or family history of the disorder.[25,28](#core-r025)Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia rarely presents in childhood. It has been reported in a 10-month-old infant with gastric involvement and hematemesis.[29](#core-r029) In four children between one and five years of age, bleeding from colonic telangiectasia preceded the development of skin lesions or epistaxis.[30](#core-r030) A one-year-old infant presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatobiliary vascular anomalies.[31](#core-r031) Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has also been reported in a nine-year-old girl,[32](#core-r032) and there have been case reports of pulmonary, brain, and urinary tract complications during the first decade of life.The patient under discussion may have had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In the absence of neoplasia, inflammation, or ulceration of the small intestine, the source of the bleeding was probably a vascular lesion. No hemangioma, arteriovenous malformation, or angiodysplasia was apparent, and there were no signs of a connective-tissue disorder or Turner's syndrome. A family history of orocutaneous telangiectasia, recurrent bleeding, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemoptysis might have been revealing, as well as examination of first- and second-degree relatives for evidence of the disease. When the patient had hematuria in infancy, cystoscopy might have detected telangiectasia of the urinary bladder. The patient had no manifestations of biliary disease, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography could have been performed to determine whether the ampulla of Vater or biliary tree was involved.Microscopical examination of the resected jejunal lesion showed no abnormal vessels. However, it may be difficult to diagnose angiodysplasia, an arteriovenous malformation, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia on the basis of histologic studies. If the patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, at least one additional lesion must have continued to bleed postoperatively, either in the area of friable mucosa in the terminal ileum or at another site.If a lesion characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia had been found, what would the therapeutic options have been? Anecdotal reports and prospective studies suggest that treatment with an estrogen–progesterone combination can prevent or decrease bleeding in some cases.[33,34](#core-r033) Aminocaproic acid, a potent inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system, decreased the frequency of bleeding episodes in two patients, perhaps by enabling fibrin to seal the bleeding sites.[35](#core-r035) Those two patients had no abnormalities of platelet aggregation or factor VIII–von Willebrand factor complex, which have been reported in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Desmopressin was effective in one patient with massive gastrointestinal bleeding from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and reduced levels of von Willebrand factor who had not had a response to treatment with cryoprecipitate.[36](#core-r036) In this case, however, if bleeding that required multiple transfusions had continued, intraoperative endoscopy and either ablative therapy or resection would have been necessary. In conclusion, this patient probably had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia involving the small intestine.\n",

      "Dr. Carolyn C. Compton: The diagnostic procedure was a right-sided ileocolectomy. Examination of the specimen showed maroon-to-red mucosal blebs in the cecum and right colon ([Figure 1](#f01)). Microscopical examination of the blebs revealed blood-filled spaces that were part of an extensive plexus of thin-walled ectatic vessels, primarily involving the muscularis mucosae and superficial submucosa. Ectatic vessels traversed the muscularis mucosae, splitting its smooth-muscle fibers ([Figure 2](#f02)). These vessels had ruptured focally, with acute hemorrhage and sloughing of the overlying mucosa. Smaller vessels of identical appearance were also present focally in the muscularis propria.Immunohistochemical stains for factor VIII showed a single layer of endothelium lining the abnormal vessels ([Figure 3](#f03)). Trichrome staining confirmed the absence of smooth muscle in the vessel walls and the paucity of collagen in the perivascular connective tissue, and elastic-tissue staining showed an absence of elastic fibers ([Figure 4](#f04)). No vessels with abnormalities of the muscle layers, such as arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms, were identified. The telangiectatic lesions were characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or Osler–Weber–Rendu disease.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia occurs in all races, with an estimated frequency of 1 case per 2300 persons to 1 per 39,000, depending on the population studied.[22](#core-r022) Although the pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant, 20 percent of the patients do not have a family history of the disorder.[29](#core-r029) Approximately 10 percent of affected persons are asymptomatic and never report bleeding.[37](#core-r037)The vascular dysplasias encompassed by this disease include, in addition to telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, venous varicosities, arteriovenous fistulas, and aneurysms. The relative frequency of these lesions varies among affected families.The pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia has not yet been fully elucidated, but genetic studies have shown that it is a family of disorders caused by mutations in various genes.[22](#core-r022) Thus far, genetic linkages have been established at chromosome 9q33–q34 in some families[38,39](#core-r038) and at chromosome 12q in others.[40,41](#core-r040) A mutation of the gene for endoglin, the most abundant transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)–binding protein on endothelial-cell membranes, has been identified as a specific molecular abnormality in one form of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.[42](#core-r042) Current data suggest that the mutation of this gene, located at chromosome 9q3, results in either reduced production of normal protein or production of a protein that interferes with the normal function of endoglin. Presumably, with the loss of normal endoglin-binding function, endothelial-cell responses to TGF-β, including the migration, proliferation, adhesion, and production or organization of the extracellular matrix, are impaired, leading to vascular dysplasias.Dr. Harland S. Winter: Additional information became available after the diagnostic procedure had been performed. The child's maternal grandfather had epistaxis as a teenager and occasionally as an adult. An otolaryngologist identified telangiectasias in one of the grandfather's ears and in his nose and lower lip when he was 67 years old. Also, a maternal uncle had a history of recurrent nosebleeds, but examination of his nose by an otolaryngologist showed no abnormalities. Two of five maternal aunts had intermittent epistaxis, but neither has been evaluated by an otolaryngologist. None of the patient's first cousins have reported bleeding.Dr. Lewis B. Holmes: Several aspects of this child's story were instructive from the standpoint of a clinical geneticist. When she was hospitalized initially, there was no reported family history of disorders suggesting hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Later, we learned that one grandparent had had nosebleeds. The issue was finally resolved when an otolaryngologist who was familiar with the appearance of nasal telangiectases in this disease examined the potentially affected relatives. This experience underscores the importance of pursuing the family history carefully and consulting knowledgeable examiners. Haitjema et al.[43](#core-r043) have shown that many asymptomatic family members who may carry the gene for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can benefit from careful screening, since it often reveals clinically important, treatable lesions.The importance of the extra effort made to identify affected family members in this case is reminiscent of the experience with tuberous sclerosis, another autosomal dominant disorder in which the diagnosis is typically made first in the most severely affected child in the family. A cursory family history at that time may be negative. In one study,[44](#core-r044) careful screening of the parents of affected children, including examination for subtle skin lesions characteristic of tuberous sclerosis, CT scanning of the brain to detect tubers, and ultrasonography of the kidneys to detect angiomyolipomas, showed that 4 of 26 parents (15 percent) who initially had been considered unaffected had subtle signs of the disease.It is important for clinicians to help geneticists identify extended families in which several members have a genetic disorder and are willing to participate in genetic-linkage studies, which can be important for the family. The family physician can facilitate these studies, which usually require only venipuncture.Dr. Winter: After the diagnosis had been made, radiographic studies of the lungs and brain showed no vascular abnormalities. The patient continued to pass bright red blood rectally and to require blood transfusions. Because we suspected more extensive small-bowel or colonic involvement, we administered aminocaproic acid intravenously and subsequently switched to a dose of 3.75 g orally three times daily. She is currently taking 1.5 g of aminocaproic acid three times daily. Her hematocrit is 39 percent, and she has not had any clinical evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding for nine months.\n",

       "{'original': {'Question': \"A 14-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of recurrent rectal bleeding.\\nShe had been in excellent health until three years earlier, when she began to pass blood-tinged stools. The bleeding increased during the course of several days. A proctosigmoidoscopic examination showed no abnormality. Hydrocortisone enemas were followed by the cessation of bleeding. She was then well until 45 days before admission, when her stools again became blood-tinged, and she later passed frank blood rectally. A colonoscopic examination did not reveal the source of the bleeding. Hematochezia continued. Twenty-seven days before admission, the results of an esophagogastroduodenoscopic examination at another hospital were normal. A colonoscopic examination showed blood in the rectum and ascending colon, but the source was not identified. A radionuclide scan for Meckel's diverticulum was normal.\\nOne day later, the patient was transferred to this hospital. A physical examination was normal. Another radionuclide scan for Meckel's diverticulum and an upper gastrointestinal series with a small-bowel follow-through study were normal. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal on two occasions; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\\nTable 1\\n. The rectal bleeding diminished spontaneously, and the patient was discharged on the third hospital day with instructions to take ferrous sulfate. That evening, the rectal bleeding increased, and for several days she passed fresh blood rectally. She returned to this hospital 21 days before the current admission.\\nA physical examination was again normal, except for pallor. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal on two occasions; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\\nTable 1\\n. On the second hospital day, an exploratory laparotomy revealed evidence of blood in the small bowel and in the ascending, transverse, and descending colon. A Meckel's diverticulum was not detected. A hemorrhagic area, 1 cm by 1 cm, on the antimesenteric aspect of the midportion of the jejunum was excised. An intraoperative endoscopic examination, performed by telescoping the small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve over a sterile colonoscope, revealed a friable area of mucosa in the terminal ileum. Biopsy specimens were obtained. The liver appeared normal. An incidental appendectomy was performed. After the surgery, the patient passed stools with small blood clots. She was discharged on the ninth hospital day. Microscopical examination of the biopsy specimens obtained from the hemorrhagic area of the jejunum revealed acute submucosal hemorrhage without vascular abnormalities; the appendix and the biopsy specimens obtained from the terminal ileum were normal.\\nFour days after discharge, rectal bleeding recurred and worsened progressively. One day before admission, the hematocrit was 15 percent. Three units of packed red cells were transfused. Another colonoscopic examination was normal. On the following day, the patient was readmitted to the hospital.\\nShe had had hematuria during infancy, but an evaluation had not revealed the source of the bleeding. The episodes of bleeding had not been accompanied by pain or abdominal cramps, and there was no history of fever, diarrhea, constipation, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, easy bruising, orthostatic faintness, or syncope. Two younger siblings were well.\\nThe temperature was 37°C, the pulse was 108, and the respirations were 14. The blood pressure was 110/55 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was pale but appeared well nourished and appropriately developed for her age. No oral or cutaneous lesions were seen. The head, neck, lungs, and heart were normal, as were the abdomen and arms and legs.\\nPlatelet-aggregation studies were normal. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times and the values for urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolytes were normal; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\\nTable 1\\n. A mesenteric angiographic examination showed no evidence of an arteriovenous malformation or active extravasation of contrast material. There was normal hepatic branching from the celiac axis, and the splenic and portal veins were patent. A radionuclide scan for bleeding revealed normal activity in the liver, spleen, and great vessels, without evidence of hemorrhage, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was normal.\\nHematochezia persisted, and the hematocrit fell from 27.1 to 19.3 percent. Two additional units of packed red cells were transfused.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?\",\n",
       "  'Complex_CoT': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richard B. Colletti[\\\\*](#FN1): I shall discuss the common causes of hematochezia, the difficulty of making a diagnosis in cases of bleeding of the small intestine, and the types of vascular lesions that often result in obscure bleeding.Anal fissure, a colonic polyp, and proctitis are common causes of childhood hematochezia, but they are readily detectable and rarely lead to anemia. Juvenile polyps, which typically cause painless hematochezia, can be diagnosed and removed by colonoscopic polypectomy.[1](#core-r001) Anemia accompanied by hematochezia suggests a Meckel's diverticulum, which according to the rule of twos, occurs in 2 percent of births, is 2 inches (5 cm) long and located 2 feet (60 cm) proximal to the ileocecal valve, and is 2 times more common in males than in females.[2](#core-r002) A radionuclide scan with pertechnetate is diagnostic in 95 percent of the cases in which ectopic gastric mucosa is present, and laparotomy confirms the diagnosis in the remainder. Inflammatory bowel disease is a common cause of hematochezia, but the associated abdominal pain and diarrhea were absent in this case.[3](#core-r003) Other indicators of inflammatory bowel disease, which were also absent, are radiographic evidence of mural thickening, a stricture, or a fistula of the small intestine; endoscopic evidence of mucosal granularity, ulceration, hemorrhage, or exudate; and a biopsy finding of disruption of the glandular architecture, infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes, or granulomas. The results of CT scanning and laparotomy rule out a bowel duplication as the cause of bleeding in this case.[4](#core-r004)The presence of hematochezia without hematemesis or blood in the gastric aspirate does not suggest a source of bleeding above the ligament of Treitz, although rapid, profuse, intermittent bleeding could have originated at any site distal to the pylorus. Esophageal varices and peptic ulcer disease caused by either *Helicobacter pylori* or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs would have been seen during endoscopy.[5](#core-r005) The clinical course is also inconsistent with intussusception, which typically causes severe colicky abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant in older children, without profuse bleeding. Schönlein–Henoch purpura, characterized by a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but skin lesions are generally present either at the onset of the illness or within six weeks thereafter, and purpura of the bowel may be detected by endoscopy.[6](#core-r006) There is also no evidence of either the hemolytic–uremic syndrome, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, uremia, and hemorrhagic colitis, or the Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which a factitious illness is reported or simulated by a parent.Bleeding from the biliary tree, which is rare in children, can be caused by trauma, a neoplasm, a gallstone, a hepatic aneurysm, an abscess, or a vascular lesion. Bleeding from the pancreas is even more rare. Hematobilia, however, typically causes upper gastrointestinal bleeding, often with biliary colic or jaundice, and hepatobiliary lesions are generally detectable by CT scanning or angiographic examination.Congenital hemangiomas of the bowel, either isolated or in the form of diffuse hemangiomatosis, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, usually in the first decade of life. Cutaneous lesions are often absent. Bowel hemangiomas may be very difficult to detect by endoscopic, radiographic, or CT examination but are generally seen at laparotomy. Patients with the Klippel–Trénaunay–Weber syndrome, which is characterized by cutaneous hemangiomas and limb hypertrophy, occasionally have bleeding from bowel lesions, particularly in the rectum. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, characterized by bluish cutaneous and gastrointestinal cavernous hemangiomas, is another rare but endoscopically detectable cause of bleeding.[7](#core-r007)Adolescents may have disorders that are more common in adults than in children, such as a hemorrhoid, a neoplasm, a diverticulum, or angiodysplasia. Hemorrhoidal thrombosis causes pain as well as bleeding but rarely causes anemia and is detectable on physical examination or by anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Neoplasms cause chronic occult bleeding more often than they cause hematochezia. In adults, diverticulosis and vascular ectasias account for more than 60 percent of major lower intestinal hemorrhages. Abrupt, painless, severe bleeding from diverticulosis originates most often in a large artery in the proximal colon and is detected by colonoscopy or angiography.[8](#core-r008)Other, less frequent causes of bleeding include a solitary rectal ulcer, colonic varices, mesenteric vascular insufficiency, and an aortoenteric fistula. Endometriosis of the bowel wall, particularly the rectum or distal ileum, can cause cyclic lower intestinal bleeding in reproductive-age females and is difficult to diagnose.[8](#core-r008) None of these disorders were apparent in this case, however, and the bleeding was not related to menses.The endoscopic and operative findings in this patient strongly suggest bleeding from the small intestine, the region of the bowel that is most difficult to study. Lesions in the small intestine often bleed slowly or intermittently, and its length, intraperitoneal location, vigorous contractility, and overlying loops hinder early diagnosis.[9](#core-r009) Contrast radiography of the small bowel, even with enteroclysis, detects obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in only 5 to 10 percent of cases. Radionuclide scanning of technetium-labeled red cells can be used to locate blood within the small bowel. Identifying the precise location of bleeding is difficult, however, and misleading information may result from the detection of pooled blood distal to the source of bleeding.[9,10](#core-r009)Angiography can detect bleeding at a rate as low as 0.5 ml per minute and can demonstrate massively bleeding lesions in the small and large bowel in over half the cases. When a bleeding lesion is identified, intraoperative injection of methylene-blue dye in a precisely positioned angiographic catheter can enable the surgeon to locate the source of hemorrhage and resect the shortest possible segment of small intestine.[11](#core-r011) A surgical exploration with palpation and transillumination of the small bowel but without other intraoperative techniques detects obscure causes of gastrointestinal bleeding, usually large vascular abnormalities or submucosal tumors, in only 10 percent of cases.[9,12](#core-r009)It is difficult to examine the small intestine endoscopically. A colonoscope can be used for upper endoscopic examination and advanced 40 to 60 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz by a technique called push enteroscopy. Specially designed enteroscopes can be pushed 80 to 120 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz. With sonde enteroscopy, the instrument has a balloon at the tip. When the balloon is propelled by peristalsis, it slowly traverses most of the small intestine, which can be viewed as the instrument is withdrawn.[13,14](#core-r013) Enteroscopy can identify obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in nearly 40 percent of cases. Intraoperative enteroscopy, in which a colonoscope is advanced to the proximal jejunum, where the surgeon aligns short segments of small bowel for visualization until the ileocecal valve is reached, is the most effective technique for endoscopic examination, with more than 80 percent of small-bowel lesions identified in this manner.[15,16](#core-r015) Potential complications include mucosal lacerations, perforation, and prolonged ileus. Rebleeding occurs in up to 45 percent of cases.The small intestine between the ligament of Treitz and the ileocecal valve is involved in only 3 to 5 percent of cases of major gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. Angiodysplasia accounts for 70 to 80 percent of cases of bleeding of the small intestine in adults; tumors, primarily leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas, account for 5 to 10 percent; and other vascular lesions account for less than 5 percent.[9](#core-r009)Angiodysplasia, characterized by a cluster of vessels, is found predominantly in the cecum and ascending colon in patients over the age of 60 years. The disorder is associated with aging, although it has been reported in young adults. In the early stages, the lesion consists of ectatic, distorted, thin-walled veins, venules, and capillaries in the submucosa, and it can progress to involve the mucosa. Enlarged arteries and thick-walled veins are seen in the advanced stage, which is less common. Routine histopathological examination detects fewer than a third of these lesions; special techniques, including the injection of colonic vessels with silicon rubber, are necessary to detect the remainder.[17](#core-r017)Angiodysplasia may also be difficult to detect by endoscopy, since other lesions, such as telangiectasia, colitis, and artifacts created by trauma or suction, may simulate it. Endoscopic visualization of angiodysplasia and other vascular lesions may be impaired by hypovolemia, which can be caused by bleeding or by the administration of meperidine during endoscopy. Angiographic examination can identify actively bleeding lesions, as well as some lesions that have stopped bleeding. Although angiographic examination often reveals colonic angiodysplasia, it rarely detects small-bowel angiodysplasia, which is diagnosed by either enteroscopy or intraoperative endoscopy.[9,18](#core-r009)In addition to hemangiomas, vascular lesions of the small intestine include arteriovenous malformations, connective-tissue disorders, and telangiectasia. Arteriovenous malformations, which contain thick-walled arteries and veins without capillaries, are congenital and occur in the young. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by degeneration of elastic fibers of the skin, eyes, and arteries, with thickening of the skin, angioid retinal streaks, and vascular occlusion. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur in children as young as five years of age, as a result of the rupture of dilated mucosal and submucosal veins and capillaries as well as arteries.[7,19](#core-r007) The Ehlers–Danlos syndrome can result in spontaneous arterial and intestinal rupture due to a defect in collagen synthesis, as well as hyperelasticity of the skin and joints and mitral-valve prolapse.[20](#core-r020)Telangiectasia (localized dilatation of capillaries and venules) in the small intestine can be associated with Turner's syndrome and can be a component of the CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In Turner's syndrome, telangiectasia has a predilection for the small bowel. Bleeding is uncommon, usually intermittent, and self-limited, but it can be severe and persistent.[21](#core-r021) Lesions may be detected by endoscopic examination but are found more often at laparotomy. The diagnosis is based on a 45,X karyotype and phenotypic features that include short stature, transient congenital lymphedema, widely spaced nipples, a webbed neck, cubitus valgus, and gonadal dysgenesis. Features of both the CREST syndrome and Turner's syndrome were absent in this child.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia comprises a group of autosomal dominant disorders of blood vessels of the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, and brain.[22](#core-r022) Early lesions are characterized by focal dilatations of postcapillary venules. When the disorder is fully developed, the venules are markedly dilated and convoluted, have no elastic fibers, and often communicate directly with dilated arterioles; true arteriovenous malformations are infrequent. The earliest sign of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is usually epistaxis, which is present in about half the patients by the age of 20 years; cutaneous telangiectasia is detectable in about half the patients by the age of 30 years. Approximately a quarter of the patients have visceral involvement, and in about 10 percent of those with visceral involvement, it precedes other manifestations.[23,24](#core-r023) Lesions may be found in the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, or colon, usually beginning in the fifth or sixth decade of life.[25](#core-r025) Bleeding may be severe, requiring many transfusions. Hepatic arteriovenous malformations can result in high-output cardiac failure.[26](#core-r026) In rare cases, a lesion of the ampulla of Vater causes bleeding.[27](#core-r027) In one series, 15 percent of the patients had gastrointestinal manifestations, beginning between the ages of 8 and 87 years, but less than 2 percent had such manifestations before the age of 30 years. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the initial manifestation in 1 percent of the patients. Recurrent bleeding was common and was fatal in some cases.[23](#core-r023)The typical endoscopic finding in patients with gastrointestinal hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is multiple, small, red, well-defined, flat nodules, often with stellate projections and an “anemic halo.” The lesions may resemble those of erosive gastritis or iatrogenic lesions of the mucosa. In a minority of the reported cases, there is no visible external lesion or family history of the disorder.[25,28](#core-r025)Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia rarely presents in childhood. It has been reported in a 10-month-old infant with gastric involvement and hematemesis.[29](#core-r029) In four children between one and five years of age, bleeding from colonic telangiectasia preceded the development of skin lesions or epistaxis.[30](#core-r030) A one-year-old infant presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatobiliary vascular anomalies.[31](#core-r031) Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has also been reported in a nine-year-old girl,[32](#core-r032) and there have been case reports of pulmonary, brain, and urinary tract complications during the first decade of life.The patient under discussion may have had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In the absence of neoplasia, inflammation, or ulceration of the small intestine, the source of the bleeding was probably a vascular lesion. No hemangioma, arteriovenous malformation, or angiodysplasia was apparent, and there were no signs of a connective-tissue disorder or Turner's syndrome. A family history of orocutaneous telangiectasia, recurrent bleeding, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemoptysis might have been revealing, as well as examination of first- and second-degree relatives for evidence of the disease. When the patient had hematuria in infancy, cystoscopy might have detected telangiectasia of the urinary bladder. The patient had no manifestations of biliary disease, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography could have been performed to determine whether the ampulla of Vater or biliary tree was involved.Microscopical examination of the resected jejunal lesion showed no abnormal vessels. However, it may be difficult to diagnose angiodysplasia, an arteriovenous malformation, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia on the basis of histologic studies. If the patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, at least one additional lesion must have continued to bleed postoperatively, either in the area of friable mucosa in the terminal ileum or at another site.If a lesion characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia had been found, what would the therapeutic options have been? Anecdotal reports and prospective studies suggest that treatment with an estrogen–progesterone combination can prevent or decrease bleeding in some cases.[33,34](#core-r033) Aminocaproic acid, a potent inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system, decreased the frequency of bleeding episodes in two patients, perhaps by enabling fibrin to seal the bleeding sites.[35](#core-r035) Those two patients had no abnormalities of platelet aggregation or factor VIII–von Willebrand factor complex, which have been reported in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Desmopressin was effective in one patient with massive gastrointestinal bleeding from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and reduced levels of von Willebrand factor who had not had a response to treatment with cryoprecipitate.[36](#core-r036) In this case, however, if bleeding that required multiple transfusions had continued, intraoperative endoscopy and either ablative therapy or resection would have been necessary. In conclusion, this patient probably had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia involving the small intestine.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Carolyn C. Compton: The diagnostic procedure was a right-sided ileocolectomy. Examination of the specimen showed maroon-to-red mucosal blebs in the cecum and right colon ([Figure 1](#f01)). Microscopical examination of the blebs revealed blood-filled spaces that were part of an extensive plexus of thin-walled ectatic vessels, primarily involving the muscularis mucosae and superficial submucosa. Ectatic vessels traversed the muscularis mucosae, splitting its smooth-muscle fibers ([Figure 2](#f02)). These vessels had ruptured focally, with acute hemorrhage and sloughing of the overlying mucosa. Smaller vessels of identical appearance were also present focally in the muscularis propria.Immunohistochemical stains for factor VIII showed a single layer of endothelium lining the abnormal vessels ([Figure 3](#f03)). Trichrome staining confirmed the absence of smooth muscle in the vessel walls and the paucity of collagen in the perivascular connective tissue, and elastic-tissue staining showed an absence of elastic fibers ([Figure 4](#f04)). No vessels with abnormalities of the muscle layers, such as arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms, were identified. The telangiectatic lesions were characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or Osler–Weber–Rendu disease.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia occurs in all races, with an estimated frequency of 1 case per 2300 persons to 1 per 39,000, depending on the population studied.[22](#core-r022) Although the pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant, 20 percent of the patients do not have a family history of the disorder.[29](#core-r029) Approximately 10 percent of affected persons are asymptomatic and never report bleeding.[37](#core-r037)The vascular dysplasias encompassed by this disease include, in addition to telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, venous varicosities, arteriovenous fistulas, and aneurysms. The relative frequency of these lesions varies among affected families.The pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia has not yet been fully elucidated, but genetic studies have shown that it is a family of disorders caused by mutations in various genes.[22](#core-r022) Thus far, genetic linkages have been established at chromosome 9q33–q34 in some families[38,39](#core-r038) and at chromosome 12q in others.[40,41](#core-r040) A mutation of the gene for endoglin, the most abundant transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)–binding protein on endothelial-cell membranes, has been identified as a specific molecular abnormality in one form of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.[42](#core-r042) Current data suggest that the mutation of this gene, located at chromosome 9q3, results in either reduced production of normal protein or production of a protein that interferes with the normal function of endoglin. Presumably, with the loss of normal endoglin-binding function, endothelial-cell responses to TGF-β, including the migration, proliferation, adhesion, and production or organization of the extracellular matrix, are impaired, leading to vascular dysplasias.Dr. Harland S. Winter: Additional information became available after the diagnostic procedure had been performed. The child's maternal grandfather had epistaxis as a teenager and occasionally as an adult. An otolaryngologist identified telangiectasias in one of the grandfather's ears and in his nose and lower lip when he was 67 years old. Also, a maternal uncle had a history of recurrent nosebleeds, but examination of his nose by an otolaryngologist showed no abnormalities. Two of five maternal aunts had intermittent epistaxis, but neither has been evaluated by an otolaryngologist. None of the patient's first cousins have reported bleeding.Dr. Lewis B. Holmes: Several aspects of this child's story were instructive from the standpoint of a clinical geneticist. When she was hospitalized initially, there was no reported family history of disorders suggesting hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Later, we learned that one grandparent had had nosebleeds. The issue was finally resolved when an otolaryngologist who was familiar with the appearance of nasal telangiectases in this disease examined the potentially affected relatives. This experience underscores the importance of pursuing the family history carefully and consulting knowledgeable examiners. Haitjema et al.[43](#core-r043) have shown that many asymptomatic family members who may carry the gene for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can benefit from careful screening, since it often reveals clinically important, treatable lesions.The importance of the extra effort made to identify affected family members in this case is reminiscent of the experience with tuberous sclerosis, another autosomal dominant disorder in which the diagnosis is typically made first in the most severely affected child in the family. A cursory family history at that time may be negative. In one study,[44](#core-r044) careful screening of the parents of affected children, including examination for subtle skin lesions characteristic of tuberous sclerosis, CT scanning of the brain to detect tubers, and ultrasonography of the kidneys to detect angiomyolipomas, showed that 4 of 26 parents (15 percent) who initially had been considered unaffected had subtle signs of the disease.It is important for clinicians to help geneticists identify extended families in which several members have a genetic disorder and are willing to participate in genetic-linkage studies, which can be important for the family. The family physician can facilitate these studies, which usually require only venipuncture.Dr. Winter: After the diagnosis had been made, radiographic studies of the lungs and brain showed no vascular abnormalities. The patient continued to pass bright red blood rectally and to require blood transfusions. Because we suspected more extensive small-bowel or colonic involvement, we administered aminocaproic acid intravenously and subsequently switched to a dose of 3.75 g orally three times daily. She is currently taking 1.5 g of aminocaproic acid three times daily. Her hematocrit is 39 percent, and she has not had any clinical evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding for nine months.\\n\",\n",

      "Dr. Richard B. Colletti[\\*](#FN1): I shall discuss the common causes of hematochezia, the difficulty of making a diagnosis in cases of bleeding of the small intestine, and the types of vascular lesions that often result in obscure bleeding.Anal fissure, a colonic polyp, and proctitis are common causes of childhood hematochezia, but they are readily detectable and rarely lead to anemia. Juvenile polyps, which typically cause painless hematochezia, can be diagnosed and removed by colonoscopic polypectomy.[1](#core-r001) Anemia accompanied by hematochezia suggests a Meckel's diverticulum, which according to the rule of twos, occurs in 2 percent of births, is 2 inches (5 cm) long and located 2 feet (60 cm) proximal to the ileocecal valve, and is 2 times more common in males than in females.[2](#core-r002) A radionuclide scan with pertechnetate is diagnostic in 95 percent of the cases in which ectopic gastric mucosa is present, and laparotomy confirms the diagnosis in the remainder. Inflammatory bowel disease is a common cause of hematochezia, but the associated abdominal pain and diarrhea were absent in this case.[3](#core-r003) Other indicators of inflammatory bowel disease, which were also absent, are radiographic evidence of mural thickening, a stricture, or a fistula of the small intestine; endoscopic evidence of mucosal granularity, ulceration, hemorrhage, or exudate; and a biopsy finding of disruption of the glandular architecture, infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes, or granulomas. The results of CT scanning and laparotomy rule out a bowel duplication as the cause of bleeding in this case.[4](#core-r004)The presence of hematochezia without hematemesis or blood in the gastric aspirate does not suggest a source of bleeding above the ligament of Treitz, although rapid, profuse, intermittent bleeding could have originated at any site distal to the pylorus. Esophageal varices and peptic ulcer disease caused by either *Helicobacter pylori* or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs would have been seen during endoscopy.[5](#core-r005) The clinical course is also inconsistent with intussusception, which typically causes severe colicky abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant in older children, without profuse bleeding. Schönlein–Henoch purpura, characterized by a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but skin lesions are generally present either at the onset of the illness or within six weeks thereafter, and purpura of the bowel may be detected by endoscopy.[6](#core-r006) There is also no evidence of either the hemolytic–uremic syndrome, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, uremia, and hemorrhagic colitis, or the Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which a factitious illness is reported or simulated by a parent.Bleeding from the biliary tree, which is rare in children, can be caused by trauma, a neoplasm, a gallstone, a hepatic aneurysm, an abscess, or a vascular lesion. Bleeding from the pancreas is even more rare. Hematobilia, however, typically causes upper gastrointestinal bleeding, often with biliary colic or jaundice, and hepatobiliary lesions are generally detectable by CT scanning or angiographic examination.Congenital hemangiomas of the bowel, either isolated or in the form of diffuse hemangiomatosis, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, usually in the first decade of life. Cutaneous lesions are often absent. Bowel hemangiomas may be very difficult to detect by endoscopic, radiographic, or CT examination but are generally seen at laparotomy. Patients with the Klippel–Trénaunay–Weber syndrome, which is characterized by cutaneous hemangiomas and limb hypertrophy, occasionally have bleeding from bowel lesions, particularly in the rectum. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, characterized by bluish cutaneous and gastrointestinal cavernous hemangiomas, is another rare but endoscopically detectable cause of bleeding.[7](#core-r007)Adolescents may have disorders that are more common in adults than in children, such as a hemorrhoid, a neoplasm, a diverticulum, or angiodysplasia. Hemorrhoidal thrombosis causes pain as well as bleeding but rarely causes anemia and is detectable on physical examination or by anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Neoplasms cause chronic occult bleeding more often than they cause hematochezia. In adults, diverticulosis and vascular ectasias account for more than 60 percent of major lower intestinal hemorrhages. Abrupt, painless, severe bleeding from diverticulosis originates most often in a large artery in the proximal colon and is detected by colonoscopy or angiography.[8](#core-r008)Other, less frequent causes of bleeding include a solitary rectal ulcer, colonic varices, mesenteric vascular insufficiency, and an aortoenteric fistula. Endometriosis of the bowel wall, particularly the rectum or distal ileum, can cause cyclic lower intestinal bleeding in reproductive-age females and is difficult to diagnose.[8](#core-r008) None of these disorders were apparent in this case, however, and the bleeding was not related to menses.The endoscopic and operative findings in this patient strongly suggest bleeding from the small intestine, the region of the bowel that is most difficult to study. Lesions in the small intestine often bleed slowly or intermittently, and its length, intraperitoneal location, vigorous contractility, and overlying loops hinder early diagnosis.[9](#core-r009) Contrast radiography of the small bowel, even with enteroclysis, detects obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in only 5 to 10 percent of cases. Radionuclide scanning of technetium-labeled red cells can be used to locate blood within the small bowel. Identifying the precise location of bleeding is difficult, however, and misleading information may result from the detection of pooled blood distal to the source of bleeding.[9,10](#core-r009)Angiography can detect bleeding at a rate as low as 0.5 ml per minute and can demonstrate massively bleeding lesions in the small and large bowel in over half the cases. When a bleeding lesion is identified, intraoperative injection of methylene-blue dye in a precisely positioned angiographic catheter can enable the surgeon to locate the source of hemorrhage and resect the shortest possible segment of small intestine.[11](#core-r011) A surgical exploration with palpation and transillumination of the small bowel but without other intraoperative techniques detects obscure causes of gastrointestinal bleeding, usually large vascular abnormalities or submucosal tumors, in only 10 percent of cases.[9,12](#core-r009)It is difficult to examine the small intestine endoscopically. A colonoscope can be used for upper endoscopic examination and advanced 40 to 60 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz by a technique called push enteroscopy. Specially designed enteroscopes can be pushed 80 to 120 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz. With sonde enteroscopy, the instrument has a balloon at the tip. When the balloon is propelled by peristalsis, it slowly traverses most of the small intestine, which can be viewed as the instrument is withdrawn.[13,14](#core-r013) Enteroscopy can identify obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in nearly 40 percent of cases. Intraoperative enteroscopy, in which a colonoscope is advanced to the proximal jejunum, where the surgeon aligns short segments of small bowel for visualization until the ileocecal valve is reached, is the most effective technique for endoscopic examination, with more than 80 percent of small-bowel lesions identified in this manner.[15,16](#core-r015) Potential complications include mucosal lacerations, perforation, and prolonged ileus. Rebleeding occurs in up to 45 percent of cases.The small intestine between the ligament of Treitz and the ileocecal valve is involved in only 3 to 5 percent of cases of major gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. Angiodysplasia accounts for 70 to 80 percent of cases of bleeding of the small intestine in adults; tumors, primarily leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas, account for 5 to 10 percent; and other vascular lesions account for less than 5 percent.[9](#core-r009)Angiodysplasia, characterized by a cluster of vessels, is found predominantly in the cecum and ascending colon in patients over the age of 60 years. The disorder is associated with aging, although it has been reported in young adults. In the early stages, the lesion consists of ectatic, distorted, thin-walled veins, venules, and capillaries in the submucosa, and it can progress to involve the mucosa. Enlarged arteries and thick-walled veins are seen in the advanced stage, which is less common. Routine histopathological examination detects fewer than a third of these lesions; special techniques, including the injection of colonic vessels with silicon rubber, are necessary to detect the remainder.[17](#core-r017)Angiodysplasia may also be difficult to detect by endoscopy, since other lesions, such as telangiectasia, colitis, and artifacts created by trauma or suction, may simulate it. Endoscopic visualization of angiodysplasia and other vascular lesions may be impaired by hypovolemia, which can be caused by bleeding or by the administration of meperidine during endoscopy. Angiographic examination can identify actively bleeding lesions, as well as some lesions that have stopped bleeding. Although angiographic examination often reveals colonic angiodysplasia, it rarely detects small-bowel angiodysplasia, which is diagnosed by either enteroscopy or intraoperative endoscopy.[9,18](#core-r009)In addition to hemangiomas, vascular lesions of the small intestine include arteriovenous malformations, connective-tissue disorders, and telangiectasia. Arteriovenous malformations, which contain thick-walled arteries and veins without capillaries, are congenital and occur in the young. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by degeneration of elastic fibers of the skin, eyes, and arteries, with thickening of the skin, angioid retinal streaks, and vascular occlusion. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur in children as young as five years of age, as a result of the rupture of dilated mucosal and submucosal veins and capillaries as well as arteries.[7,19](#core-r007) The Ehlers–Danlos syndrome can result in spontaneous arterial and intestinal rupture due to a defect in collagen synthesis, as well as hyperelasticity of the skin and joints and mitral-valve prolapse.[20](#core-r020)Telangiectasia (localized dilatation of capillaries and venules) in the small intestine can be associated with Turner's syndrome and can be a component of the CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In Turner's syndrome, telangiectasia has a predilection for the small bowel. Bleeding is uncommon, usually intermittent, and self-limited, but it can be severe and persistent.[21](#core-r021) Lesions may be detected by endoscopic examination but are found more often at laparotomy. The diagnosis is based on a 45,X karyotype and phenotypic features that include short stature, transient congenital lymphedema, widely spaced nipples, a webbed neck, cubitus valgus, and gonadal dysgenesis. Features of both the CREST syndrome and Turner's syndrome were absent in this child.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia comprises a group of autosomal dominant disorders of blood vessels of the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, and brain.[22](#core-r022) Early lesions are characterized by focal dilatations of postcapillary venules. When the disorder is fully developed, the venules are markedly dilated and convoluted, have no elastic fibers, and often communicate directly with dilated arterioles; true arteriovenous malformations are infrequent. The earliest sign of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is usually epistaxis, which is present in about half the patients by the age of 20 years; cutaneous telangiectasia is detectable in about half the patients by the age of 30 years. Approximately a quarter of the patients have visceral involvement, and in about 10 percent of those with visceral involvement, it precedes other manifestations.[23,24](#core-r023) Lesions may be found in the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, or colon, usually beginning in the fifth or sixth decade of life.[25](#core-r025) Bleeding may be severe, requiring many transfusions. Hepatic arteriovenous malformations can result in high-output cardiac failure.[26](#core-r026) In rare cases, a lesion of the ampulla of Vater causes bleeding.[27](#core-r027) In one series, 15 percent of the patients had gastrointestinal manifestations, beginning between the ages of 8 and 87 years, but less than 2 percent had such manifestations before the age of 30 years. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the initial manifestation in 1 percent of the patients. Recurrent bleeding was common and was fatal in some cases.[23](#core-r023)The typical endoscopic finding in patients with gastrointestinal hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is multiple, small, red, well-defined, flat nodules, often with stellate projections and an “anemic halo.” The lesions may resemble those of erosive gastritis or iatrogenic lesions of the mucosa. In a minority of the reported cases, there is no visible external lesion or family history of the disorder.[25,28](#core-r025)Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia rarely presents in childhood. It has been reported in a 10-month-old infant with gastric involvement and hematemesis.[29](#core-r029) In four children between one and five years of age, bleeding from colonic telangiectasia preceded the development of skin lesions or epistaxis.[30](#core-r030) A one-year-old infant presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatobiliary vascular anomalies.[31](#core-r031) Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has also been reported in a nine-year-old girl,[32](#core-r032) and there have been case reports of pulmonary, brain, and urinary tract complications during the first decade of life.The patient under discussion may have had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In the absence of neoplasia, inflammation, or ulceration of the small intestine, the source of the bleeding was probably a vascular lesion. No hemangioma, arteriovenous malformation, or angiodysplasia was apparent, and there were no signs of a connective-tissue disorder or Turner's syndrome. A family history of orocutaneous telangiectasia, recurrent bleeding, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemoptysis might have been revealing, as well as examination of first- and second-degree relatives for evidence of the disease. When the patient had hematuria in infancy, cystoscopy might have detected telangiectasia of the urinary bladder. The patient had no manifestations of biliary disease, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography could have been performed to determine whether the ampulla of Vater or biliary tree was involved.Microscopical examination of the resected jejunal lesion showed no abnormal vessels. However, it may be difficult to diagnose angiodysplasia, an arteriovenous malformation, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia on the basis of histologic studies. If the patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, at least one additional lesion must have continued to bleed postoperatively, either in the area of friable mucosa in the terminal ileum or at another site.If a lesion characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia had been found, what would the therapeutic options have been? Anecdotal reports and prospective studies suggest that treatment with an estrogen–progesterone combination can prevent or decrease bleeding in some cases.[33,34](#core-r033) Aminocaproic acid, a potent inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system, decreased the frequency of bleeding episodes in two patients, perhaps by enabling fibrin to seal the bleeding sites.[35](#core-r035) Those two patients had no abnormalities of platelet aggregation or factor VIII–von Willebrand factor complex, which have been reported in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Desmopressin was effective in one patient with massive gastrointestinal bleeding from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and reduced levels of von Willebrand factor who had not had a response to treatment with cryoprecipitate.[36](#core-r036) In this case, however, if bleeding that required multiple transfusions had continued, intraoperative endoscopy and either ablative therapy or resection would have been necessary. In conclusion, this patient probably had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia involving the small intestine.\n",

      "Dr. Carolyn C. Compton: The diagnostic procedure was a right-sided ileocolectomy. Examination of the specimen showed maroon-to-red mucosal blebs in the cecum and right colon ([Figure 1](#f01)). Microscopical examination of the blebs revealed blood-filled spaces that were part of an extensive plexus of thin-walled ectatic vessels, primarily involving the muscularis mucosae and superficial submucosa. Ectatic vessels traversed the muscularis mucosae, splitting its smooth-muscle fibers ([Figure 2](#f02)). These vessels had ruptured focally, with acute hemorrhage and sloughing of the overlying mucosa. Smaller vessels of identical appearance were also present focally in the muscularis propria.Immunohistochemical stains for factor VIII showed a single layer of endothelium lining the abnormal vessels ([Figure 3](#f03)). Trichrome staining confirmed the absence of smooth muscle in the vessel walls and the paucity of collagen in the perivascular connective tissue, and elastic-tissue staining showed an absence of elastic fibers ([Figure 4](#f04)). No vessels with abnormalities of the muscle layers, such as arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms, were identified. The telangiectatic lesions were characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or Osler–Weber–Rendu disease.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia occurs in all races, with an estimated frequency of 1 case per 2300 persons to 1 per 39,000, depending on the population studied.[22](#core-r022) Although the pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant, 20 percent of the patients do not have a family history of the disorder.[29](#core-r029) Approximately 10 percent of affected persons are asymptomatic and never report bleeding.[37](#core-r037)The vascular dysplasias encompassed by this disease include, in addition to telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, venous varicosities, arteriovenous fistulas, and aneurysms. The relative frequency of these lesions varies among affected families.The pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia has not yet been fully elucidated, but genetic studies have shown that it is a family of disorders caused by mutations in various genes.[22](#core-r022) Thus far, genetic linkages have been established at chromosome 9q33–q34 in some families[38,39](#core-r038) and at chromosome 12q in others.[40,41](#core-r040) A mutation of the gene for endoglin, the most abundant transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)–binding protein on endothelial-cell membranes, has been identified as a specific molecular abnormality in one form of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.[42](#core-r042) Current data suggest that the mutation of this gene, located at chromosome 9q3, results in either reduced production of normal protein or production of a protein that interferes with the normal function of endoglin. Presumably, with the loss of normal endoglin-binding function, endothelial-cell responses to TGF-β, including the migration, proliferation, adhesion, and production or organization of the extracellular matrix, are impaired, leading to vascular dysplasias.Dr. Harland S. Winter: Additional information became available after the diagnostic procedure had been performed. The child's maternal grandfather had epistaxis as a teenager and occasionally as an adult. An otolaryngologist identified telangiectasias in one of the grandfather's ears and in his nose and lower lip when he was 67 years old. Also, a maternal uncle had a history of recurrent nosebleeds, but examination of his nose by an otolaryngologist showed no abnormalities. Two of five maternal aunts had intermittent epistaxis, but neither has been evaluated by an otolaryngologist. None of the patient's first cousins have reported bleeding.Dr. Lewis B. Holmes: Several aspects of this child's story were instructive from the standpoint of a clinical geneticist. When she was hospitalized initially, there was no reported family history of disorders suggesting hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Later, we learned that one grandparent had had nosebleeds. The issue was finally resolved when an otolaryngologist who was familiar with the appearance of nasal telangiectases in this disease examined the potentially affected relatives. This experience underscores the importance of pursuing the family history carefully and consulting knowledgeable examiners. Haitjema et al.[43](#core-r043) have shown that many asymptomatic family members who may carry the gene for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can benefit from careful screening, since it often reveals clinically important, treatable lesions.The importance of the extra effort made to identify affected family members in this case is reminiscent of the experience with tuberous sclerosis, another autosomal dominant disorder in which the diagnosis is typically made first in the most severely affected child in the family. A cursory family history at that time may be negative. In one study,[44](#core-r044) careful screening of the parents of affected children, including examination for subtle skin lesions characteristic of tuberous sclerosis, CT scanning of the brain to detect tubers, and ultrasonography of the kidneys to detect angiomyolipomas, showed that 4 of 26 parents (15 percent) who initially had been considered unaffected had subtle signs of the disease.It is important for clinicians to help geneticists identify extended families in which several members have a genetic disorder and are willing to participate in genetic-linkage studies, which can be important for the family. The family physician can facilitate these studies, which usually require only venipuncture.Dr. Winter: After the diagnosis had been made, radiographic studies of the lungs and brain showed no vascular abnormalities. The patient continued to pass bright red blood rectally and to require blood transfusions. Because we suspected more extensive small-bowel or colonic involvement, we administered aminocaproic acid intravenously and subsequently switched to a dose of 3.75 g orally three times daily. She is currently taking 1.5 g of aminocaproic acid three times daily. Her hematocrit is 39 percent, and she has not had any clinical evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding for nine months.\n",

      "In adolescents, we need to consider hemorrhoids, neoplasms, diverticula, and angiodysplasia. Hemorrhoids are usually painful and detectable on examination. Neoplasms usually cause occult bleeding. Diverticulosis and vascular ectasias are more common in adults.\n",

       "{'original': {'Question': \"A 14-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of recurrent rectal bleeding.\\nShe had been in excellent health until three years earlier, when she began to pass blood-tinged stools. The bleeding increased during the course of several days. A proctosigmoidoscopic examination showed no abnormality. Hydrocortisone enemas were followed by the cessation of bleeding. She was then well until 45 days before admission, when her stools again became blood-tinged, and she later passed frank blood rectally. A colonoscopic examination did not reveal the source of the bleeding. Hematochezia continued. Twenty-seven days before admission, the results of an esophagogastroduodenoscopic examination at another hospital were normal. A colonoscopic examination showed blood in the rectum and ascending colon, but the source was not identified. A radionuclide scan for Meckel's diverticulum was normal.\\nOne day later, the patient was transferred to this hospital. A physical examination was normal. Another radionuclide scan for Meckel's diverticulum and an upper gastrointestinal series with a small-bowel follow-through study were normal. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal on two occasions; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\\nTable 1\\n. The rectal bleeding diminished spontaneously, and the patient was discharged on the third hospital day with instructions to take ferrous sulfate. That evening, the rectal bleeding increased, and for several days she passed fresh blood rectally. She returned to this hospital 21 days before the current admission.\\nA physical examination was again normal, except for pallor. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal on two occasions; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\\nTable 1\\n. On the second hospital day, an exploratory laparotomy revealed evidence of blood in the small bowel and in the ascending, transverse, and descending colon. A Meckel's diverticulum was not detected. A hemorrhagic area, 1 cm by 1 cm, on the antimesenteric aspect of the midportion of the jejunum was excised. An intraoperative endoscopic examination, performed by telescoping the small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve over a sterile colonoscope, revealed a friable area of mucosa in the terminal ileum. Biopsy specimens were obtained. The liver appeared normal. An incidental appendectomy was performed. After the surgery, the patient passed stools with small blood clots. She was discharged on the ninth hospital day. Microscopical examination of the biopsy specimens obtained from the hemorrhagic area of the jejunum revealed acute submucosal hemorrhage without vascular abnormalities; the appendix and the biopsy specimens obtained from the terminal ileum were normal.\\nFour days after discharge, rectal bleeding recurred and worsened progressively. One day before admission, the hematocrit was 15 percent. Three units of packed red cells were transfused. Another colonoscopic examination was normal. On the following day, the patient was readmitted to the hospital.\\nShe had had hematuria during infancy, but an evaluation had not revealed the source of the bleeding. The episodes of bleeding had not been accompanied by pain or abdominal cramps, and there was no history of fever, diarrhea, constipation, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, easy bruising, orthostatic faintness, or syncope. Two younger siblings were well.\\nThe temperature was 37°C, the pulse was 108, and the respirations were 14. The blood pressure was 110/55 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was pale but appeared well nourished and appropriately developed for her age. No oral or cutaneous lesions were seen. The head, neck, lungs, and heart were normal, as were the abdomen and arms and legs.\\nPlatelet-aggregation studies were normal. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times and the values for urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolytes were normal; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\\nTable 1\\n. A mesenteric angiographic examination showed no evidence of an arteriovenous malformation or active extravasation of contrast material. There was normal hepatic branching from the celiac axis, and the splenic and portal veins were patent. A radionuclide scan for bleeding revealed normal activity in the liver, spleen, and great vessels, without evidence of hemorrhage, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was normal.\\nHematochezia persisted, and the hematocrit fell from 27.1 to 19.3 percent. Two additional units of packed red cells were transfused.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?\",\n",
       "  'Complex_CoT': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richard B. Colletti[\\\\*](#FN1): I shall discuss the common causes of hematochezia, the difficulty of making a diagnosis in cases of bleeding of the small intestine, and the types of vascular lesions that often result in obscure bleeding.Anal fissure, a colonic polyp, and proctitis are common causes of childhood hematochezia, but they are readily detectable and rarely lead to anemia. Juvenile polyps, which typically cause painless hematochezia, can be diagnosed and removed by colonoscopic polypectomy.[1](#core-r001) Anemia accompanied by hematochezia suggests a Meckel's diverticulum, which according to the rule of twos, occurs in 2 percent of births, is 2 inches (5 cm) long and located 2 feet (60 cm) proximal to the ileocecal valve, and is 2 times more common in males than in females.[2](#core-r002) A radionuclide scan with pertechnetate is diagnostic in 95 percent of the cases in which ectopic gastric mucosa is present, and laparotomy confirms the diagnosis in the remainder. Inflammatory bowel disease is a common cause of hematochezia, but the associated abdominal pain and diarrhea were absent in this case.[3](#core-r003) Other indicators of inflammatory bowel disease, which were also absent, are radiographic evidence of mural thickening, a stricture, or a fistula of the small intestine; endoscopic evidence of mucosal granularity, ulceration, hemorrhage, or exudate; and a biopsy finding of disruption of the glandular architecture, infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes, or granulomas. The results of CT scanning and laparotomy rule out a bowel duplication as the cause of bleeding in this case.[4](#core-r004)The presence of hematochezia without hematemesis or blood in the gastric aspirate does not suggest a source of bleeding above the ligament of Treitz, although rapid, profuse, intermittent bleeding could have originated at any site distal to the pylorus. Esophageal varices and peptic ulcer disease caused by either *Helicobacter pylori* or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs would have been seen during endoscopy.[5](#core-r005) The clinical course is also inconsistent with intussusception, which typically causes severe colicky abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant in older children, without profuse bleeding. Schönlein–Henoch purpura, characterized by a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but skin lesions are generally present either at the onset of the illness or within six weeks thereafter, and purpura of the bowel may be detected by endoscopy.[6](#core-r006) There is also no evidence of either the hemolytic–uremic syndrome, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, uremia, and hemorrhagic colitis, or the Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which a factitious illness is reported or simulated by a parent.Bleeding from the biliary tree, which is rare in children, can be caused by trauma, a neoplasm, a gallstone, a hepatic aneurysm, an abscess, or a vascular lesion. Bleeding from the pancreas is even more rare. Hematobilia, however, typically causes upper gastrointestinal bleeding, often with biliary colic or jaundice, and hepatobiliary lesions are generally detectable by CT scanning or angiographic examination.Congenital hemangiomas of the bowel, either isolated or in the form of diffuse hemangiomatosis, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, usually in the first decade of life. Cutaneous lesions are often absent. Bowel hemangiomas may be very difficult to detect by endoscopic, radiographic, or CT examination but are generally seen at laparotomy. Patients with the Klippel–Trénaunay–Weber syndrome, which is characterized by cutaneous hemangiomas and limb hypertrophy, occasionally have bleeding from bowel lesions, particularly in the rectum. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, characterized by bluish cutaneous and gastrointestinal cavernous hemangiomas, is another rare but endoscopically detectable cause of bleeding.[7](#core-r007)Adolescents may have disorders that are more common in adults than in children, such as a hemorrhoid, a neoplasm, a diverticulum, or angiodysplasia. Hemorrhoidal thrombosis causes pain as well as bleeding but rarely causes anemia and is detectable on physical examination or by anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Neoplasms cause chronic occult bleeding more often than they cause hematochezia. In adults, diverticulosis and vascular ectasias account for more than 60 percent of major lower intestinal hemorrhages. Abrupt, painless, severe bleeding from diverticulosis originates most often in a large artery in the proximal colon and is detected by colonoscopy or angiography.[8](#core-r008)Other, less frequent causes of bleeding include a solitary rectal ulcer, colonic varices, mesenteric vascular insufficiency, and an aortoenteric fistula. Endometriosis of the bowel wall, particularly the rectum or distal ileum, can cause cyclic lower intestinal bleeding in reproductive-age females and is difficult to diagnose.[8](#core-r008) None of these disorders were apparent in this case, however, and the bleeding was not related to menses.The endoscopic and operative findings in this patient strongly suggest bleeding from the small intestine, the region of the bowel that is most difficult to study. Lesions in the small intestine often bleed slowly or intermittently, and its length, intraperitoneal location, vigorous contractility, and overlying loops hinder early diagnosis.[9](#core-r009) Contrast radiography of the small bowel, even with enteroclysis, detects obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in only 5 to 10 percent of cases. Radionuclide scanning of technetium-labeled red cells can be used to locate blood within the small bowel. Identifying the precise location of bleeding is difficult, however, and misleading information may result from the detection of pooled blood distal to the source of bleeding.[9,10](#core-r009)Angiography can detect bleeding at a rate as low as 0.5 ml per minute and can demonstrate massively bleeding lesions in the small and large bowel in over half the cases. When a bleeding lesion is identified, intraoperative injection of methylene-blue dye in a precisely positioned angiographic catheter can enable the surgeon to locate the source of hemorrhage and resect the shortest possible segment of small intestine.[11](#core-r011) A surgical exploration with palpation and transillumination of the small bowel but without other intraoperative techniques detects obscure causes of gastrointestinal bleeding, usually large vascular abnormalities or submucosal tumors, in only 10 percent of cases.[9,12](#core-r009)It is difficult to examine the small intestine endoscopically. A colonoscope can be used for upper endoscopic examination and advanced 40 to 60 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz by a technique called push enteroscopy. Specially designed enteroscopes can be pushed 80 to 120 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz. With sonde enteroscopy, the instrument has a balloon at the tip. When the balloon is propelled by peristalsis, it slowly traverses most of the small intestine, which can be viewed as the instrument is withdrawn.[13,14](#core-r013) Enteroscopy can identify obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in nearly 40 percent of cases. Intraoperative enteroscopy, in which a colonoscope is advanced to the proximal jejunum, where the surgeon aligns short segments of small bowel for visualization until the ileocecal valve is reached, is the most effective technique for endoscopic examination, with more than 80 percent of small-bowel lesions identified in this manner.[15,16](#core-r015) Potential complications include mucosal lacerations, perforation, and prolonged ileus. Rebleeding occurs in up to 45 percent of cases.The small intestine between the ligament of Treitz and the ileocecal valve is involved in only 3 to 5 percent of cases of major gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. Angiodysplasia accounts for 70 to 80 percent of cases of bleeding of the small intestine in adults; tumors, primarily leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas, account for 5 to 10 percent; and other vascular lesions account for less than 5 percent.[9](#core-r009)Angiodysplasia, characterized by a cluster of vessels, is found predominantly in the cecum and ascending colon in patients over the age of 60 years. The disorder is associated with aging, although it has been reported in young adults. In the early stages, the lesion consists of ectatic, distorted, thin-walled veins, venules, and capillaries in the submucosa, and it can progress to involve the mucosa. Enlarged arteries and thick-walled veins are seen in the advanced stage, which is less common. Routine histopathological examination detects fewer than a third of these lesions; special techniques, including the injection of colonic vessels with silicon rubber, are necessary to detect the remainder.[17](#core-r017)Angiodysplasia may also be difficult to detect by endoscopy, since other lesions, such as telangiectasia, colitis, and artifacts created by trauma or suction, may simulate it. Endoscopic visualization of angiodysplasia and other vascular lesions may be impaired by hypovolemia, which can be caused by bleeding or by the administration of meperidine during endoscopy. Angiographic examination can identify actively bleeding lesions, as well as some lesions that have stopped bleeding. Although angiographic examination often reveals colonic angiodysplasia, it rarely detects small-bowel angiodysplasia, which is diagnosed by either enteroscopy or intraoperative endoscopy.[9,18](#core-r009)In addition to hemangiomas, vascular lesions of the small intestine include arteriovenous malformations, connective-tissue disorders, and telangiectasia. Arteriovenous malformations, which contain thick-walled arteries and veins without capillaries, are congenital and occur in the young. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by degeneration of elastic fibers of the skin, eyes, and arteries, with thickening of the skin, angioid retinal streaks, and vascular occlusion. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur in children as young as five years of age, as a result of the rupture of dilated mucosal and submucosal veins and capillaries as well as arteries.[7,19](#core-r007) The Ehlers–Danlos syndrome can result in spontaneous arterial and intestinal rupture due to a defect in collagen synthesis, as well as hyperelasticity of the skin and joints and mitral-valve prolapse.[20](#core-r020)Telangiectasia (localized dilatation of capillaries and venules) in the small intestine can be associated with Turner's syndrome and can be a component of the CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In Turner's syndrome, telangiectasia has a predilection for the small bowel. Bleeding is uncommon, usually intermittent, and self-limited, but it can be severe and persistent.[21](#core-r021) Lesions may be detected by endoscopic examination but are found more often at laparotomy. The diagnosis is based on a 45,X karyotype and phenotypic features that include short stature, transient congenital lymphedema, widely spaced nipples, a webbed neck, cubitus valgus, and gonadal dysgenesis. Features of both the CREST syndrome and Turner's syndrome were absent in this child.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia comprises a group of autosomal dominant disorders of blood vessels of the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, and brain.[22](#core-r022) Early lesions are characterized by focal dilatations of postcapillary venules. When the disorder is fully developed, the venules are markedly dilated and convoluted, have no elastic fibers, and often communicate directly with dilated arterioles; true arteriovenous malformations are infrequent. The earliest sign of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is usually epistaxis, which is present in about half the patients by the age of 20 years; cutaneous telangiectasia is detectable in about half the patients by the age of 30 years. Approximately a quarter of the patients have visceral involvement, and in about 10 percent of those with visceral involvement, it precedes other manifestations.[23,24](#core-r023) Lesions may be found in the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, or colon, usually beginning in the fifth or sixth decade of life.[25](#core-r025) Bleeding may be severe, requiring many transfusions. Hepatic arteriovenous malformations can result in high-output cardiac failure.[26](#core-r026) In rare cases, a lesion of the ampulla of Vater causes bleeding.[27](#core-r027) In one series, 15 percent of the patients had gastrointestinal manifestations, beginning between the ages of 8 and 87 years, but less than 2 percent had such manifestations before the age of 30 years. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the initial manifestation in 1 percent of the patients. Recurrent bleeding was common and was fatal in some cases.[23](#core-r023)The typical endoscopic finding in patients with gastrointestinal hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is multiple, small, red, well-defined, flat nodules, often with stellate projections and an “anemic halo.” The lesions may resemble those of erosive gastritis or iatrogenic lesions of the mucosa. In a minority of the reported cases, there is no visible external lesion or family history of the disorder.[25,28](#core-r025)Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia rarely presents in childhood. It has been reported in a 10-month-old infant with gastric involvement and hematemesis.[29](#core-r029) In four children between one and five years of age, bleeding from colonic telangiectasia preceded the development of skin lesions or epistaxis.[30](#core-r030) A one-year-old infant presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatobiliary vascular anomalies.[31](#core-r031) Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has also been reported in a nine-year-old girl,[32](#core-r032) and there have been case reports of pulmonary, brain, and urinary tract complications during the first decade of life.The patient under discussion may have had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In the absence of neoplasia, inflammation, or ulceration of the small intestine, the source of the bleeding was probably a vascular lesion. No hemangioma, arteriovenous malformation, or angiodysplasia was apparent, and there were no signs of a connective-tissue disorder or Turner's syndrome. A family history of orocutaneous telangiectasia, recurrent bleeding, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemoptysis might have been revealing, as well as examination of first- and second-degree relatives for evidence of the disease. When the patient had hematuria in infancy, cystoscopy might have detected telangiectasia of the urinary bladder. The patient had no manifestations of biliary disease, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography could have been performed to determine whether the ampulla of Vater or biliary tree was involved.Microscopical examination of the resected jejunal lesion showed no abnormal vessels. However, it may be difficult to diagnose angiodysplasia, an arteriovenous malformation, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia on the basis of histologic studies. If the patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, at least one additional lesion must have continued to bleed postoperatively, either in the area of friable mucosa in the terminal ileum or at another site.If a lesion characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia had been found, what would the therapeutic options have been? Anecdotal reports and prospective studies suggest that treatment with an estrogen–progesterone combination can prevent or decrease bleeding in some cases.[33,34](#core-r033) Aminocaproic acid, a potent inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system, decreased the frequency of bleeding episodes in two patients, perhaps by enabling fibrin to seal the bleeding sites.[35](#core-r035) Those two patients had no abnormalities of platelet aggregation or factor VIII–von Willebrand factor complex, which have been reported in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Desmopressin was effective in one patient with massive gastrointestinal bleeding from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and reduced levels of von Willebrand factor who had not had a response to treatment with cryoprecipitate.[36](#core-r036) In this case, however, if bleeding that required multiple transfusions had continued, intraoperative endoscopy and either ablative therapy or resection would have been necessary. In conclusion, this patient probably had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia involving the small intestine.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Carolyn C. Compton: The diagnostic procedure was a right-sided ileocolectomy. Examination of the specimen showed maroon-to-red mucosal blebs in the cecum and right colon ([Figure 1](#f01)). Microscopical examination of the blebs revealed blood-filled spaces that were part of an extensive plexus of thin-walled ectatic vessels, primarily involving the muscularis mucosae and superficial submucosa. Ectatic vessels traversed the muscularis mucosae, splitting its smooth-muscle fibers ([Figure 2](#f02)). These vessels had ruptured focally, with acute hemorrhage and sloughing of the overlying mucosa. Smaller vessels of identical appearance were also present focally in the muscularis propria.Immunohistochemical stains for factor VIII showed a single layer of endothelium lining the abnormal vessels ([Figure 3](#f03)). Trichrome staining confirmed the absence of smooth muscle in the vessel walls and the paucity of collagen in the perivascular connective tissue, and elastic-tissue staining showed an absence of elastic fibers ([Figure 4](#f04)). No vessels with abnormalities of the muscle layers, such as arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms, were identified. The telangiectatic lesions were characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or Osler–Weber–Rendu disease.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia occurs in all races, with an estimated frequency of 1 case per 2300 persons to 1 per 39,000, depending on the population studied.[22](#core-r022) Although the pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant, 20 percent of the patients do not have a family history of the disorder.[29](#core-r029) Approximately 10 percent of affected persons are asymptomatic and never report bleeding.[37](#core-r037)The vascular dysplasias encompassed by this disease include, in addition to telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, venous varicosities, arteriovenous fistulas, and aneurysms. The relative frequency of these lesions varies among affected families.The pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia has not yet been fully elucidated, but genetic studies have shown that it is a family of disorders caused by mutations in various genes.[22](#core-r022) Thus far, genetic linkages have been established at chromosome 9q33–q34 in some families[38,39](#core-r038) and at chromosome 12q in others.[40,41](#core-r040) A mutation of the gene for endoglin, the most abundant transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)–binding protein on endothelial-cell membranes, has been identified as a specific molecular abnormality in one form of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.[42](#core-r042) Current data suggest that the mutation of this gene, located at chromosome 9q3, results in either reduced production of normal protein or production of a protein that interferes with the normal function of endoglin. Presumably, with the loss of normal endoglin-binding function, endothelial-cell responses to TGF-β, including the migration, proliferation, adhesion, and production or organization of the extracellular matrix, are impaired, leading to vascular dysplasias.Dr. Harland S. Winter: Additional information became available after the diagnostic procedure had been performed. The child's maternal grandfather had epistaxis as a teenager and occasionally as an adult. An otolaryngologist identified telangiectasias in one of the grandfather's ears and in his nose and lower lip when he was 67 years old. Also, a maternal uncle had a history of recurrent nosebleeds, but examination of his nose by an otolaryngologist showed no abnormalities. Two of five maternal aunts had intermittent epistaxis, but neither has been evaluated by an otolaryngologist. None of the patient's first cousins have reported bleeding.Dr. Lewis B. Holmes: Several aspects of this child's story were instructive from the standpoint of a clinical geneticist. When she was hospitalized initially, there was no reported family history of disorders suggesting hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Later, we learned that one grandparent had had nosebleeds. The issue was finally resolved when an otolaryngologist who was familiar with the appearance of nasal telangiectases in this disease examined the potentially affected relatives. This experience underscores the importance of pursuing the family history carefully and consulting knowledgeable examiners. Haitjema et al.[43](#core-r043) have shown that many asymptomatic family members who may carry the gene for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can benefit from careful screening, since it often reveals clinically important, treatable lesions.The importance of the extra effort made to identify affected family members in this case is reminiscent of the experience with tuberous sclerosis, another autosomal dominant disorder in which the diagnosis is typically made first in the most severely affected child in the family. A cursory family history at that time may be negative. In one study,[44](#core-r044) careful screening of the parents of affected children, including examination for subtle skin lesions characteristic of tuberous sclerosis, CT scanning of the brain to detect tubers, and ultrasonography of the kidneys to detect angiomyolipomas, showed that 4 of 26 parents (15 percent) who initially had been considered unaffected had subtle signs of the disease.It is important for clinicians to help geneticists identify extended families in which several members have a genetic disorder and are willing to participate in genetic-linkage studies, which can be important for the family. The family physician can facilitate these studies, which usually require only venipuncture.Dr. Winter: After the diagnosis had been made, radiographic studies of the lungs and brain showed no vascular abnormalities. The patient continued to pass bright red blood rectally and to require blood transfusions. Because we suspected more extensive small-bowel or colonic involvement, we administered aminocaproic acid intravenously and subsequently switched to a dose of 3.75 g orally three times daily. She is currently taking 1.5 g of aminocaproic acid three times daily. Her hematocrit is 39 percent, and she has not had any clinical evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding for nine months.\\n\",\n",

      "Question: A 37-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of headaches and memory loss.\n",
      "She was well until seven months earlier, when she began to experience nausea and vomiting. Two days later a brief syncopal episode occurred, and a few days thereafter she became transiently disoriented, anxious, and agitated. She did not recognize her friends. She was taken to a local hospital, where examination showed that the blood pressure was 170 mm Hg systolic; no other abnormality was found. A tranquilizer was prescribed, with apparent improvement. She soon began to complain of diffuse headaches that were present on awakening and often increased during the night. A physician found no neurologic abnormality. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. After another month or two the headaches diminished, but she slept poorly, was depressed, and lost 9 kg in weight.\n",
      "One month before entry the headaches worsened. Neurologic examination was negative. A CT scan disclosed a ring-enhancing lesion with a smooth internal border in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration-biopsy specimen of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. Dexamethasone, phenytoin sodium, cimetidine, and diazepam were prescribed, and she was referred to this hospital.\n",
      "The patient was right-handed. She was a native of Brazil, where she resided in a metropolitan area and often traveled to sheepherding areas. There was a history of a febrile seizure at the age of three years and of rheumatic fever in childhood. She had experienced intermittent migraine headaches for 10 years. She frequently consumed uncooked beef. There was no history of recent seizures or syncope, sensory loss, fever, allergy, cutaneous lesions, use of tobacco or alcohol, or exposure to infectious diseases.\n",
      "The temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\n",
      "On examination the patient was confused and emotional, with child-like behavior. The head and neck were normal. No lymphadenopathy or rash was found. The lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. The liver and spleen were not felt. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\n",
      "Neurologic examination showed that the patient was oriented as to place but poorly oriented as to time. Remote memory appeared normal, but she recalled only one of five objects after three minutes and could not name the president of her country. She was unable to perform simple mathematical problems and failed on the test of serial subtraction of sevens from 100. The nasal margins of the optic disks appeared slightly elevated. The cranial nerves were otherwise normal except that she avoided looking toward objects in the left superior quadrant of the visual field. Motor functions were normal.

      "Dr. Amy A. Pruitt\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient's country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient's lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient's symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient's seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen's disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen's disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient's lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient's initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient's cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient's course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn't mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\n",

      "Dr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\n",

      "Question: A 37-year-old Brazilian woman with a history of intermittent migraine headaches for 10 years, who frequently consumes uncooked beef and often travels to sheepherding areas, presents with a seven-month history of nausea, vomiting, a syncopal episode, disorientation, anxiety, agitation, and subsequent diffuse headaches worsening at night. Initial CT scan was negative, but a repeat scan revealed a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A biopsy of the left parietal lesion was initially interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. Examination reveals confusion, emotional lability, poor orientation to time, recent memory deficits, dyscalculia, a left superior quadrantanopia, and cortical sensory deficits. Lumbar puncture shows clear CSF with 3 lymphocytes and 1 larger monocyte per cubic millimeter, protein of 84 mg/100 ml, and glucose of 61 mg/100 ml (simultaneous blood glucose of 92 mg/100 ml). Cytocentrifugation reveals 306 cells per milliliter, of which 2% are neutrophils, 53% lymphocytes, and 45% monocytes. Review of the initial biopsy is non-diagnostic.

Two days later a brief syncopal episode occurred, and a few days thereafter she became transiently disoriented, anxious, and agitated. She did not recognize her friends. She was taken to a local hospital, where examination showed that the blood pressure was 170 mm Hg systolic; no other abnormality was found. A tranquilizer was prescribed, with apparent improvement. She soon began to complain of diffuse headaches that were present on awakening and often increased during the night. A physician found no neurologic abnormality. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. After another month or two the headaches diminished, but she slept poorly, was depressed, and lost 9 kg in weight.\\nOne month before entry the headaches worsened. Neurologic examination was negative. A CT scan disclosed a ring-enhancing lesion with a smooth internal border in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration-biopsy specimen of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. Dexamethasone, phenytoin sodium, cimetidine, and diazepam were prescribed, and she was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was right-handed. She was a native of Brazil, where she resided in a metropolitan area and often traveled to sheepherding areas. There was a history of a febrile seizure at the age of three years and of rheumatic fever in childhood. She had experienced intermittent migraine headaches for 10 years. She frequently consumed uncooked beef. There was no history of recent seizures or syncope, sensory loss, fever, allergy, cutaneous lesions, use of tobacco or alcohol, or exposure to infectious diseases.\\nThe temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\\nOn examination the patient was confused and emotional, with child-like behavior. The head and neck were normal. No lymphadenopathy or rash was found. The lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. The liver and spleen were not felt. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\\nNeurologic examination showed that the patient was oriented as to place but poorly oriented as to time.

       "  'reasoning': '\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Amy A. Pruitt\\\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient\\'s country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient\\'s lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient\\'s symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient\\'s seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient\\'s lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months\\' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient\\'s initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months\\' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient\\'s course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn\\'t mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\\n',\n",

Two days later a brief syncopal episode occurred, and a few days thereafter she became transiently disoriented, anxious, and agitated. She did not recognize her friends. She was taken to a local hospital, where examination showed that the blood pressure was 170 mm Hg systolic; no other abnormality was found. A tranquilizer was prescribed, with apparent improvement. She soon began to complain of diffuse headaches that were present on awakening and often increased during the night. A physician found no neurologic abnormality. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. After another month or two the headaches diminished, but she slept poorly, was depressed, and lost 9 kg in weight.\\nOne month before entry the headaches worsened. Neurologic examination was negative. A CT scan disclosed a ring-enhancing lesion with a smooth internal border in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration-biopsy specimen of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. Dexamethasone, phenytoin sodium, cimetidine, and diazepam were prescribed, and she was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was right-handed. She was a native of Brazil, where she resided in a metropolitan area and often traveled to sheepherding areas. There was a history of a febrile seizure at the age of three years and of rheumatic fever in childhood. She had experienced intermittent migraine headaches for 10 years. She frequently consumed uncooked beef. There was no history of recent seizures or syncope, sensory loss, fever, allergy, cutaneous lesions, use of tobacco or alcohol, or exposure to infectious diseases.\\nThe temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\\nOn examination the patient was confused and emotional, with child-like behavior. The head and neck were normal. No lymphadenopathy or rash was found. The lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. The liver and spleen were not felt. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\\nNeurologic examination showed that the patient was oriented as to place but poorly oriented as to time. Remote memory appeared normal, but she recalled only one of five objects after three minutes and could not name the president of her country. She was unable to perform simple mathematical problems and failed on the test of serial subtraction of sevens from 100. The nasal margins of the optic disks appeared slightly elevated. The cranial nerves were otherwise normal except that she avoided looking toward objects in the left superior quadrant of the visual field. Motor functions were normal. Tests of cerebellar function were well performed, and gait and station were normal. The tendon reflexes were ++ and equal; the plantar responses were flexor. Examination of sensory functions was negative. She was unable to interpret any numbers traced on her palms and often indicated the wrong lateralization of pinprick of the upper extremities.\\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 33.7 per cent; the white-cell count was 8300, with 47 per cent neutrophils, 48 per cent lymphocytes, and 5 per cent monocytes. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm per hour, and the total eosinophil count 53 per cubic millimeter. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg per 100 ml (5.0 mmol per liter), the calcium 8.5 mg per 100 ml (2.1 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 4.6 mg per 100 ml (1.5 mmol per liter), and the protein 6.1 g (the albumin 3.5 g, and the globulin 2.6 g) per 100 ml. An electrocardiogram was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal. Films of the thighs showed no calcification within the quadriceps muscles. Films of the paranasal sinuses disclosed that the turbinates were enlarged and the septum was deviated to the left; the paranasal sinuses were clear, and the pituitary fossa was normal; a left posterior parietal craniectomy defect was present. Films of the skull revealed that the pineal gland was not calcified; no abnormal intracranial calcifications were evident. A CT scan of the brain (\\nFig. 1\\n), performed after the injection of contrast material, disclosed an area of ring-enhancement in the right anterior temporal region and another area of enhancement in the left posterolateral parietal area, superior and lateral to the lateral ventricle; neither lesion showed a mass effect or perifocal low density. An ultrasound examination of the liver and gallbladder was negative. Scans of the kidneys showed no evidence of hydronephrosis. An x-ray film of the abdomen was normal. An echocardiogram demonstrated prominence of the left coronary sinus and slight mitral-valve prolapse; no valvular vegetations were seen. An electroencephalogram showed nearly continuous, moderate voltage and generalized theta and delta slowing, more prominent on the left side. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid under an initial pressure of 230 mm; the fluid contained 14 red cells, 3 lymphocytes, and 1 larger monocyte per cubic millimeter; microscopical examination disclosed no microorganisms, including fungi and acid-fast bacilli, and an India-ink preparation was negative; xanthochromia was graded 1 on a scale of 10; the protein was 84 mg, and the glucose 61 mg per 100 ml (3.4 mmol per liter), with a simultaneous blood glucose of 92 mg per 100 ml (5.1 mmol per liter); a serologic test for syphilis and a test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen were negative; immunoelectrophoresis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed that IgG was 6.7 mg (normal, 0 to 8.6 mg), and the albumin 51.5 mg per 100 ml (normal, 11 to 48 mg); agarose-gel electrophoresis disclosed no banding on an eightfold concentrated specimen; a cytocentrifugation study revealed 306 cells per milliliter, of which 2 per cent were neutrophils, 53 per cent lymphocytes, and 45 per cent monocytes. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was negative for tumor cells, and a culture yielded no microorganisms. Two blood cultures were negative. Review of the biopsy specimen of the brain obtained elsewhere disclosed that the material was not diagnostic. On the sixth hospital day a neurosurgical consultant found right homonymous extinction of simultaneous stimuli in both visual fields.\\nAn operation was performed on the eighth hospital day.',\n",
       "   'reasoning': '\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Amy A. Pruitt\\\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient\\'s country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient\\'s lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient\\'s symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient\\'s seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient\\'s lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months\\' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient\\'s initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months\\' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient\\'s course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn\\'t mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\\n',\n",

Initial CT scan was negative, but a repeat scan revealed a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe.

This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases.

The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient\\'s seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient\\'s lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months\\' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient\\'s initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months\\' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient\\'s course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn\\'t mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\\n',\n",

      "Question: A 72-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of abdominal pain.\n",
      "He was well until two months earlier, when pain developed in the right side of the abdomen 12 hours after the ingestion of fatty food. An ultrasound study of the gallbladder revealed several gallstones, 5 to 10 cm in diameter. Cephalexin was prescribed, and the pain disappeared after three days. He was then well until the day of admission, when he was awakened at 5 a.m. by a \"pressure\" pain in the right side of the abdomen, without radiation. He consumed a small breakfast of juice, tea, and toast. The pain slowly improved but worsened again about noon, and he was taken to the Emergency Ward. Examination showed that the abdomen was distended, tender, and silent. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 168, with evidence of a possible inferior myocardial infarct of recent occurrence and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Digoxin and propranolol were injected by vein, and the ventricular rate fell to 100. Another electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial fibrillation at a rate of 112; evidence of a possible infarct persisted, although the ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities were less prominent. After the injection of meperidine for pain the patient vomited for the first time. He was admitted to the hospital.\n",
      "The patient used hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene because of hypertension and allopurinol because of gout. There was a history of atrial fibrillation of uncertain duration, for which digoxin was given. A peptic ulcer had been demonstrated by x-ray studies in the past. He rarely drank alcohol and had not smoked for many years. There was no history of myocardial infarction, chest pain, dyspnea, chills, fever, hepatitis, carcinoma, tuberculosis, diarrhea, constipation, or previous operations.\n",
      "The temperature was 37.2°C, the pulse 108, and the respirations 16. The blood pressure was 200/110 mm Hg.\n",
      "On examination the patient complained of severe abdominal pain. The skin was sweaty; no rash or lymphadenopathy was found. The head and neck were normal; the lungs were clear except for rare inspiratory crackles at the right base. The heart was enlarged, and the rhythm was irregular; a Grade 2 systolic ejection murmur was heard at the cardiac apex and left sternal border. The abdomen was distended; no bowel sounds were heard. Moderate tenderness was elicited to the right of the umbilicus, with slight tenderness in the right upper abdominal quadrant; there was rightsided guarding, without rebound tenderness. No abdominal organs, masses, or hernias were felt, and no tenderness was elicited in the costovertebral angle. There was no peripheral edema. The right femoral pulse was ++, and the left +; no more distal pulses were palpated, and no bruit was heard. The genitalia were normal. Rectal examination was negative except for slight enlargement of the prostate gland. Neurologic examination was negative.\n",
      "The urine gave a + test for protein; the sediment contained a few white cells and hyaline casts, 5 to 10 granular casts, and moderate numbers of bacteria per high-power field. The hematocrit was 50.5 per cent; the white-cell count was 31,400, with 83 per cent neutrophils, 2 per cent band forms, 13 per cent lymphocytes, 1 per cent monocytes, and 1 per cent mctamyelocytes. The prothrombin time and the partial thromboplastin time were normal. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The urea nitrogen was 17 mg per 100 ml (6.1 mmol per liter), the glucose 214 mg per 100 ml (11.9 mmol per liter), the uric acid 4.9 mg per 100 ml (0.29 mmol per liter), the conjugated bilirubin 0.3 mg per 100 ml (5 μmol per liter), the total bilirubin 0.6 mg per 100 ml (10 μmol per liter), the calcium 9.9 mg per 100 ml (2.5 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 3.6 per 100 ml (1.2 mmol per liter), and the protein 7.1 g (the albumin 3.9 g and the globulin 3.2 g) per 100 ml.

X-ray films of the chest showed shallow expansion of the lungs, which appeared clear; the costophrenic angles were sharp; the heart was enlarged, particularly in the area of the left ventricle. Films of the abdomen showed a normal gas pattern; calcifications were observed in the iliac vessels bilaterally, and there were scattered phleboliths in the pelvis; the liver and spleen appeared normal, and the psoas margins were sharp. A film of the abdomen with the patient upright disclosed no evidence of free air.\n",
      "Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and the patient was given digoxin, ampicillin, tobramycin, and fluids by vein; repeated doses of meperidine were administered for pain. Nothing was given by mouth. He remained afebrile, and the blood pressure was normal on most occasions. On the second hospital day the pain was slightly less severe. The abdomen remained distended. The hematocrit was 47.2 per cent; the white-cell count was 26,200, with 90 per cent neutrophils. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 115, without important change. Review of an x-ray film of the chest obtained elsewhere two months earlier showed that the lungs were clear and the heart slightly enlarged. On the third hospital day the patient continued to complain of pain in the middle and lower portions of the abdomen. Minimal bowel sounds were heard. There was tenderness with guarding in the right upper and middle portions of the abdomen. A large volume of liquid stool was passed. The hematocrit was 44.3 per cent, and the white-cell count was 26,700. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg per 100 ml (5.0 mmol per liter). The SGOT was 23 U per milliliter (0.18 μmol. sec\n",

A film of the abdomen with the patient upright again revealed no evidence of free intraperitoneal air. Cultures of blood and urine drawn on entry yielded no microorganisms.\n",
      "On the fourth hospital day the abdominal pain was slightly improved. The patient passed additional liquid stools that gave negative tests for occult blood. Physical examination was unchanged. A barium-enema examination (\n",
      "Fig. 2\n",
      ") revealed dilatation of the small bowel and air within the ascending colon; there was an area of narrowing of the lumen of the transverse colon, several centimeters in length, just to the right of the spine; the area did not change after the injection of glucagon; the mucosa appeared thickened but preserved, and there was evidence of partial large-bowel obstruction at that point; no extraluminal contrast material was observed. A nasogastric tube was inserted and drained dark-green liquid material, which gave a + test for occult blood.\n",

      "Dr. George L. Nardi\\*: In summary, this 72-year-old man with a history of symptomatic gallstones was admitted to the hospital via the Emergency Ward with acute right-sided abdominal pain, right-upper-quadrant tenderness, and leukocytosis. The clinical picture did not change over a three-day period despite antibiotic therapy until the development of diarrhea. A barium-enema examination then showed partial obstruction at the level of the right transverse colon.Dr. Ferrucci, will you show the x-ray films and tell us the role of glucagon in the study?Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: Review of the ultrasound study at the other hospital confirmed the finding of gallstones.A film of the chest shows slight elevation of the right diaphragmatic leaf and mild left ventricular enlargement. There is no evidence of pleural fluid in either costophrenic sulcus.The initial film of the abdomen is normal, with no evidence of dilatation of the small or large bowel and no unusual calcific or gas density visible over the biliary tract or the liver. Films obtained on the third hospital day ([Fig. 1](#f002)) demonstrate numerous moderately dilated loops of small bowel and some dilatation of the colon, particularly the ascending portion and the cecum. These abnormalities are confirmed on a decubitus film, which reveals a long air-fluid level and little or no gas distal to the hepatic flexure.The films from the barium-enema examination ([Fig. 2](#f001)) disclose a segmental area of narrowing at the distal limb of the hepatic flexure. The mucosal folds are somewhat nodular and thickened but are not ulcerated or destroyed. The margins of this lesion taper gradually, suggesting an inflammatory process rather than a neoplasm. There is no indication of gas outside the bowel or over the right upper quadrant.Glucagon is one of many agents that can be used to relieve spasm during a barium-enema examination and impart a more specific appearance to an underlying lesion. We use it regularly in problematic cases of colonic disease.Dr. Nardi: In considering the various organs that might cause trouble in the right side of the abdomen I turned to my copy of the textbook by Cope[1](#core-r001) first published over 60 years ago. He listed four possible causes of disease in this region — a renal infection or tumor, inflammation involving an appendix that has rotated upward, perforation of an ulcer, and acute cholecystitis. After reading his succinct discussion I was delighted to find that he agreed with my impression that the most likely diagnosis in a case of this type is acutecholecystitis. I think that this patient had had a bout of acute cholecystitis two months before admission that responded promptly to antibiotic therapy. When he entered the hospital he had a recurrence of the same disorder, but this time it did not respond to treatment.The clinical course of this patient is typical of acute cholecystitis, although generally there is more fever. For the initial 48 hours he had the characteristic findings of acute cholecystitis. Subsequently, the process either subsides spontaneously or as the result of antibiotics and hydration or it progresses to empyema, gangrene, and perforation. There can be free perforation into the abdominal cavity with peritonitis, subacute perforation with walling off and abscess formation, and chronic perforation, which eventually results in cicatrization and an enteric fistula, most commonly involving the duodenum or colon and less frequently involving the jejunum or ileum. A fistula provides the background for gallstone ileus.I believe that this patient had empyema of the gallbladder, a perforation, subacute inflammation, and abscess formation. The presence of an abscess adjacent to the transverse colon could have produced the changes demonstrated on the x-ray films. The irritation resulted in the passage of large volumes of liquid stools, which gave negative tests for occult blood. In conclusion, my diagnosis is acute cholecystitis with perforation and abscess formation.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Rodkey, this patient was under your care. Will you comment?Dr. Grant V. Rodkey: At the time of admission we wondered if he had acute myocardial infarction. We also considered the possibility of a mesenteric embolus. We were not nearly as straightforward in our evaluation as Dr. Nardi has been and proceeded cautiously. The barium-enema examination was undertaken because we thought that there was evidence of obstruction. We were concerned that the obstruction was not typical and that there might be obstruction of the small bowel as well as the large bowel. It became clear that an operation was required when the barium-enema examination demonstrated narrowing. Our preoperative diagnosis, influenced by Dr. Ferrucci's interpretation, was a probable inflammatory mass. We also considered diverticulitis, perforation by a foreign body, and segmental vascular ischemia.\n",

      "Dr. Rodkey: At operation we found considerable distention of the small bowel with an area of apparent necrosis on its antimesenteric border adjacent to a pelvic abscess. Although a free perforation was not evident, it seemed probable that a leak in the bowel wall had been present and had been sealed off subsequently. The ascending colon was distended. There was a mass in the right transverse colon, which encompassed the fundus of the gallbladder and was wrapped in omentum. The mass was somewhat firm; it did not appear to be an acute abscess. We performed a right colectomy, removed a segment of small bowel from a point just proximal to the sealed perforation in the pelvis, and did an end-to-end anastomosis of the ileum to the midtransverse colon. Because I was not sure whether the patient had a tumor with perforation or an abscess I amputated the fundus of the gallbladder with the specimen and inserted a Cholecystotomy tube into its stump. Subsequently, a cholangiographic examination through this tube revealed no residual stones in the biliary tract. A stone was seen in the fundus of the gallbladder nestled in the abscess or tumor.Dr. G. Richard Dickersin: A 78-cm segment of resected bowel included 45 cm of ileum and 33 cm of cecum, appendix, and colon. A retrocolic mass, 8 by 4 by 4 cm, was present 10 cm from the resection margin of the transverse colon, in the region of the hepatic flexure ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The mass consisted of a large abscess containing purulent, green fluid; its wall was composed of indurated adipose tissue. A portion of the wall of the abscess cavity contained the amputated fundus of the gallbladder, 3 by 2 cm, and a 0.6-cm multifaceted gallstone ([Fig. 4](#f004)).Microscopical examination revealed that the abscess involved only the serosa of the colon. The muscularis, submucosa, and mucosa were edematous and moderately infiltrated by acute and chronic inflammatory cells but were free of necrosis ([Fig. 5](#f005)). Sections of the adherent gallbladder showed marked thickening and acute and chronic inflammation of its entire wall ([Fig. 6](#f006)). Examination of the distal ileum revealed two serosal patches of green exudate, each about 1.5 cm in diameter, but no acute or healed perforation could be identified, either grossly or microscopically.In summary, the pathological findings are compatible with the diagnosis of perforation of the gallbladder secondary to acute cholecystitis, with abscess formation.Perforation of the gallbladder is an infrequent complication of acute cholecystitis and usually results in a localized pericholecystic abscess, but generalized peritonitis or an internal biliary fistula are other complications.[2](#core-r002) Among the various types of biliary fistula that form the cholecystoduodenal fistula is by far the most common, but fistulas to the colon, stomach, and other organs also occur.[3,4](#core-r003) If a stone erodes through the wall of the bowel into the lumen, as might have happened in this patient, gallstone ileus may ensue if an operation is not performed. Usually, however, obstruction occurs only from large stones, generally greater than 2.5 cm,[2](#core-r002) in areas of natural narrowing, such as the ileocecal valve, or of acquired stricture — for example, in the colon at a site of chronic diverticulitis. Gallstone ileus has been reported in only 6 to 14 per cent of patients with fistulas.[5](#core-r005)Dr. Scully: Dr. Rodkey, will you give the follow-up findings?Dr. Rodkey: The patient did well initially but was readmitted two months later with fever, right-upper-quadrant pain, and elevation of the bilirubin level. He also had pulmonary consolidation involving the right lower lobe and a right pleural effusion. Ultrasound study of the biliary tract suggested the presence of a common-duct stone, but a retrograde cannulation of the papilla and a cholangiographic study did not disclose one. However, there appeared to be stenosis of the distal centimeter of the duct, which was treated by endoscopic papillotomy. The pleural effusion and pulmonary changes gradually subsided. It was never determined whether the primary cause of the second admission was pneumonitis or cholangitis, but the patient has recovered.\n",

      "\n",
      "The colonic obstruction is not typical for simple cholecystitis. Cholecystitis primarily affects the gallbladder, not the colon directly. So, we need to consider what could cause colonic obstruction in the setting of cholecystitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that glucagon didn't relieve the narrowing suggests that it's not just a simple spasm. Glucagon is used to relax smooth muscle, so if it's a structural issue or significant inflammation, it wouldn't help. Wait, the abdominal x-ray showing dilated loops of small bowel and colon, especially the ascending colon and cecum, indicates a distal obstruction. The obstruction is severe enough to cause back-up throughout the intestinal tract.\n",

      "Empyema of the gallbladder, gangrene, and perforation are possibilities. Perforation is particularly relevant. If the gallbladder perforates, it could lead to a localized abscess.

An ultrasound study of the gallbladder revealed several gallstones, 5 to 10 cm in diameter. Cephalexin was prescribed, and the pain disappeared after three days. He was then well until the day of admission, when he was awakened at 5 a.m. by a \"pressure\" pain in the right side of the abdomen, without radiation. He consumed a small breakfast of juice, tea, and toast. The pain slowly improved but worsened again about noon, and he was taken to the Emergency Ward. Examination showed that the abdomen was distended, tender, and silent. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 168, with evidence of a possible inferior myocardial infarct of recent occurrence and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Digoxin and propranolol were injected by vein, and the ventricular rate fell to 100. Another electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial fibrillation at a rate of 112; evidence of a possible infarct persisted, although the ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities were less prominent. After the injection of meperidine for pain the patient vomited for the first time. He was admitted to the hospital.\\nThe patient used hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene because of hypertension and allopurinol because of gout. There was a history of atrial fibrillation of uncertain duration, for which digoxin was given. A peptic ulcer had been demonstrated by x-ray studies in the past. He rarely drank alcohol and had not smoked for many years. There was no history of myocardial infarction, chest pain, dyspnea, chills, fever, hepatitis, carcinoma, tuberculosis, diarrhea, constipation, or previous operations.\\nThe temperature was 37.2°C, the pulse 108, and the respirations 16. The blood pressure was 200/110 mm Hg.\\nOn examination the patient complained of severe abdominal pain. The skin was sweaty; no rash or lymphadenopathy was found. The head and neck were normal; the lungs were clear except for rare inspiratory crackles at the right base. The heart was enlarged, and the rhythm was irregular; a Grade 2 systolic ejection murmur was heard at the cardiac apex and left sternal border. The abdomen was distended; no bowel sounds were heard. Moderate tenderness was elicited to the right of the umbilicus, with slight tenderness in the right upper abdominal quadrant; there was rightsided guarding, without rebound tenderness. No abdominal organs, masses, or hernias were felt, and no tenderness was elicited in the costovertebral angle. There was no peripheral edema. The right femoral pulse was ++, and the left +; no more distal pulses were palpated, and no bruit was heard. The genitalia were normal. Rectal examination was negative except for slight enlargement of the prostate gland. Neurologic examination was negative.\\nThe urine gave a + test for protein; the sediment contained a few white cells and hyaline casts, 5 to 10 granular casts, and moderate numbers of bacteria per high-power field. The hematocrit was 50.5 per cent; the white-cell count was 31,400, with 83 per cent neutrophils, 2 per cent band forms, 13 per cent lymphocytes, 1 per cent monocytes, and 1 per cent mctamyelocytes. The prothrombin time and the partial thromboplastin time were normal. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The urea nitrogen was 17 mg per 100 ml (6.1 mmol per liter), the glucose 214 mg per 100 ml (11.9 mmol per liter), the uric acid 4.9 mg per 100 ml (0.29 mmol per liter), the conjugated bilirubin 0.3 mg per 100 ml (5 μmol per liter), the total bilirubin 0.6 mg per 100 ml (10 μmol per liter), the calcium 9.9 mg per 100 ml (2.5 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 3.6 per 100 ml (1.2 mmol per liter), and the protein 7.1 g (the albumin 3.9 g and the globulin 3.2 g) per 100 ml. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) was 34 U per milliliter (0.27 μmol. sec\\n-1\\nper liter), the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 113 U per milliliter (1.89 μmol. sec\\n-1\\nper liter), the creatine kinase (CK) 27 mU per milliliter (0.45 μmol. sec\\n-1\\nper liter), the amylase 14 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 36 IU (0.60 μmol. sec\\n-1\\n) per liter. X-ray films of the chest showed shallow expansion of the lungs, which appeared clear; the costophrenic angles were sharp; the heart was enlarged, particularly in the area of the left ventricle. Films of the abdomen showed a normal gas pattern; calcifications were observed in the iliac vessels bilaterally, and there were scattered phleboliths in the pelvis; the liver and spleen appeared normal, and the psoas margins were sharp. A film of the abdomen with the patient upright disclosed no evidence of free air.\\nSpecimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and the patient was given digoxin, ampicillin, tobramycin, and fluids by vein; repeated doses of meperidine were administered for pain. Nothing was given by mouth. He remained afebrile, and the blood pressure was normal on most occasions. On the second hospital day the pain was slightly less severe. The abdomen remained distended. The hematocrit was 47.2 per cent; the white-cell count was 26,200, with 90 per cent neutrophils. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 115, without important change. Review of an x-ray film of the chest obtained elsewhere two months earlier showed that the lungs were clear and the heart slightly enlarged. On the third hospital day the patient continued to complain of pain in the middle and lower portions of the abdomen. Minimal bowel sounds were heard. There was tenderness with guarding in the right upper and middle portions of the abdomen. A large volume of liquid stool was passed. The hematocrit was 44.3 per cent, and the white-cell count was 26,700. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg per 100 ml (5.0 mmol per liter). The SGOT was 23 U per milliliter (0.18 μmol. sec\\n-1\\nper liter), the LDH 87 U per milliliter (1.5 μmol. sec\\n-1\\nper liter), and the CK 9 mU per milliliter (0.2 μmol. sec\\n-1\\nper liter). Another electrocardiogram was unchanged. X-ray films of the abdomen (\\nFig. 1\\n) showed slight dilatation of the ascending and transverse portions of the colon to the level of the midtransverse portion, with air-fluid levels; multiple loops of slightly dilated small bowel were seen in the midabdomen; no radiopaque biliary calculi were seen. A film of the abdomen with the patient upright again revealed no evidence of free intraperitoneal air. Cultures of blood and urine drawn on entry yielded no microorganisms.\\nOn the fourth hospital day the abdominal pain was slightly improved. The patient passed additional liquid stools that gave negative tests for occult blood. Physical examination was unchanged. A barium-enema examination (\\nFig. 2\\n) revealed dilatation of the small bowel and air within the ascending colon; there was an area of narrowing of the lumen of the transverse colon, several centimeters in length, just to the right of the spine; the area did not change after the injection of glucagon; the mucosa appeared thickened but preserved, and there was evidence of partial large-bowel obstruction at that point; no extraluminal contrast material was observed. A nasogastric tube was inserted and drained dark-green liquid material, which gave a + test for occult blood.\\nOn the sixth hospital day a diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?',\n",
       "  'reasoning': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. George L. Nardi\\\\*: In summary, this 72-year-old man with a history of symptomatic gallstones was admitted to the hospital via the Emergency Ward with acute right-sided abdominal pain, right-upper-quadrant tenderness, and leukocytosis. The clinical picture did not change over a three-day period despite antibiotic therapy until the development of diarrhea. A barium-enema examination then showed partial obstruction at the level of the right transverse colon.Dr. Ferrucci, will you show the x-ray films and tell us the role of glucagon in the study?Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: Review of the ultrasound study at the other hospital confirmed the finding of gallstones.A film of the chest shows slight elevation of the right diaphragmatic leaf and mild left ventricular enlargement. There is no evidence of pleural fluid in either costophrenic sulcus.The initial film of the abdomen is normal, with no evidence of dilatation of the small or large bowel and no unusual calcific or gas density visible over the biliary tract or the liver. Films obtained on the third hospital day ([Fig. 1](#f002)) demonstrate numerous moderately dilated loops of small bowel and some dilatation of the colon, particularly the ascending portion and the cecum. These abnormalities are confirmed on a decubitus film, which reveals a long air-fluid level and little or no gas distal to the hepatic flexure.The films from the barium-enema examination ([Fig. 2](#f001)) disclose a segmental area of narrowing at the distal limb of the hepatic flexure. The mucosal folds are somewhat nodular and thickened but are not ulcerated or destroyed. The margins of this lesion taper gradually, suggesting an inflammatory process rather than a neoplasm. There is no indication of gas outside the bowel or over the right upper quadrant.Glucagon is one of many agents that can be used to relieve spasm during a barium-enema examination and impart a more specific appearance to an underlying lesion. We use it regularly in problematic cases of colonic disease.Dr. Nardi: In considering the various organs that might cause trouble in the right side of the abdomen I turned to my copy of the textbook by Cope[1](#core-r001) first published over 60 years ago. He listed four possible causes of disease in this region — a renal infection or tumor, inflammation involving an appendix that has rotated upward, perforation of an ulcer, and acute cholecystitis. After reading his succinct discussion I was delighted to find that he agreed with my impression that the most likely diagnosis in a case of this type is acutecholecystitis. I think that this patient had had a bout of acute cholecystitis two months before admission that responded promptly to antibiotic therapy. When he entered the hospital he had a recurrence of the same disorder, but this time it did not respond to treatment.The clinical course of this patient is typical of acute cholecystitis, although generally there is more fever. For the initial 48 hours he had the characteristic findings of acute cholecystitis. Subsequently, the process either subsides spontaneously or as the result of antibiotics and hydration or it progresses to empyema, gangrene, and perforation. There can be free perforation into the abdominal cavity with peritonitis, subacute perforation with walling off and abscess formation, and chronic perforation, which eventually results in cicatrization and an enteric fistula, most commonly involving the duodenum or colon and less frequently involving the jejunum or ileum. A fistula provides the background for gallstone ileus.I believe that this patient had empyema of the gallbladder, a perforation, subacute inflammation, and abscess formation. The presence of an abscess adjacent to the transverse colon could have produced the changes demonstrated on the x-ray films. The irritation resulted in the passage of large volumes of liquid stools, which gave negative tests for occult blood. In conclusion, my diagnosis is acute cholecystitis with perforation and abscess formation.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Rodkey, this patient was under your care. Will you comment?Dr. Grant V. Rodkey: At the time of admission we wondered if he had acute myocardial infarction. We also considered the possibility of a mesenteric embolus. We were not nearly as straightforward in our evaluation as Dr. Nardi has been and proceeded cautiously. The barium-enema examination was undertaken because we thought that there was evidence of obstruction. We were concerned that the obstruction was not typical and that there might be obstruction of the small bowel as well as the large bowel. It became clear that an operation was required when the barium-enema examination demonstrated narrowing. Our preoperative diagnosis, influenced by Dr. Ferrucci's interpretation, was a probable inflammatory mass. We also considered diverticulitis, perforation by a foreign body, and segmental vascular ischemia.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Rodkey: At operation we found considerable distention of the small bowel with an area of apparent necrosis on its antimesenteric border adjacent to a pelvic abscess. Although a free perforation was not evident, it seemed probable that a leak in the bowel wall had been present and had been sealed off subsequently. The ascending colon was distended. There was a mass in the right transverse colon, which encompassed the fundus of the gallbladder and was wrapped in omentum. The mass was somewhat firm; it did not appear to be an acute abscess. We performed a right colectomy, removed a segment of small bowel from a point just proximal to the sealed perforation in the pelvis, and did an end-to-end anastomosis of the ileum to the midtransverse colon. Because I was not sure whether the patient had a tumor with perforation or an abscess I amputated the fundus of the gallbladder with the specimen and inserted a Cholecystotomy tube into its stump. Subsequently, a cholangiographic examination through this tube revealed no residual stones in the biliary tract. A stone was seen in the fundus of the gallbladder nestled in the abscess or tumor.Dr. G. Richard Dickersin: A 78-cm segment of resected bowel included 45 cm of ileum and 33 cm of cecum, appendix, and colon. A retrocolic mass, 8 by 4 by 4 cm, was present 10 cm from the resection margin of the transverse colon, in the region of the hepatic flexure ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The mass consisted of a large abscess containing purulent, green fluid; its wall was composed of indurated adipose tissue. A portion of the wall of the abscess cavity contained the amputated fundus of the gallbladder, 3 by 2 cm, and a 0.6-cm multifaceted gallstone ([Fig. 4](#f004)).Microscopical examination revealed that the abscess involved only the serosa of the colon. The muscularis, submucosa, and mucosa were edematous and moderately infiltrated by acute and chronic inflammatory cells but were free of necrosis ([Fig. 5](#f005)). Sections of the adherent gallbladder showed marked thickening and acute and chronic inflammation of its entire wall ([Fig. 6](#f006)). Examination of the distal ileum revealed two serosal patches of green exudate, each about 1.5 cm in diameter, but no acute or healed perforation could be identified, either grossly or microscopically.In summary, the pathological findings are compatible with the diagnosis of perforation of the gallbladder secondary to acute cholecystitis, with abscess formation.Perforation of the gallbladder is an infrequent complication of acute cholecystitis and usually results in a localized pericholecystic abscess, but generalized peritonitis or an internal biliary fistula are other complications.[2](#core-r002) Among the various types of biliary fistula that form the cholecystoduodenal fistula is by far the most common, but fistulas to the colon, stomach, and other organs also occur.[3,4](#core-r003) If a stone erodes through the wall of the bowel into the lumen, as might have happened in this patient, gallstone ileus may ensue if an operation is not performed. Usually, however, obstruction occurs only from large stones, generally greater than 2.5 cm,[2](#core-r002) in areas of natural narrowing, such as the ileocecal valve, or of acquired stricture — for example, in the colon at a site of chronic diverticulitis. Gallstone ileus has been reported in only 6 to 14 per cent of patients with fistulas.[5](#core-r005)Dr. Scully: Dr. Rodkey, will you give the follow-up findings?Dr. Rodkey: The patient did well initially but was readmitted two months later with fever, right-upper-quadrant pain, and elevation of the bilirubin level. He also had pulmonary consolidation involving the right lower lobe and a right pleural effusion. Ultrasound study of the biliary tract suggested the presence of a common-duct stone, but a retrograde cannulation of the papilla and a cholangiographic study did not disclose one. However, there appeared to be stenosis of the distal centimeter of the duct, which was treated by endoscopic papillotomy. The pleural effusion and pulmonary changes gradually subsided.

The heart was enlarged, and the rhythm was irregular; a Grade 2 systolic ejection murmur was heard at the cardiac apex and left sternal border. The abdomen was distended; no bowel sounds were heard. Moderate tenderness was elicited to the right of the umbilicus, with slight tenderness in the right upper abdominal quadrant; there was rightsided guarding, without rebound tenderness. No abdominal organs, masses, or hernias were felt, and no tenderness was elicited in the costovertebral angle. There was no peripheral edema. The right femoral pulse was ++, and the left +; no more distal pulses were palpated, and no bruit was heard. The genitalia were normal. Rectal examination was negative except for slight enlargement of the prostate gland. Neurologic examination was negative.\\nThe urine gave a + test for protein; the sediment contained a few white cells and hyaline casts, 5 to 10 granular casts, and moderate numbers of bacteria per high-power field. The hematocrit was 50.5 per cent; the white-cell count was 31,400, with 83 per cent neutrophils, 2 per cent band forms, 13 per cent lymphocytes, 1 per cent monocytes, and 1 per cent mctamyelocytes. The prothrombin time and the partial thromboplastin time were normal. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The urea nitrogen was 17 mg per 100 ml (6.1 mmol per liter), the glucose 214 mg per 100 ml (11.9 mmol per liter), the uric acid 4.9 mg per 100 ml (0.29 mmol per liter), the conjugated bilirubin 0.3 mg per 100 ml (5 μmol per liter), the total bilirubin 0.6 mg per 100 ml (10 μmol per liter), the calcium 9.9 mg per 100 ml (2.5 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 3.6 per 100 ml (1.2 mmol per liter), and the protein 7.1 g (the albumin 3.9 g and the globulin 3.2 g) per 100 ml. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) was 34 U per milliliter (0.27 μmol. sec\\n-1\\nper liter), the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 113 U per milliliter (1.89 μmol. sec\\n-1\\nper liter), the creatine kinase (CK) 27 mU per milliliter (0.45 μmol. sec\\n-1\\nper liter), the amylase 14 U, and the alkaline phosphatase 36 IU (0.60 μmol. sec\\n-1\\n) per liter. X-ray films of the chest showed shallow expansion of the lungs, which appeared clear; the costophrenic angles were sharp; the heart was enlarged, particularly in the area of the left ventricle. Films of the abdomen showed a normal gas pattern; calcifications were observed in the iliac vessels bilaterally, and there were scattered phleboliths in the pelvis; the liver and spleen appeared normal, and the psoas margins were sharp. A film of the abdomen with the patient upright disclosed no evidence of free air.\\nSpecimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and the patient was given digoxin, ampicillin, tobramycin, and fluids by vein; repeated doses of meperidine were administered for pain. Nothing was given by mouth. He remained afebrile, and the blood pressure was normal on most occasions. On the second hospital day the pain was slightly less severe. The abdomen remained distended. The hematocrit was 47.2 per cent; the white-cell count was 26,200, with 90 per cent neutrophils. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 115, without important change. Review of an x-ray film of the chest obtained elsewhere two months earlier showed that the lungs were clear and the heart slightly enlarged. On the third hospital day the patient continued to complain of pain in the middle and lower portions of the abdomen. Minimal bowel sounds were heard. There was tenderness with guarding in the right upper and middle portions of the abdomen. A large volume of liquid stool was passed. The hematocrit was 44.3 per cent, and the white-cell count was 26,700. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg per 100 ml (5.0 mmol per liter). The SGOT was 23 U per milliliter (0.18 μmol. sec\\n-1\\nper liter), the LDH 87 U per milliliter (1.5 μmol. sec\\n-1\\nper liter), and the CK 9 mU per milliliter (0.2 μmol. sec\\n-1\\nper liter). Another electrocardiogram was unchanged. X-ray films of the abdomen (\\nFig. 1\\n) showed slight dilatation of the ascending and transverse portions of the colon to the level of the midtransverse portion, with air-fluid levels; multiple loops of slightly dilated small bowel were seen in the midabdomen; no radiopaque biliary calculi were seen. A film of the abdomen with the patient upright again revealed no evidence of free intraperitoneal air. Cultures of blood and urine drawn on entry yielded no microorganisms.\\nOn the fourth hospital day the abdominal pain was slightly improved. The patient passed additional liquid stools that gave negative tests for occult blood. Physical examination was unchanged. A barium-enema examination (\\nFig. 2\\n) revealed dilatation of the small bowel and air within the ascending colon; there was an area of narrowing of the lumen of the transverse colon, several centimeters in length, just to the right of the spine; the area did not change after the injection of glucagon; the mucosa appeared thickened but preserved, and there was evidence of partial large-bowel obstruction at that point; no extraluminal contrast material was observed. A nasogastric tube was inserted and drained dark-green liquid material, which gave a + test for occult blood.\\nOn the sixth hospital day a diagnostic procedure was performed.',\n",
       "   'reasoning': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. George L. Nardi\\\\*: In summary, this 72-year-old man with a history of symptomatic gallstones was admitted to the hospital via the Emergency Ward with acute right-sided abdominal pain, right-upper-quadrant tenderness, and leukocytosis. The clinical picture did not change over a three-day period despite antibiotic therapy until the development of diarrhea. A barium-enema examination then showed partial obstruction at the level of the right transverse colon.Dr. Ferrucci, will you show the x-ray films and tell us the role of glucagon in the study?Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci, Jr.: Review of the ultrasound study at the other hospital confirmed the finding of gallstones.A film of the chest shows slight elevation of the right diaphragmatic leaf and mild left ventricular enlargement. There is no evidence of pleural fluid in either costophrenic sulcus.The initial film of the abdomen is normal, with no evidence of dilatation of the small or large bowel and no unusual calcific or gas density visible over the biliary tract or the liver. Films obtained on the third hospital day ([Fig. 1](#f002)) demonstrate numerous moderately dilated loops of small bowel and some dilatation of the colon, particularly the ascending portion and the cecum. These abnormalities are confirmed on a decubitus film, which reveals a long air-fluid level and little or no gas distal to the hepatic flexure.The films from the barium-enema examination ([Fig. 2](#f001)) disclose a segmental area of narrowing at the distal limb of the hepatic flexure. The mucosal folds are somewhat nodular and thickened but are not ulcerated or destroyed. The margins of this lesion taper gradually, suggesting an inflammatory process rather than a neoplasm. There is no indication of gas outside the bowel or over the right upper quadrant.Glucagon is one of many agents that can be used to relieve spasm during a barium-enema examination and impart a more specific appearance to an underlying lesion. We use it regularly in problematic cases of colonic disease.Dr. Nardi: In considering the various organs that might cause trouble in the right side of the abdomen I turned to my copy of the textbook by Cope[1](#core-r001) first published over 60 years ago. He listed four possible causes of disease in this region — a renal infection or tumor, inflammation involving an appendix that has rotated upward, perforation of an ulcer, and acute cholecystitis. After reading his succinct discussion I was delighted to find that he agreed with my impression that the most likely diagnosis in a case of this type is acutecholecystitis. I think that this patient had had a bout of acute cholecystitis two months before admission that responded promptly to antibiotic therapy. When he entered the hospital he had a recurrence of the same disorder, but this time it did not respond to treatment.The clinical course of this patient is typical of acute cholecystitis, although generally there is more fever. For the initial 48 hours he had the characteristic findings of acute cholecystitis. Subsequently, the process either subsides spontaneously or as the result of antibiotics and hydration or it progresses to empyema, gangrene, and perforation. There can be free perforation into the abdominal cavity with peritonitis, subacute perforation with walling off and abscess formation, and chronic perforation, which eventually results in cicatrization and an enteric fistula, most commonly involving the duodenum or colon and less frequently involving the jejunum or ileum. A fistula provides the background for gallstone ileus.I believe that this patient had empyema of the gallbladder, a perforation, subacute inflammation, and abscess formation. The presence of an abscess adjacent to the transverse colon could have produced the changes demonstrated on the x-ray films. The irritation resulted in the passage of large volumes of liquid stools, which gave negative tests for occult blood. In conclusion, my diagnosis is acute cholecystitis with perforation and abscess formation.Dr. Robert E. Scully: Dr. Rodkey, this patient was under your care. Will you comment?Dr. Grant V. Rodkey: At the time of admission we wondered if he had acute myocardial infarction. We also considered the possibility of a mesenteric embolus. We were not nearly as straightforward in our evaluation as Dr. Nardi has been and proceeded cautiously. The barium-enema examination was undertaken because we thought that there was evidence of obstruction. We were concerned that the obstruction was not typical and that there might be obstruction of the small bowel as well as the large bowel. It became clear that an operation was required when the barium-enema examination demonstrated narrowing. Our preoperative diagnosis, influenced by Dr. Ferrucci's interpretation, was a probable inflammatory mass. We also considered diverticulitis, perforation by a foreign body, and segmental vascular ischemia.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Rodkey: At operation we found considerable distention of the small bowel with an area of apparent necrosis on its antimesenteric border adjacent to a pelvic abscess. Although a free perforation was not evident, it seemed probable that a leak in the bowel wall had been present and had been sealed off subsequently. The ascending colon was distended. There was a mass in the right transverse colon, which encompassed the fundus of the gallbladder and was wrapped in omentum. The mass was somewhat firm; it did not appear to be an acute abscess. We performed a right colectomy, removed a segment of small bowel from a point just proximal to the sealed perforation in the pelvis, and did an end-to-end anastomosis of the ileum to the midtransverse colon. Because I was not sure whether the patient had a tumor with perforation or an abscess I amputated the fundus of the gallbladder with the specimen and inserted a Cholecystotomy tube into its stump. Subsequently, a cholangiographic examination through this tube revealed no residual stones in the biliary tract. A stone was seen in the fundus of the gallbladder nestled in the abscess or tumor.Dr. G. Richard Dickersin: A 78-cm segment of resected bowel included 45 cm of ileum and 33 cm of cecum, appendix, and colon. A retrocolic mass, 8 by 4 by 4 cm, was present 10 cm from the resection margin of the transverse colon, in the region of the hepatic flexure ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The mass consisted of a large abscess containing purulent, green fluid; its wall was composed of indurated adipose tissue. A portion of the wall of the abscess cavity contained the amputated fundus of the gallbladder, 3 by 2 cm, and a 0.6-cm multifaceted gallstone ([Fig. 4](#f004)).Microscopical examination revealed that the abscess involved only the serosa of the colon. The muscularis, submucosa, and mucosa were edematous and moderately infiltrated by acute and chronic inflammatory cells but were free of necrosis ([Fig. 5](#f005)). Sections of the adherent gallbladder showed marked thickening and acute and chronic inflammation of its entire wall ([Fig. 6](#f006)). Examination of the distal ileum revealed two serosal patches of green exudate, each about 1.5 cm in diameter, but no acute or healed perforation could be identified, either grossly or microscopically.In summary, the pathological findings are compatible with the diagnosis of perforation of the gallbladder secondary to acute cholecystitis, with abscess formation.Perforation of the gallbladder is an infrequent complication of acute cholecystitis and usually results in a localized pericholecystic abscess, but generalized peritonitis or an internal biliary fistula are other complications.[2](#core-r002) Among the various types of biliary fistula that form the cholecystoduodenal fistula is by far the most common, but fistulas to the colon, stomach, and other organs also occur.[3,4](#core-r003) If a stone erodes through the wall of the bowel into the lumen, as might have happened in this patient, gallstone ileus may ensue if an operation is not performed. Usually, however, obstruction occurs only from large stones, generally greater than 2.5 cm,[2](#core-r002) in areas of natural narrowing, such as the ileocecal valve, or of acquired stricture — for example, in the colon at a site of chronic diverticulitis. Gallstone ileus has been reported in only 6 to 14 per cent of patients with fistulas.[5](#core-r005)Dr. Scully: Dr. Rodkey, will you give the follow-up findings?Dr. Rodkey: The patient did well initially but was readmitted two months later with fever, right-upper-quadrant pain, and elevation of the bilirubin level. He also had pulmonary consolidation involving the right lower lobe and a right pleural effusion. Ultrasound study of the biliary tract suggested the presence of a common-duct stone, but a retrograde cannulation of the papilla and a cholangiographic study did not disclose one. However, there appeared to be stenosis of the distal centimeter of the duct, which was treated by endoscopic papillotomy. The pleural effusion and pulmonary changes gradually subsided. It was never determined whether the primary cause of the second admission was pneumonitis or cholangitis, but the patient has recovered.\\n\",\n",

       "   'reasoning': \"Okay, let's think this through.\\n\\nWe have a 72-year-old with a history of gallstones presenting with right-sided abdominal pain, right-upper-quadrant tenderness, and leukocytosis. This immediately points towards a biliary issue, most likely acute cholecystitis. The gallstones are a risk factor, the location of the pain and tenderness fits, and the leukocytosis suggests inflammation or infection.\\n\\nAntibiotics and hydration are standard initial management for cholecystitis, so that makes sense.\\n\\nHowever, the patient develops diarrhea, and a barium enema shows partial obstruction at the right transverse colon with nodular, thickened mucosal folds, but no ulceration. This is where it gets more complicated.\\n\\nThe colonic obstruction is not typical for simple cholecystitis. Cholecystitis primarily affects the gallbladder, not the colon directly. So, we need to consider what could cause colonic obstruction in the setting of cholecystitis.\\n\\nThe fact that glucagon didn't relieve the narrowing suggests that it's not just a simple spasm. Glucagon is used to relax smooth muscle, so if it's a structural issue or significant inflammation, it wouldn't help.\\n\\nThe abdominal x-ray showing dilated loops of small bowel and colon, especially the ascending colon and cecum, indicates a distal obstruction. The obstruction is severe enough to cause back-up throughout the intestinal tract.\\n\\nThe nasogastric tube draining dark-green liquid positive for occult blood is concerning. The dark-green color suggests bile, meaning the obstruction is distal to the duodenum. The occult blood suggests some degree of mucosal damage or bleeding.\\n\\nSo, we have right upper quadrant inflammation, colonic obstruction, and evidence of bleeding.\\n\\nCould it be a primary colonic issue like colon cancer? It's possible, but the history of gallstones and the initial presentation strongly suggest a connection to the biliary system. Also, colon cancer would be less likely to present with acute right upper quadrant pain and tenderness.\\n\\nCould it be diverticulitis? Diverticulitis can cause inflammation and obstruction, but it's more common in the left colon. While right-sided diverticulitis is possible, the gallbladder history makes it less likely as the primary cause.\\n\\nCould it be ischemic colitis? Ischemic colitis can cause inflammation, bleeding, and obstruction. However, it usually presents with more severe pain and bloody stools. The right upper quadrant tenderness is also less typical.\\n\\nGiven the history of gallstones and the initial presentation consistent with cholecystitis, a complication of cholecystitis is the most likely explanation.\\n\\nWhat complications of cholecystitis could cause colonic obstruction?\\n\\nEmpyema of the gallbladder, gangrene, and perforation are possibilities. Perforation is particularly relevant.\\n\\nIf the gallbladder perforates, it could lead to a localized abscess. If that abscess is adjacent to the colon, it could cause inflammation and extrinsic compression, leading to obstruction. The nodular, thickened mucosal folds could be due to inflammation and edema from the nearby abscess.\\n\\nThe occult blood could be from irritation of the colonic mucosa by the abscess or from a small amount of bleeding from the perforation itself.\\n\\nThe diarrhea could be due to the inflammatory process irritating the bowel.\\n\\nGallstone ileus is another possibility, where a gallstone passes through a fistula into the bowel and causes obstruction. However, gallstone ileus typically obstructs the small bowel, often at the ileocecal valve, not the colon. While a fistula to the colon is possible, it's less common.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely underlying pathology is perforation of the gallbladder secondary to acute cholecystitis, with abscess formation causing extrinsic compression and inflammation of the right transverse colon, leading to partial obstruction.\\n\",\n",

      "Question: A 37-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of headaches and memory loss.\n",
      "She was well until seven months earlier, when she began to experience nausea and vomiting. Two days later a brief syncopal episode occurred, and a few days thereafter she became transiently disoriented, anxious, and agitated. She did not recognize her friends. She was taken to a local hospital, where examination showed that the blood pressure was 170 mm Hg systolic; no other abnormality was found. A tranquilizer was prescribed, with apparent improvement. She soon began to complain of diffuse headaches that were present on awakening and often increased during the night. A physician found no neurologic abnormality. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. After another month or two the headaches diminished, but she slept poorly, was depressed, and lost 9 kg in weight.\n",
      "One month before entry the headaches worsened. Neurologic examination was negative. A CT scan disclosed a ring-enhancing lesion with a smooth internal border in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration-biopsy specimen of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. Dexamethasone, phenytoin sodium, cimetidine, and diazepam were prescribed, and she was referred to this hospital.\n",
      "The patient was right-handed. She was a native of Brazil, where she resided in a metropolitan area and often traveled to sheepherding areas. There was a history of a febrile seizure at the age of three years and of rheumatic fever in childhood. She had experienced intermittent migraine headaches for 10 years. She frequently consumed uncooked beef. There was no history of recent seizures or syncope, sensory loss, fever, allergy, cutaneous lesions, use of tobacco or alcohol, or exposure to infectious diseases.\n",
      "The temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\n",
      "On examination the patient was confused and emotional, with child-like behavior. The head and neck were normal. No lymphadenopathy or rash was found. The lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. The liver and spleen were not felt. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\n",
      "Neurologic examination showed that the patient was oriented as to place but poorly oriented as to time. Remote memory appeared normal, but she recalled only one of five objects after three minutes and could not name the president of her country. She was unable to perform simple mathematical problems and failed on the test of serial subtraction of sevens from 100. The nasal margins of the optic disks appeared slightly elevated. The cranial nerves were otherwise normal except that she avoided looking toward objects in the left superior quadrant of the visual field. Motor functions were normal. Tests of cerebellar function were well performed, and gait and station were normal. The tendon reflexes were ++ and equal; the plantar responses were flexor. Examination of sensory functions was negative. She was unable to interpret any numbers traced on her palms and often indicated the wrong lateralization of pinprick of the upper extremities.\n",
      "The urine was normal. The hematocrit was 33.7 per cent; the white-cell count was 8300, with 47 per cent neutrophils, 48 per cent lymphocytes, and 5 per cent monocytes. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm per hour, and the total eosinophil count 53 per cubic millimeter. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg per 100 ml (5.0 mmol per liter), the calcium 8.5 mg per 100 ml (2.1 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 4.6 mg per 100 ml (1.5 mmol per liter), and the protein 6.1 g (the albumin 3.5 g, and the globulin 2.6 g) per 100 ml. An electrocardiogram was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal. Films of the thighs showed no calcification within the quadriceps muscles. Films of the paranasal sinuses disclosed that the turbinates were enlarged and the septum was deviated to the left; the paranasal sinuses were clear, and the pituitary fossa was normal; a left posterior parietal craniectomy defect was present. Films of the skull revealed that the pineal gland was not calcified; no abnormal intracranial calcifications were evident. A CT scan of the brain (\n",
      "Fig. 1\n",
      "), performed after the injection of contrast material, disclosed an area of ring-enhancement in the right anterior temporal region and another area of enhancement in the left posterolateral parietal area, superior and lateral to the lateral ventricle; neither lesion showed a mass effect or perifocal low density. An ultrasound examination of the liver and gallbladder was negative. Scans of the kidneys showed no evidence of hydronephrosis. An x-ray film of the abdomen was normal. An echocardiogram demonstrated prominence of the left coronary sinus and slight mitral-valve prolapse; no valvular vegetations were seen. An electroencephalogram showed nearly continuous, moderate voltage and generalized theta and delta slowing, more prominent on the left side. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid under an initial pressure of 230 mm; the fluid contained 14 red cells, 3 lymphocytes, and 1 larger monocyte per cubic millimeter; microscopical examination disclosed no microorganisms, including fungi and acid-fast bacilli, and an India-ink preparation was negative; xanthochromia was graded 1 on a scale of 10; the protein was 84 mg, and the glucose 61 mg per 100 ml (3.4 mmol per liter), with a simultaneous blood glucose of 92 mg per 100 ml (5.1 mmol per liter); a serologic test for syphilis and a test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen were negative; immunoelectrophoresis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed that IgG was 6.7 mg (normal, 0 to 8.6 mg), and the albumin 51.5 mg per 100 ml (normal, 11 to 48 mg); agarose-gel electrophoresis disclosed no banding on an eightfold concentrated specimen; a cytocentrifugation study revealed 306 cells per milliliter, of which 2 per cent were neutrophils, 53 per cent lymphocytes, and 45 per cent monocytes. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was negative for tumor cells, and a culture yielded no microorganisms. Two blood cultures were negative. Review of the biopsy specimen of the brain obtained elsewhere disclosed that the material was not diagnostic. On the sixth hospital day a neurosurgical consultant found right homonymous extinction of simultaneous stimuli in both visual fields.\n",

      "----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Amy A. Pruitt\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient's country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient's lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient's symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient's seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen's disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen's disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient's lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient's initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient's cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient's course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn't mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\n",

      "Dr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\n",

      "Question: A 37-year-old Brazilian woman with a history of intermittent migraine headaches and frequent consumption of uncooked beef presented with a seven-month history of nausea, vomiting, syncopal episode, disorientation, anxiety, agitation, and headaches. Initial CT scan was negative, but a repeat scan one month prior to admission revealed a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration biopsy of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. On admission, neurological examination revealed confusion, disorientation to time, memory deficits, dyscalculia, left superior quadrantanopia, and cortical sensory deficits. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated protein level (84 mg/100 ml) and a monocytic pleocytosis (45% monocytes). A review of the initial biopsy specimen was non-diagnostic.

       "{'original': {'question': 'A 37-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of headaches and memory loss.\\nShe was well until seven months earlier, when she began to experience nausea and vomiting. Two days later a brief syncopal episode occurred, and a few days thereafter she became transiently disoriented, anxious, and agitated. She did not recognize her friends. She was taken to a local hospital, where examination showed that the blood pressure was 170 mm Hg systolic; no other abnormality was found. A tranquilizer was prescribed, with apparent improvement. She soon began to complain of diffuse headaches that were present on awakening and often increased during the night. A physician found no neurologic abnormality. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. After another month or two the headaches diminished, but she slept poorly, was depressed, and lost 9 kg in weight.\\nOne month before entry the headaches worsened. Neurologic examination was negative. A CT scan disclosed a ring-enhancing lesion with a smooth internal border in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration-biopsy specimen of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. Dexamethasone, phenytoin sodium, cimetidine, and diazepam were prescribed, and she was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was right-handed. She was a native of Brazil, where she resided in a metropolitan area and often traveled to sheepherding areas. There was a history of a febrile seizure at the age of three years and of rheumatic fever in childhood. She had experienced intermittent migraine headaches for 10 years. She frequently consumed uncooked beef. There was no history of recent seizures or syncope, sensory loss, fever, allergy, cutaneous lesions, use of tobacco or alcohol, or exposure to infectious diseases.\\nThe temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\\nOn examination the patient was confused and emotional, with child-like behavior. The head and neck were normal. No lymphadenopathy or rash was found. The lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. The liver and spleen were not felt. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\\nNeurologic examination showed that the patient was oriented as to place but poorly oriented as to time. Remote memory appeared normal, but she recalled only one of five objects after three minutes and could not name the president of her country. She was unable to perform simple mathematical problems and failed on the test of serial subtraction of sevens from 100. The nasal margins of the optic disks appeared slightly elevated. The cranial nerves were otherwise normal except that she avoided looking toward objects in the left superior quadrant of the visual field. Motor functions were normal. Tests of cerebellar function were well performed, and gait and station were normal. The tendon reflexes were ++ and equal; the plantar responses were flexor. Examination of sensory functions was negative. She was unable to interpret any numbers traced on her palms and often indicated the wrong lateralization of pinprick of the upper extremities.\\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 33.7 per cent; the white-cell count was 8300, with 47 per cent neutrophils, 48 per cent lymphocytes, and 5 per cent monocytes. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm per hour, and the total eosinophil count 53 per cubic millimeter. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg per 100 ml (5.0 mmol per liter), the calcium 8.5 mg per 100 ml (2.1 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 4.6 mg per 100 ml (1.5 mmol per liter), and the protein 6.1 g (the albumin 3.5 g, and the globulin 2.6 g) per 100 ml. An electrocardiogram was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal. Films of the thighs showed no calcification within the quadriceps muscles. Films of the paranasal sinuses disclosed that the turbinates were enlarged and the septum was deviated to the left; the paranasal sinuses were clear, and the pituitary fossa was normal; a left posterior parietal craniectomy defect was present. Films of the skull revealed that the pineal gland was not calcified; no abnormal intracranial calcifications were evident. A CT scan of the brain (\\nFig. 1\\n), performed after the injection of contrast material, disclosed an area of ring-enhancement in the right anterior temporal region and another area of enhancement in the left posterolateral parietal area, superior and lateral to the lateral ventricle; neither lesion showed a mass effect or perifocal low density. An ultrasound examination of the liver and gallbladder was negative. Scans of the kidneys showed no evidence of hydronephrosis. An x-ray film of the abdomen was normal. An echocardiogram demonstrated prominence of the left coronary sinus and slight mitral-valve prolapse; no valvular vegetations were seen. An electroencephalogram showed nearly continuous, moderate voltage and generalized theta and delta slowing, more prominent on the left side. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid under an initial pressure of 230 mm; the fluid contained 14 red cells, 3 lymphocytes, and 1 larger monocyte per cubic millimeter; microscopical examination disclosed no microorganisms, including fungi and acid-fast bacilli, and an India-ink preparation was negative; xanthochromia was graded 1 on a scale of 10; the protein was 84 mg, and the glucose 61 mg per 100 ml (3.4 mmol per liter), with a simultaneous blood glucose of 92 mg per 100 ml (5.1 mmol per liter); a serologic test for syphilis and a test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen were negative; immunoelectrophoresis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed that IgG was 6.7 mg (normal, 0 to 8.6 mg), and the albumin 51.5 mg per 100 ml (normal, 11 to 48 mg); agarose-gel electrophoresis disclosed no banding on an eightfold concentrated specimen; a cytocentrifugation study revealed 306 cells per milliliter, of which 2 per cent were neutrophils, 53 per cent lymphocytes, and 45 per cent monocytes. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was negative for tumor cells, and a culture yielded no microorganisms. Two blood cultures were negative. Review of the biopsy specimen of the brain obtained elsewhere disclosed that the material was not diagnostic. On the sixth hospital day a neurosurgical consultant found right homonymous extinction of simultaneous stimuli in both visual fields.\\nAn operation was performed on the eighth hospital day.\\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?',\n",
       "  'reasoning': '\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Amy A. Pruitt\\\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient\\'s country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient\\'s lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient\\'s symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient\\'s seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient\\'s lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months\\' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient\\'s initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months\\' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient\\'s course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn\\'t mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\\n',\n",

Two days later a brief syncopal episode occurred, and a few days thereafter she became transiently disoriented, anxious, and agitated. She did not recognize her friends. She was taken to a local hospital, where examination showed that the blood pressure was 170 mm Hg systolic; no other abnormality was found. A tranquilizer was prescribed, with apparent improvement. She soon began to complain of diffuse headaches that were present on awakening and often increased during the night. A physician found no neurologic abnormality. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. After another month or two the headaches diminished, but she slept poorly, was depressed, and lost 9 kg in weight.\\nOne month before entry the headaches worsened.

Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\\nNeurologic examination showed that the patient was oriented as to place but poorly oriented as to time. Remote memory appeared normal, but she recalled only one of five objects after three minutes and could not name the president of her country. She was unable to perform simple mathematical problems and failed on the test of serial subtraction of sevens from 100. The nasal margins of the optic disks appeared slightly elevated. The cranial nerves were otherwise normal except that she avoided looking toward objects in the left superior quadrant of the visual field. Motor functions were normal. Tests of cerebellar function were well performed, and gait and station were normal. The tendon reflexes were ++ and equal; the plantar responses were flexor. Examination of sensory functions was negative. She was unable to interpret any numbers traced on her palms and often indicated the wrong lateralization of pinprick of the upper extremities.\\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 33.7 per cent; the white-cell count was 8300, with 47 per cent neutrophils, 48 per cent lymphocytes, and 5 per cent monocytes. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm per hour, and the total eosinophil count 53 per cubic millimeter. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg per 100 ml (5.0 mmol per liter), the calcium 8.5 mg per 100 ml (2.1 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 4.6 mg per 100 ml (1.5 mmol per liter), and the protein 6.1 g (the albumin 3.5 g, and the globulin 2.6 g) per 100 ml. An electrocardiogram was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal. Films of the thighs showed no calcification within the quadriceps muscles. Films of the paranasal sinuses disclosed that the turbinates were enlarged and the septum was deviated to the left; the paranasal sinuses were clear, and the pituitary fossa was normal; a left posterior parietal craniectomy defect was present. Films of the skull revealed that the pineal gland was not calcified; no abnormal intracranial calcifications were evident. A CT scan of the brain (\\nFig. 1\\n), performed after the injection of contrast material, disclosed an area of ring-enhancement in the right anterior temporal region and another area of enhancement in the left posterolateral parietal area, superior and lateral to the lateral ventricle; neither lesion showed a mass effect or perifocal low density. An ultrasound examination of the liver and gallbladder was negative. Scans of the kidneys showed no evidence of hydronephrosis. An x-ray film of the abdomen was normal. An echocardiogram demonstrated prominence of the left coronary sinus and slight mitral-valve prolapse; no valvular vegetations were seen. An electroencephalogram showed nearly continuous, moderate voltage and generalized theta and delta slowing, more prominent on the left side. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid under an initial pressure of 230 mm; the fluid contained 14 red cells, 3 lymphocytes, and 1 larger monocyte per cubic millimeter; microscopical examination disclosed no microorganisms, including fungi and acid-fast bacilli, and an India-ink preparation was negative; xanthochromia was graded 1 on a scale of 10; the protein was 84 mg, and the glucose 61 mg per 100 ml (3.4 mmol per liter), with a simultaneous blood glucose of 92 mg per 100 ml (5.1 mmol per liter); a serologic test for syphilis and a test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen were negative; immunoelectrophoresis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed that IgG was 6.7 mg (normal, 0 to 8.6 mg), and the albumin 51.5 mg per 100 ml (normal, 11 to 48 mg); agarose-gel electrophoresis disclosed no banding on an eightfold concentrated specimen; a cytocentrifugation study revealed 306 cells per milliliter, of which 2 per cent were neutrophils, 53 per cent lymphocytes, and 45 per cent monocytes. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was negative for tumor cells, and a culture yielded no microorganisms. Two blood cultures were negative. Review of the biopsy specimen of the brain obtained elsewhere disclosed that the material was not diagnostic.

       "   'reasoning': '\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Amy A. Pruitt\\\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient\\'s country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient\\'s lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient\\'s symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient\\'s seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient\\'s lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months\\' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient\\'s initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months\\' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient\\'s course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn\\'t mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\\n',\n",

Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient\\'s lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months\\' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient\\'s initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months\\' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient\\'s course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn\\'t mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\\n',\n",

      "Question: A 16-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of fever, rash, and severe ocular disease.\n",
      "The patient had been in good health until three months earlier, when small, painful, mildly pruritic vesicles appeared on her left thigh. She was given oral and topical medications, and the rash disappeared within a few days, leaving hyperpigmented scars. Thereafter, she had intermittent fever, fatigue, and anorexia, with a weight loss of 14 kg.\n",
      "Two weeks before admission, the patient's left ear began to drain. Several days before admission, painful intraoral lesions appeared. One day before admission, clarithromycin was prescribed for recurrent drainage from the left ear, and vision in the right eye decreased markedly. An examination elsewhere showed scleritis and uveitis. Topical erythromycin was administered, and the patient was referred to this hospital.\n",
      "The patient had been born in the United States to Cambodian parents. At the age of 14 years, the patient had given birth to a healthy daughter after an uncomplicated pregnancy. The hematocrit during her pregnancy was 36 percent. There was a history of mild varicella and sex with multiple partners. She had had an abnormal vaginal smear, but repeated smears during the year before admission were negative. She had received medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension intramuscularly for a year, followed by amenorrhea. She had recently noted hair loss. There was no history of tuberculosis or exposure to it or of travel to Cambodia.\n",
      "The temperature was 39.2°C, the pulse was 130, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\n",
      "The patient appeared acutely and chronically ill. Examination revealed marked swelling around the right orbit, with severe chemosis, diffuse conjunctival infection, and tenderness of the sclera on palpation. Visual acuity was limited, with an ability to discern the number of fingers held up at a maximal distance of 0.6 m, and extraocular movement was restricted laterally by the chemosis. There was a large right retinal detachment, probably exudative, involving the macula. There was minimal erythema of the left eye, with slight scleral thickening; the fundus appeared normal. Visual acuity was 20/40. Greenish pus issued from a perforation in the left tympanic membrane. The right ear was normal. A few scattered ulcers covered by white exudate were observed on the buccal mucosa and soft palate, and several petechiae were scattered on the soft palate. There was a small amount of exudate on the left tonsil. Examination of the skin showed a few periungual telangiectases, prominent palmar erythema, and hyperpigmented macular lesions on the left anterior thigh in a distribution resembling the L2 dermatome. Slightly atrophic erythematous plaques with silvery scales were present on each upper eyelid and in the right malar region. Shotty posterior cervical and right axillary lymph nodes and left inguinal lymph nodes, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, were palpable. A nonradiating, grade 2 systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border.\n",
      "The urine was positive (++) for protein. The sediment contained 5 to 10 red cells, 10 to 20 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power field; there were 10 to 20 hyaline casts per low-power field. Other laboratory tests were performed (\n",

      "Dr. Jane G. Schaller[\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic images?Dr. Robert T. Bramson: The CT scan ([Figure 1](#f01)) of the right eye shows marked thickening of the soft tissue within and around the globe. The frontal, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses appear normal, but the left mastoid air cells are sclerotic and filled with fluid. There is slight, generalized cerebral atrophy. There is no evidence of a space-occupying lesion.Dr. Schaller: Being a rheumatologist, I shall begin with a discussion of rheumatic diseases, although there are no test results that are clearly diagnostic of rheumatic disease in this case. It is crucial in cases of this type to consider specifically treatable diseases that can mimic rheumatic diseases, including infectious diseases, malignant tumors, and other conditions with traumatic or environmental causes. In the present case, the question of infectious disease, particularly varicella–zoster virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, looms large, and a malignant tumor is also possible.Could any one rheumatic disease explain all the findings in this case? Systemic lupus erythematosus could,[1](#core-r001) but we have no information about serum complement levels or important serologic tests, including those for antinuclear antibodies and for antibodies to double-stranded DNA and Sm, Ro, and La antigens. Although antinuclear-antibody–negative lupus has been reported,[2](#core-r002) two negative tests at a good laboratory effectively rule out systemic lupus erythematosus.The diagnostic criteria for lupus are shown in [Table 3](#t03). The malar rash in this patient, although puzzling as described, is consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. A skin biopsy can be helpful diagnostically, since a rash associated with lupus has a characteristic histopathological appearance, although one hesitates to perform a biopsy in highly visible regions, such as the face. The dermatomal vesicular rash that heralded this patient's illness and suggested the presence of varicella–zoster virus is also consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. Lupus-associated rashes may take many forms and may affect any part of the body. A similar vesicular rash with a dermatomal distribution has been described in a teenager with lupus.[3](#core-r003) The patient under discussion had painful intraoral lesions and a renal disorder, with urinary findings that were consistent with the presence of early lupus nephritis. The finding of cerebral atrophy on the CT scan in this case is consistent with the presence of lupus cerebritis.[4](#core-r004) The patient had a hematologic disorder with severe anemia and a positive Coombs' test; her reticulocytosis was only mild, possibly because of the severity of her illness. The description of the blood smear does not help clarify the cause of the anemia, but it does make thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or the hemolytic–uremic syndrome unlikely. The apparent absence of anemia during the patient's pregnancy makes thalassemia or another type of hereditary anemia unlikely. Her low serum iron levels and total iron-binding capacity are consistent with the presence of iron deficiency and chronic disease. The patient had lymphopenia on a differential count; as a criterion for the diagnosis of lupus, lymphopenia is defined as fewer than 1500 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter; her absolute lymphocyte count was 528 per cubic millimeter. She had a biologic false positive serologic test for syphilis, with a negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum.* It would be interesting to know the results of these tests at the time of her pregnancy two years earlier.Even in the absence of information about a test for antinuclear antibodies, this patient's disease appears to meet the diagnostic criteria for lupus. If a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative, however, I would consider lupus an unlikely diagnosis.Are the other clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis of lupus? The most striking component of the eye disease was scleritis. Among patients with rheumatic diseases, scleritis is seen most often in those with rheumatoid factor–positive rheumatoid arthritis[5](#core-r005) or Wegener's granulomatosis[5–9](#core-r005); it is occasionally seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus[10,11](#core-r010) or other conditions, including sarcoidosis, Behçet's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's syndrome, dermatomyositis, polyarteritis nodosa and other forms of vasculitis, and polychondritis.[5,6,9,12–15](#core-r005) This patient also had iridocyclitis and choroiditis, as well as a large right retinal detachment, which was probably related to the posterior scleritis. Many infections can cause scleritis,[16–21](#core-r016) including HIV infection, varicella–zoster virus, Lyme disease, syphilis, and tuberculosis.Other findings consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in this patient include the chronic course of the illness, fever, weight loss, malaise, alopecia, periungual telangiectasia, palmar erythema, shotty lymphadenopathy, and petechiae on the soft palate. Laboratory findings that are consistent with the diagnosis, in addition to those already mentioned, include the very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels, the elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, the very high level of ferritin (which may have been acting as an acute-phase reactant), and the elevated globulin fraction, with a reversal of the ratio of albumin to globulin. The slight hypocalcemia may be related to the low serum albumin level.Ear drainage is a nonspecific finding for systemic lupus erythematosus. The radiographs suggest the presence of a chronic process in the ear and mastoid that is unrelated to the current illness. In summary, nearly all the clinical and laboratory findings are consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.The findings in this case are also consistent with the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, although the disorder is rare in young people.[22,23](#core-r022) Features that suggest this diagnosis include the drainage from the ear, the oral ulcers, the abnormal results of urinalysis, the scleritis, and the debilitating nature of the chronic febrile illness. The criteria for the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis are shown in [Table 4](#t04).[24](#core-r024) This patient had oral ulcers. She had no nasal involvement, but she did have involvement of the ear, mastoid, and sinuses, which occurs in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. The findings on the chest radiograph were normal, but microhematuria was present. Although ocular involvement is not a diagnostic criterion, severe scleritis occurs in up to 16 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis.[5–9](#core-r005) Of most immediate interest diagnostically would be the results of a test for antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). The cytoplasmic type of ANCA (c-ANCA) is present in about 80 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and is characteristic of the disorder.[25,26](#core-r025) A few features of this case that are not suggestive of the diagnosis, however, are the facial rash, the positive Coombs' test, and the biologic false positive test for syphilis.Behçet's disease can cause oral ulcers and ocular disease ([Table 5](#t05)),[27](#core-r027) but the latter is most often manifested as uveitis, retinitis, or both[13](#core-r013); scleritis is rare. This patient did not have recurrent genital ulcers, a common feature of Behçet's disease. The rash resembling varicella–zoster was probably not the papulopustular lesion characteristic of Behçet's disease. Finally, Behçet's disease is not associated with hemolytic anemia or a biologic false positive test for syphilis, two findings reported in this case.Sarcoidosis[14,28](#core-r014) can cause uveitis, anergy on delayed-hypersensitivity testing, elevated liver-function values, renal involvement, and occasionally scleritis, although it is not the usual form of eye disease. However, the degree of anemia reported in this case is atypical of sarcoidosis. The angiotensin-converting–enzyme level was normal in this case, but it is elevated in only about 60 percent of cases of sarcoidosis. Chest involvement, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, arthritis, and erythema nodosum, which are common findings in cases of sarcoidosis, were absent in this case.Two types of spondyloarthropathy should also be mentioned.[15,29](#core-r015) Reiter's syndrome could account for the prolonged febrile illness, the oral ulcers, and even the urinary findings, but the eye disease associated with Reiter's syndrome is generally conjunctivitis, keratitis, or acute iritis, not scleritis. Furthermore, this patient had no musculoskeletal involvement, a hallmark of Reiter's syndrome. Inflammatory bowel disease, notably Crohn's disease, can present in young people without gastrointestinal symptoms. It can be associated with mouth sores and a prolonged febrile illness and can cause scleritis,[15](#core-r015) but the serologic findings in this case are not consistent with the presence of Crohn's disease.Polyarteritis is a diagnostic consideration, but it is usually not associated with a positive Coombs' test or a biologic false positive test for syphilis. Other rheumatic conditions that have been associated with scleritis include seropositive rheumatoid arthritis,[30](#core-r030) for which there is no clinical evidence in this case, and dermatomyositis,[31](#core-r031) which could explain the patient's facial and periungual rashes. Although she had no history of myalgia or muscle weakness, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels could be due to muscle disease rather than liver disease.It is very important to consider specifically treatable diseases, such as infectious diseases, before diagnosing a rheumatic disease, since treatments for rheumatic diseases are nonspecific and may mask the symptoms and signs of infectious diseases. Could an infectious disease explain all the findings in this case, or at least some of them, such as the ear drainage and the ocular disease? The negative blood cultures make bacterial sepsis unlikely.The patient probably also had herpes zoster, although only about 5 percent of cases occur before the age of 16 years.[32](#core-r032) In children with herpes zoster, a predisposing disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, an immunodeficiency disorder, or a malignant tumor should be considered. Varicella–zoster virus can cause ocular disease,[19](#core-r019) which is occasionally manifested as scleritis; it can involve the liver, with slightly elevated liver-function values, and can cause a prolonged febrile illness, particularly in a predisposed host. This girl had a history of chickenpox. There is evidence that chickenpox in infancy may be associated with zoster during later childhood,[33](#core-r033) but herpes zoster alone would not explain the positive Coombs' test, the severe anemia, or the false positive serologic test for syphilis. The administration of acyclovir on admission indicates that the patient's physicians also thought of varicella–zoster as either a cause of her illness or a factor contributing to it.Dr. Quan D. Nguyen: The initial lesions on the patient's face and around her right eye were herpetic. We were very concerned about the possibility of systemic herpetic infection and decided to administer intravenous acyclovir as part of the initial treatment.Dr. Schaller: HIV infection could cause all the features of this patient's disease, including the serologic abnormalities.[18,34–37](#core-r018) Indeed, at times HIV infection is difficult to distinguish from systemic lupus erythematosus, because patients with HIV infection may have autoantibodies, patients with lupus may have antibodies to HIV, and in rare cases systemic lupus erythematosus and HIV infection coexist. Rashes and nephritis can occur in patients with HIV infection. Retinitis with cotton-wool exudates is the usual form of ocular involvement, but secondary infection with cytomegalovirus, *T. pallidum,* mycobacteria, various fungi, or pseudomonas can affect any part of the eye.Could any other infectious diseases have had a role in this case?[16–21](#core-r016) The chronic otitis with drainage could have had an infectious origin. The patient had not been exposed to tuberculosis, and her chest film showed normal findings. The negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum* rules out syphilis as a cause. Infection with Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, or various fungi could conceivably have accounted for some or all of the findings.Finally, the possibility of a malignant tumor must be considered. Lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, malignant histiocytosis, leukemia, lymphomatoid granulomatosis,[9](#core-r009) angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions indicative of T-cell dysfunction, and neuroblastoma come to mind. All these disorders can cause fever and multisystem disease and can affect the eye, although the combination of scleritis and uveitis would be unusual. Chronic ear drainage such as this patient had often occurs in histiocytosis.[38](#core-r038)If I were this patient's physician, I would begin by ordering the appropriate serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus; the results of a test for antinuclear antibodies should be available within a day. If the test were positive, at a high titer, and no other serologic abnormalities were found, there would be no need to perform biopsies to establish a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. I would also request an ANCA test. To rule out a malignant tumor, I would examine a blood smear and consider a bone marrow biopsy and further imaging studies. With respect to infectious diseases, I would order a test for HIV antibodies and a CD4 cell count. I would also order appropriate tests for various infections and would ask an ophthalmologist about the wisdom of obtaining specimens from the eye for culture or serologic testing.I consider systemic lupus erythematosus the most likely diagnosis in this case, but Wegener's granulomatosis or other diseases may have been present. I cannot make a specific diagnosis without the results of laboratory tests for systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, and HIV infection.Dr. Paul A. Boepple: Our predominant concern initially was permanent loss of vision, so we administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic and antiviral agents. Infection was the first consideration in our differential diagnosis, and HIV infection was at the top of the list, with or without opportunistic infections.\n",

      "Dr. John L. Niles: I believe this case can best be characterized by two diagnoses, with two corresponding sets of diagnostic test results. One set consisted of serologic findings that supported the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:1280, with a homogeneous pattern. Antibodies to double-stranded DNA were present at a titer of 1:320. The complement values were low: the C3 level was 44 mg per deciliter, the C4 level was less than 10 mg per deciliter, and the total complement level was less than 3 U per milliliter. In addition, the test for antibodies to Sjögren's syndrome was positive, and serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a diffuse increase in immunoglobulins, with a normal distribution. These serologic findings, together with the malar rash, oral ulcers, and lymphopenia, are sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The low complement levels are typical of active systemic lupus erythematosus, with unusually severe ocular manifestations.Dr. Lisa H. Lerner: A superficial shave biopsy of the cheek showed focal parakeratosis and dermatitis with necrotic or dyskeratotic keratinocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. There was no thickening of the basement-membrane zone on routine or periodic acid–Schiff staining, and dermal interstitial mucin was not present. There was swelling and focal degeneration of endothelial cells in small dermal vessels, with a superficial perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltrate, but there were no fibrinoid deposits, which would have supported the diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The findings are consistent with but not diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus.Dr. Niles: The second set of serologic findings included a positive test for ANCA. Indirect immunofluorescence testing showed a perinuclear pattern of staining (p-ANCA), and a test for antibodies to myeloperoxidase was positive, at a titer of 108 units (normal value, less than 2.8). Tests for c-ANCA and for antibodies to proteinase 3 were negative. The presence of antibodies to either myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is highly specific for the group of related vasculitic syndromes that includes Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopical polyangiitis, the Churg–Strauss syndrome, and renal-limited, pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.[25,39–42](#core-r025) In the appropriate clinical setting, the finding of antibodies to myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is virtually diagnostic of this spectrum of disease.[43,44](#core-r043) Two of the most prominent clinical features of this case were the otitis and the ocular findings, which have been described in these diseases and which strongly support a diagnosis of vasculitis consistent with the presence of Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopical polyangiitis.The presence of antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA and hypocomplementemia are not typical features of Wegener's granulomatosis. Similarly, otitis and the presence of ANCA are not typical features of systemic lupus erythematosus. Clearly, the patient had features of both diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus may be associated with a variety of autoantibodies, including those to intracellular and cell-surface antigens, but antibodies to myeloperoxidase are rarely present.[26,45](#core-r026) Wegener's granulomatosis is usually associated with either p-ANCA or c-ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase, but not with other autoantibodies.Dr. Schaller: Only the p-ANCA test was positive in this patient. The test for c-ANCA, the type more often associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, was negative. These findings are also evidence against the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Niles: Twenty percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis have antibodies to myeloperoxidase,[42](#core-r042) and several autoantibodies, including those to myeloperoxidase, may produce the p-ANCA pattern. Among these autoantibodies, only antibodies to myeloperoxidase have been shown to be highly specific for the spectrum of vasculitic disorders that includes Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopical polyangiitis. Thus, although the finding of p-ANCA is not very useful diagnostically by itself, the combination of positive tests for p-ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase is very useful.When a patient has organ-threatening disease, as this patient had in her eye, aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is warranted, whether the disease is due to systemic lupus erythematosus or Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Schaller: From a rheumatologist's point of view, however, the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis differ. This girl needs very aggressive treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus, probably with a combination of drugs, and monitoring of the serum complement and double-stranded DNA antibody levels.Dr. Niles: I agree that monitoring the titers of serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus and ANCA titers will be very useful for the long-term management of her condition.Initially, the patient was treated with the intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone. Because of her age and strong desire to have more children, zidovudine (75 mg per day) was then given, with a slow tapering of prednisone to a low dose. Her condition improved considerably in the months after her hospitalization, with a marked increase in her vision. Her complement levels have become normal, and there has been a large decrease in her ANCA titer.\n",

      "Question: A 16-year-old girl presents with a 3-month history of intermittent fever, fatigue, anorexia with 14 kg weight loss, and a prior dermatomal vesicular rash on the left thigh. Two weeks prior to admission, she developed left ear drainage, followed by painful intraoral lesions and decreased vision in the right eye. Examination reveals a temperature of 39.2°C, pulse of 130, and blood pressure of 110/60 mm Hg. Ocular findings include marked swelling around the right orbit with severe chemosis, diffuse conjunctival infection, tenderness of the sclera, limited visual acuity in the right eye (finger counting at 0.6 m), a large right retinal detachment, minimal erythema of the left eye with slight scleral thickening (visual acuity 20/40), and greenish pus draining from a perforated left tympanic membrane. Oral examination reveals scattered ulcers covered by white exudate on the buccal mucosa and soft palate. Skin examination shows periungual telangiectases, palmar erythema, and hyperpigmented macular lesions on the left anterior thigh in an L2 dermatomal distribution. Laboratory findings include proteinuria (++), hematuria (5-10 RBCs/HPF), pyuria (10-20 WBCs/HPF), hyaline casts (10-20/LPF), a positive serologic test for syphilis (1:2) with a negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum*, a negative tuberculin skin test, and a CT scan showing preseptal swelling of the right eye with diffuse thickening and enhancement of the sclera, and opacified left mastoid air cells. Further testing reveals a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test at 1:1280 with a homogeneous pattern, positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies at 1:320, low C3 and C4 complement levels, positive anti-Sjögren's syndrome antibodies, and a positive perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) test with positive antibodies to myeloperoxidase.

       "{'original': {'question': \"A 16-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of fever, rash, and severe ocular disease.\\nThe patient had been in good health until three months earlier, when small, painful, mildly pruritic vesicles appeared on her left thigh. She was given oral and topical medications, and the rash disappeared within a few days, leaving hyperpigmented scars. Thereafter, she had intermittent fever, fatigue, and anorexia, with a weight loss of 14 kg.\\nTwo weeks before admission, the patient's left ear began to drain. Several days before admission, painful intraoral lesions appeared. One day before admission, clarithromycin was prescribed for recurrent drainage from the left ear, and vision in the right eye decreased markedly. An examination elsewhere showed scleritis and uveitis. Topical erythromycin was administered, and the patient was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient had been born in the United States to Cambodian parents. At the age of 14 years, the patient had given birth to a healthy daughter after an uncomplicated pregnancy. The hematocrit during her pregnancy was 36 percent. There was a history of mild varicella and sex with multiple partners. She had had an abnormal vaginal smear, but repeated smears during the year before admission were negative. She had received medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension intramuscularly for a year, followed by amenorrhea. She had recently noted hair loss. There was no history of tuberculosis or exposure to it or of travel to Cambodia.\\nThe temperature was 39.2°C, the pulse was 130, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\\nThe patient appeared acutely and chronically ill. Examination revealed marked swelling around the right orbit, with severe chemosis, diffuse conjunctival infection, and tenderness of the sclera on palpation. Visual acuity was limited, with an ability to discern the number of fingers held up at a maximal distance of 0.6 m, and extraocular movement was restricted laterally by the chemosis. There was a large right retinal detachment, probably exudative, involving the macula. There was minimal erythema of the left eye, with slight scleral thickening; the fundus appeared normal. Visual acuity was 20/40. Greenish pus issued from a perforation in the left tympanic membrane. The right ear was normal. A few scattered ulcers covered by white exudate were observed on the buccal mucosa and soft palate, and several petechiae were scattered on the soft palate. There was a small amount of exudate on the left tonsil. Examination of the skin showed a few periungual telangiectases, prominent palmar erythema, and hyperpigmented macular lesions on the left anterior thigh in a distribution resembling the L2 dermatome. Slightly atrophic erythematous plaques with silvery scales were present on each upper eyelid and in the right malar region. Shotty posterior cervical and right axillary lymph nodes and left inguinal lymph nodes, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, were palpable. A nonradiating, grade 2 systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border.\\nThe urine was positive (++) for protein. The sediment contained 5 to 10 red cells, 10 to 20 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power field; there were 10 to 20 hyaline casts per low-power field. Other laboratory tests were performed (\\nTable 1\\nand\\nTable 2\\n). A serologic test for syphilis was positive at a titer of 1:2, but a microhemagglutination test for\\nTreponema pallidum\\nwas negative. A tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) and skin tests with mumps and candida antigens were negative at 48 hours. Radiographs of the chest showed normal findings. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head (\\nFigure 1\\n), obtained after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed moderate preseptal swelling of the soft tissue of the right eye, with diffuse thickening and enhancement of the sclera — findings consistent with the presence of scleritis. The left eye appeared normal. The left mastoid air cells were opacified, with minimal sclerosis and prominent sulci.\\nSpecimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and gentamicin, ceftazidime, acyclovir, and methylprednisolone (40 mg daily) were given intravenously. A urine culture yielded rare gram-negative enteric rods, and a culture of drainage fluid from the left ear yielded\\nPseudomonas aeruginosa.\\nMultiple blood cultures were sterile. The temperature peaked daily at 39.3 to 40°C.\\nDiagnostic procedures were performed.\\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?\",\n",
       "  'reasoning': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Jane G. Schaller[\\\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic images?Dr. Robert T. Bramson: The CT scan ([Figure 1](#f01)) of the right eye shows marked thickening of the soft tissue within and around the globe. The frontal, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses appear normal, but the left mastoid air cells are sclerotic and filled with fluid. There is slight, generalized cerebral atrophy. There is no evidence of a space-occupying lesion.Dr. Schaller: Being a rheumatologist, I shall begin with a discussion of rheumatic diseases, although there are no test results that are clearly diagnostic of rheumatic disease in this case. It is crucial in cases of this type to consider specifically treatable diseases that can mimic rheumatic diseases, including infectious diseases, malignant tumors, and other conditions with traumatic or environmental causes. In the present case, the question of infectious disease, particularly varicella–zoster virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, looms large, and a malignant tumor is also possible.Could any one rheumatic disease explain all the findings in this case? Systemic lupus erythematosus could,[1](#core-r001) but we have no information about serum complement levels or important serologic tests, including those for antinuclear antibodies and for antibodies to double-stranded DNA and Sm, Ro, and La antigens. Although antinuclear-antibody–negative lupus has been reported,[2](#core-r002) two negative tests at a good laboratory effectively rule out systemic lupus erythematosus.The diagnostic criteria for lupus are shown in [Table 3](#t03). The malar rash in this patient, although puzzling as described, is consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. A skin biopsy can be helpful diagnostically, since a rash associated with lupus has a characteristic histopathological appearance, although one hesitates to perform a biopsy in highly visible regions, such as the face. The dermatomal vesicular rash that heralded this patient's illness and suggested the presence of varicella–zoster virus is also consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. Lupus-associated rashes may take many forms and may affect any part of the body. A similar vesicular rash with a dermatomal distribution has been described in a teenager with lupus.[3](#core-r003) The patient under discussion had painful intraoral lesions and a renal disorder, with urinary findings that were consistent with the presence of early lupus nephritis. The finding of cerebral atrophy on the CT scan in this case is consistent with the presence of lupus cerebritis.[4](#core-r004) The patient had a hematologic disorder with severe anemia and a positive Coombs' test; her reticulocytosis was only mild, possibly because of the severity of her illness. The description of the blood smear does not help clarify the cause of the anemia, but it does make thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or the hemolytic–uremic syndrome unlikely. The apparent absence of anemia during the patient's pregnancy makes thalassemia or another type of hereditary anemia unlikely. Her low serum iron levels and total iron-binding capacity are consistent with the presence of iron deficiency and chronic disease. The patient had lymphopenia on a differential count; as a criterion for the diagnosis of lupus, lymphopenia is defined as fewer than 1500 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter; her absolute lymphocyte count was 528 per cubic millimeter. She had a biologic false positive serologic test for syphilis, with a negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum.* It would be interesting to know the results of these tests at the time of her pregnancy two years earlier.Even in the absence of information about a test for antinuclear antibodies, this patient's disease appears to meet the diagnostic criteria for lupus. If a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative, however, I would consider lupus an unlikely diagnosis.Are the other clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis of lupus? The most striking component of the eye disease was scleritis. Among patients with rheumatic diseases, scleritis is seen most often in those with rheumatoid factor–positive rheumatoid arthritis[5](#core-r005) or Wegener's granulomatosis[5–9](#core-r005); it is occasionally seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus[10,11](#core-r010) or other conditions, including sarcoidosis, Behçet's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's syndrome, dermatomyositis, polyarteritis nodosa and other forms of vasculitis, and polychondritis.[5,6,9,12–15](#core-r005) This patient also had iridocyclitis and choroiditis, as well as a large right retinal detachment, which was probably related to the posterior scleritis. Many infections can cause scleritis,[16–21](#core-r016) including HIV infection, varicella–zoster virus, Lyme disease, syphilis, and tuberculosis.Other findings consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in this patient include the chronic course of the illness, fever, weight loss, malaise, alopecia, periungual telangiectasia, palmar erythema, shotty lymphadenopathy, and petechiae on the soft palate. Laboratory findings that are consistent with the diagnosis, in addition to those already mentioned, include the very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels, the elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, the very high level of ferritin (which may have been acting as an acute-phase reactant), and the elevated globulin fraction, with a reversal of the ratio of albumin to globulin. The slight hypocalcemia may be related to the low serum albumin level.Ear drainage is a nonspecific finding for systemic lupus erythematosus. The radiographs suggest the presence of a chronic process in the ear and mastoid that is unrelated to the current illness. In summary, nearly all the clinical and laboratory findings are consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.The findings in this case are also consistent with the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, although the disorder is rare in young people.[22,23](#core-r022) Features that suggest this diagnosis include the drainage from the ear, the oral ulcers, the abnormal results of urinalysis, the scleritis, and the debilitating nature of the chronic febrile illness. The criteria for the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis are shown in [Table 4](#t04).[24](#core-r024) This patient had oral ulcers. She had no nasal involvement, but she did have involvement of the ear, mastoid, and sinuses, which occurs in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. The findings on the chest radiograph were normal, but microhematuria was present. Although ocular involvement is not a diagnostic criterion, severe scleritis occurs in up to 16 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis.[5–9](#core-r005) Of most immediate interest diagnostically would be the results of a test for antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). The cytoplasmic type of ANCA (c-ANCA) is present in about 80 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and is characteristic of the disorder.[25,26](#core-r025) A few features of this case that are not suggestive of the diagnosis, however, are the facial rash, the positive Coombs' test, and the biologic false positive test for syphilis.Behçet's disease can cause oral ulcers and ocular disease ([Table 5](#t05)),[27](#core-r027) but the latter is most often manifested as uveitis, retinitis, or both[13](#core-r013); scleritis is rare. This patient did not have recurrent genital ulcers, a common feature of Behçet's disease. The rash resembling varicella–zoster was probably not the papulopustular lesion characteristic of Behçet's disease. Finally, Behçet's disease is not associated with hemolytic anemia or a biologic false positive test for syphilis, two findings reported in this case.Sarcoidosis[14,28](#core-r014) can cause uveitis, anergy on delayed-hypersensitivity testing, elevated liver-function values, renal involvement, and occasionally scleritis, although it is not the usual form of eye disease. However, the degree of anemia reported in this case is atypical of sarcoidosis. The angiotensin-converting–enzyme level was normal in this case, but it is elevated in only about 60 percent of cases of sarcoidosis. Chest involvement, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, arthritis, and erythema nodosum, which are common findings in cases of sarcoidosis, were absent in this case.Two types of spondyloarthropathy should also be mentioned.[15,29](#core-r015) Reiter's syndrome could account for the prolonged febrile illness, the oral ulcers, and even the urinary findings, but the eye disease associated with Reiter's syndrome is generally conjunctivitis, keratitis, or acute iritis, not scleritis. Furthermore, this patient had no musculoskeletal involvement, a hallmark of Reiter's syndrome. Inflammatory bowel disease, notably Crohn's disease, can present in young people without gastrointestinal symptoms. It can be associated with mouth sores and a prolonged febrile illness and can cause scleritis,[15](#core-r015) but the serologic findings in this case are not consistent with the presence of Crohn's disease.Polyarteritis is a diagnostic consideration, but it is usually not associated with a positive Coombs' test or a biologic false positive test for syphilis. Other rheumatic conditions that have been associated with scleritis include seropositive rheumatoid arthritis,[30](#core-r030) for which there is no clinical evidence in this case, and dermatomyositis,[31](#core-r031) which could explain the patient's facial and periungual rashes. Although she had no history of myalgia or muscle weakness, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels could be due to muscle disease rather than liver disease.It is very important to consider specifically treatable diseases, such as infectious diseases, before diagnosing a rheumatic disease, since treatments for rheumatic diseases are nonspecific and may mask the symptoms and signs of infectious diseases. Could an infectious disease explain all the findings in this case, or at least some of them, such as the ear drainage and the ocular disease? The negative blood cultures make bacterial sepsis unlikely.The patient probably also had herpes zoster, although only about 5 percent of cases occur before the age of 16 years.[32](#core-r032) In children with herpes zoster, a predisposing disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, an immunodeficiency disorder, or a malignant tumor should be considered. Varicella–zoster virus can cause ocular disease,[19](#core-r019) which is occasionally manifested as scleritis; it can involve the liver, with slightly elevated liver-function values, and can cause a prolonged febrile illness, particularly in a predisposed host. This girl had a history of chickenpox. There is evidence that chickenpox in infancy may be associated with zoster during later childhood,[33](#core-r033) but herpes zoster alone would not explain the positive Coombs' test, the severe anemia, or the false positive serologic test for syphilis. The administration of acyclovir on admission indicates that the patient's physicians also thought of varicella–zoster as either a cause of her illness or a factor contributing to it.Dr. Quan D. Nguyen: The initial lesions on the patient's face and around her right eye were herpetic. We were very concerned about the possibility of systemic herpetic infection and decided to administer intravenous acyclovir as part of the initial treatment.Dr. Schaller: HIV infection could cause all the features of this patient's disease, including the serologic abnormalities.[18,34–37](#core-r018) Indeed, at times HIV infection is difficult to distinguish from systemic lupus erythematosus, because patients with HIV infection may have autoantibodies, patients with lupus may have antibodies to HIV, and in rare cases systemic lupus erythematosus and HIV infection coexist. Rashes and nephritis can occur in patients with HIV infection. Retinitis with cotton-wool exudates is the usual form of ocular involvement, but secondary infection with cytomegalovirus, *T. pallidum,* mycobacteria, various fungi, or pseudomonas can affect any part of the eye.Could any other infectious diseases have had a role in this case?[16–21](#core-r016) The chronic otitis with drainage could have had an infectious origin. The patient had not been exposed to tuberculosis, and her chest film showed normal findings. The negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum* rules out syphilis as a cause. Infection with Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, or various fungi could conceivably have accounted for some or all of the findings.Finally, the possibility of a malignant tumor must be considered. Lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, malignant histiocytosis, leukemia, lymphomatoid granulomatosis,[9](#core-r009) angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions indicative of T-cell dysfunction, and neuroblastoma come to mind. All these disorders can cause fever and multisystem disease and can affect the eye, although the combination of scleritis and uveitis would be unusual. Chronic ear drainage such as this patient had often occurs in histiocytosis.[38](#core-r038)If I were this patient's physician, I would begin by ordering the appropriate serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus; the results of a test for antinuclear antibodies should be available within a day. If the test were positive, at a high titer, and no other serologic abnormalities were found, there would be no need to perform biopsies to establish a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. I would also request an ANCA test. To rule out a malignant tumor, I would examine a blood smear and consider a bone marrow biopsy and further imaging studies. With respect to infectious diseases, I would order a test for HIV antibodies and a CD4 cell count. I would also order appropriate tests for various infections and would ask an ophthalmologist about the wisdom of obtaining specimens from the eye for culture or serologic testing.I consider systemic lupus erythematosus the most likely diagnosis in this case, but Wegener's granulomatosis or other diseases may have been present. I cannot make a specific diagnosis without the results of laboratory tests for systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, and HIV infection.Dr. Paul A. Boepple: Our predominant concern initially was permanent loss of vision, so we administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic and antiviral agents. Infection was the first consideration in our differential diagnosis, and HIV infection was at the top of the list, with or without opportunistic infections.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. John L. Niles: I believe this case can best be characterized by two diagnoses, with two corresponding sets of diagnostic test results. One set consisted of serologic findings that supported the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:1280, with a homogeneous pattern. Antibodies to double-stranded DNA were present at a titer of 1:320. The complement values were low: the C3 level was 44 mg per deciliter, the C4 level was less than 10 mg per deciliter, and the total complement level was less than 3 U per milliliter. In addition, the test for antibodies to Sjögren's syndrome was positive, and serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a diffuse increase in immunoglobulins, with a normal distribution. These serologic findings, together with the malar rash, oral ulcers, and lymphopenia, are sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The low complement levels are typical of active systemic lupus erythematosus, with unusually severe ocular manifestations.Dr. Lisa H. Lerner: A superficial shave biopsy of the cheek showed focal parakeratosis and dermatitis with necrotic or dyskeratotic keratinocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. There was no thickening of the basement-membrane zone on routine or periodic acid–Schiff staining, and dermal interstitial mucin was not present. There was swelling and focal degeneration of endothelial cells in small dermal vessels, with a superficial perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltrate, but there were no fibrinoid deposits, which would have supported the diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The findings are consistent with but not diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus.Dr. Niles: The second set of serologic findings included a positive test for ANCA. Indirect immunofluorescence testing showed a perinuclear pattern of staining (p-ANCA), and a test for antibodies to myeloperoxidase was positive, at a titer of 108 units (normal value, less than 2.8). Tests for c-ANCA and for antibodies to proteinase 3 were negative. The presence of antibodies to either myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is highly specific for the group of related vasculitic syndromes that includes Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopical polyangiitis, the Churg–Strauss syndrome, and renal-limited, pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.[25,39–42](#core-r025) In the appropriate clinical setting, the finding of antibodies to myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is virtually diagnostic of this spectrum of disease.[43,44](#core-r043) Two of the most prominent clinical features of this case were the otitis and the ocular findings, which have been described in these diseases and which strongly support a diagnosis of vasculitis consistent with the presence of Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopical polyangiitis.The presence of antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA and hypocomplementemia are not typical features of Wegener's granulomatosis. Similarly, otitis and the presence of ANCA are not typical features of systemic lupus erythematosus. Clearly, the patient had features of both diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus may be associated with a variety of autoantibodies, including those to intracellular and cell-surface antigens, but antibodies to myeloperoxidase are rarely present.[26,45](#core-r026) Wegener's granulomatosis is usually associated with either p-ANCA or c-ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase, but not with other autoantibodies.Dr. Schaller: Only the p-ANCA test was positive in this patient. The test for c-ANCA, the type more often associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, was negative. These findings are also evidence against the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Niles: Twenty percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis have antibodies to myeloperoxidase,[42](#core-r042) and several autoantibodies, including those to myeloperoxidase, may produce the p-ANCA pattern. Among these autoantibodies, only antibodies to myeloperoxidase have been shown to be highly specific for the spectrum of vasculitic disorders that includes Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopical polyangiitis. Thus, although the finding of p-ANCA is not very useful diagnostically by itself, the combination of positive tests for p-ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase is very useful.When a patient has organ-threatening disease, as this patient had in her eye, aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is warranted, whether the disease is due to systemic lupus erythematosus or Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Schaller: From a rheumatologist's point of view, however, the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis differ. This girl needs very aggressive treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus, probably with a combination of drugs, and monitoring of the serum complement and double-stranded DNA antibody levels.Dr. Niles: I agree that monitoring the titers of serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus and ANCA titers will be very useful for the long-term management of her condition.Initially, the patient was treated with the intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone. Because of her age and strong desire to have more children, zidovudine (75 mg per day) was then given, with a slow tapering of prednisone to a low dose. Her condition improved considerably in the months after her hospitalization, with a marked increase in her vision. Her complement levels have become normal, and there has been a large decrease in her ANCA titer.\\n\",\n",

       "   'question': \"A 16-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of fever, rash, and severe ocular disease.\\nThe patient had been in good health until three months earlier, when small, painful, mildly pruritic vesicles appeared on her left thigh. She was given oral and topical medications, and the rash disappeared within a few days, leaving hyperpigmented scars. Thereafter, she had intermittent fever, fatigue, and anorexia, with a weight loss of 14 kg.\\nTwo weeks before admission, the patient's left ear began to drain. Several days before admission, painful intraoral lesions appeared. One day before admission, clarithromycin was prescribed for recurrent drainage from the left ear, and vision in the right eye decreased markedly. An examination elsewhere showed scleritis and uveitis. Topical erythromycin was administered, and the patient was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient had been born in the United States to Cambodian parents. At the age of 14 years, the patient had given birth to a healthy daughter after an uncomplicated pregnancy. The hematocrit during her pregnancy was 36 percent. There was a history of mild varicella and sex with multiple partners. She had had an abnormal vaginal smear, but repeated smears during the year before admission were negative. She had received medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension intramuscularly for a year, followed by amenorrhea. She had recently noted hair loss. There was no history of tuberculosis or exposure to it or of travel to Cambodia.\\nThe temperature was 39.2°C, the pulse was 130, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\\nThe patient appeared acutely and chronically ill. Examination revealed marked swelling around the right orbit, with severe chemosis, diffuse conjunctival infection, and tenderness of the sclera on palpation. Visual acuity was limited, with an ability to discern the number of fingers held up at a maximal distance of 0.6 m, and extraocular movement was restricted laterally by the chemosis. There was a large right retinal detachment, probably exudative, involving the macula. There was minimal erythema of the left eye, with slight scleral thickening; the fundus appeared normal. Visual acuity was 20/40. Greenish pus issued from a perforation in the left tympanic membrane. The right ear was normal. A few scattered ulcers covered by white exudate were observed on the buccal mucosa and soft palate, and several petechiae were scattered on the soft palate. There was a small amount of exudate on the left tonsil. Examination of the skin showed a few periungual telangiectases, prominent palmar erythema, and hyperpigmented macular lesions on the left anterior thigh in a distribution resembling the L2 dermatome. Slightly atrophic erythematous plaques with silvery scales were present on each upper eyelid and in the right malar region. Shotty posterior cervical and right axillary lymph nodes and left inguinal lymph nodes, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, were palpable. A nonradiating, grade 2 systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border.\\nThe urine was positive (++) for protein. The sediment contained 5 to 10 red cells, 10 to 20 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power field; there were 10 to 20 hyaline casts per low-power field. Other laboratory tests were performed (\\nTable 1\\nand\\nTable 2\\n). A serologic test for syphilis was positive at a titer of 1:2, but a microhemagglutination test for\\nTreponema pallidum\\nwas negative. A tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) and skin tests with mumps and candida antigens were negative at 48 hours. Radiographs of the chest showed normal findings. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head (\\nFigure 1\\n), obtained after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed moderate preseptal swelling of the soft tissue of the right eye, with diffuse thickening and enhancement of the sclera — findings consistent with the presence of scleritis. The left eye appeared normal. The left mastoid air cells were opacified, with minimal sclerosis and prominent sulci.\\nSpecimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and gentamicin, ceftazidime, acyclovir, and methylprednisolone (40 mg daily) were given intravenously. A urine culture yielded rare gram-negative enteric rods, and a culture of drainage fluid from the left ear yielded\\nPseudomonas aeruginosa.\\nMultiple blood cultures were sterile. The temperature peaked daily at 39.3 to 40°C.\\nDiagnostic procedures were performed.\\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?\",\n",
       "   'reasoning': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Jane G. Schaller[\\\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic images?Dr. Robert T. Bramson: The CT scan ([Figure 1](#f01)) of the right eye shows marked thickening of the soft tissue within and around the globe. The frontal, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses appear normal, but the left mastoid air cells are sclerotic and filled with fluid. There is slight, generalized cerebral atrophy. There is no evidence of a space-occupying lesion.Dr. Schaller: Being a rheumatologist, I shall begin with a discussion of rheumatic diseases, although there are no test results that are clearly diagnostic of rheumatic disease in this case. It is crucial in cases of this type to consider specifically treatable diseases that can mimic rheumatic diseases, including infectious diseases, malignant tumors, and other conditions with traumatic or environmental causes. In the present case, the question of infectious disease, particularly varicella–zoster virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, looms large, and a malignant tumor is also possible.Could any one rheumatic disease explain all the findings in this case? Systemic lupus erythematosus could,[1](#core-r001) but we have no information about serum complement levels or important serologic tests, including those for antinuclear antibodies and for antibodies to double-stranded DNA and Sm, Ro, and La antigens. Although antinuclear-antibody–negative lupus has been reported,[2](#core-r002) two negative tests at a good laboratory effectively rule out systemic lupus erythematosus.The diagnostic criteria for lupus are shown in [Table 3](#t03). The malar rash in this patient, although puzzling as described, is consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. A skin biopsy can be helpful diagnostically, since a rash associated with lupus has a characteristic histopathological appearance, although one hesitates to perform a biopsy in highly visible regions, such as the face. The dermatomal vesicular rash that heralded this patient's illness and suggested the presence of varicella–zoster virus is also consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. Lupus-associated rashes may take many forms and may affect any part of the body. A similar vesicular rash with a dermatomal distribution has been described in a teenager with lupus.[3](#core-r003) The patient under discussion had painful intraoral lesions and a renal disorder, with urinary findings that were consistent with the presence of early lupus nephritis. The finding of cerebral atrophy on the CT scan in this case is consistent with the presence of lupus cerebritis.[4](#core-r004) The patient had a hematologic disorder with severe anemia and a positive Coombs' test; her reticulocytosis was only mild, possibly because of the severity of her illness. The description of the blood smear does not help clarify the cause of the anemia, but it does make thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or the hemolytic–uremic syndrome unlikely. The apparent absence of anemia during the patient's pregnancy makes thalassemia or another type of hereditary anemia unlikely. Her low serum iron levels and total iron-binding capacity are consistent with the presence of iron deficiency and chronic disease. The patient had lymphopenia on a differential count; as a criterion for the diagnosis of lupus, lymphopenia is defined as fewer than 1500 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter; her absolute lymphocyte count was 528 per cubic millimeter. She had a biologic false positive serologic test for syphilis, with a negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum.* It would be interesting to know the results of these tests at the time of her pregnancy two years earlier.Even in the absence of information about a test for antinuclear antibodies, this patient's disease appears to meet the diagnostic criteria for lupus. If a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative, however, I would consider lupus an unlikely diagnosis.Are the other clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis of lupus? The most striking component of the eye disease was scleritis. Among patients with rheumatic diseases, scleritis is seen most often in those with rheumatoid factor–positive rheumatoid arthritis[5](#core-r005) or Wegener's granulomatosis[5–9](#core-r005); it is occasionally seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus[10,11](#core-r010) or other conditions, including sarcoidosis, Behçet's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's syndrome, dermatomyositis, polyarteritis nodosa and other forms of vasculitis, and polychondritis.[5,6,9,12–15](#core-r005) This patient also had iridocyclitis and choroiditis, as well as a large right retinal detachment, which was probably related to the posterior scleritis. Many infections can cause scleritis,[16–21](#core-r016) including HIV infection, varicella–zoster virus, Lyme disease, syphilis, and tuberculosis.Other findings consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in this patient include the chronic course of the illness, fever, weight loss, malaise, alopecia, periungual telangiectasia, palmar erythema, shotty lymphadenopathy, and petechiae on the soft palate. Laboratory findings that are consistent with the diagnosis, in addition to those already mentioned, include the very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels, the elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, the very high level of ferritin (which may have been acting as an acute-phase reactant), and the elevated globulin fraction, with a reversal of the ratio of albumin to globulin. The slight hypocalcemia may be related to the low serum albumin level.Ear drainage is a nonspecific finding for systemic lupus erythematosus. The radiographs suggest the presence of a chronic process in the ear and mastoid that is unrelated to the current illness. In summary, nearly all the clinical and laboratory findings are consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.The findings in this case are also consistent with the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, although the disorder is rare in young people.[22,23](#core-r022) Features that suggest this diagnosis include the drainage from the ear, the oral ulcers, the abnormal results of urinalysis, the scleritis, and the debilitating nature of the chronic febrile illness. The criteria for the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis are shown in [Table 4](#t04).[24](#core-r024) This patient had oral ulcers. She had no nasal involvement, but she did have involvement of the ear, mastoid, and sinuses, which occurs in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. The findings on the chest radiograph were normal, but microhematuria was present. Although ocular involvement is not a diagnostic criterion, severe scleritis occurs in up to 16 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis.[5–9](#core-r005) Of most immediate interest diagnostically would be the results of a test for antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). The cytoplasmic type of ANCA (c-ANCA) is present in about 80 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and is characteristic of the disorder.[25,26](#core-r025) A few features of this case that are not suggestive of the diagnosis, however, are the facial rash, the positive Coombs' test, and the biologic false positive test for syphilis.Behçet's disease can cause oral ulcers and ocular disease ([Table 5](#t05)),[27](#core-r027) but the latter is most often manifested as uveitis, retinitis, or both[13](#core-r013); scleritis is rare. This patient did not have recurrent genital ulcers, a common feature of Behçet's disease. The rash resembling varicella–zoster was probably not the papulopustular lesion characteristic of Behçet's disease. Finally, Behçet's disease is not associated with hemolytic anemia or a biologic false positive test for syphilis, two findings reported in this case.Sarcoidosis[14,28](#core-r014) can cause uveitis, anergy on delayed-hypersensitivity testing, elevated liver-function values, renal involvement, and occasionally scleritis, although it is not the usual form of eye disease. However, the degree of anemia reported in this case is atypical of sarcoidosis. The angiotensin-converting–enzyme level was normal in this case, but it is elevated in only about 60 percent of cases of sarcoidosis. Chest involvement, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, arthritis, and erythema nodosum, which are common findings in cases of sarcoidosis, were absent in this case.Two types of spondyloarthropathy should also be mentioned.[15,29](#core-r015) Reiter's syndrome could account for the prolonged febrile illness, the oral ulcers, and even the urinary findings, but the eye disease associated with Reiter's syndrome is generally conjunctivitis, keratitis, or acute iritis, not scleritis. Furthermore, this patient had no musculoskeletal involvement, a hallmark of Reiter's syndrome. Inflammatory bowel disease, notably Crohn's disease, can present in young people without gastrointestinal symptoms. It can be associated with mouth sores and a prolonged febrile illness and can cause scleritis,[15](#core-r015) but the serologic findings in this case are not consistent with the presence of Crohn's disease.Polyarteritis is a diagnostic consideration, but it is usually not associated with a positive Coombs' test or a biologic false positive test for syphilis. Other rheumatic conditions that have been associated with scleritis include seropositive rheumatoid arthritis,[30](#core-r030) for which there is no clinical evidence in this case, and dermatomyositis,[31](#core-r031) which could explain the patient's facial and periungual rashes. Although she had no history of myalgia or muscle weakness, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels could be due to muscle disease rather than liver disease.It is very important to consider specifically treatable diseases, such as infectious diseases, before diagnosing a rheumatic disease, since treatments for rheumatic diseases are nonspecific and may mask the symptoms and signs of infectious diseases. Could an infectious disease explain all the findings in this case, or at least some of them, such as the ear drainage and the ocular disease? The negative blood cultures make bacterial sepsis unlikely.The patient probably also had herpes zoster, although only about 5 percent of cases occur before the age of 16 years.[32](#core-r032) In children with herpes zoster, a predisposing disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, an immunodeficiency disorder, or a malignant tumor should be considered. Varicella–zoster virus can cause ocular disease,[19](#core-r019) which is occasionally manifested as scleritis; it can involve the liver, with slightly elevated liver-function values, and can cause a prolonged febrile illness, particularly in a predisposed host. This girl had a history of chickenpox. There is evidence that chickenpox in infancy may be associated with zoster during later childhood,[33](#core-r033) but herpes zoster alone would not explain the positive Coombs' test, the severe anemia, or the false positive serologic test for syphilis. The administration of acyclovir on admission indicates that the patient's physicians also thought of varicella–zoster as either a cause of her illness or a factor contributing to it.Dr. Quan D. Nguyen: The initial lesions on the patient's face and around her right eye were herpetic. We were very concerned about the possibility of systemic herpetic infection and decided to administer intravenous acyclovir as part of the initial treatment.Dr. Schaller: HIV infection could cause all the features of this patient's disease, including the serologic abnormalities.[18,34–37](#core-r018) Indeed, at times HIV infection is difficult to distinguish from systemic lupus erythematosus, because patients with HIV infection may have autoantibodies, patients with lupus may have antibodies to HIV, and in rare cases systemic lupus erythematosus and HIV infection coexist. Rashes and nephritis can occur in patients with HIV infection. Retinitis with cotton-wool exudates is the usual form of ocular involvement, but secondary infection with cytomegalovirus, *T. pallidum,* mycobacteria, various fungi, or pseudomonas can affect any part of the eye.Could any other infectious diseases have had a role in this case?[16–21](#core-r016) The chronic otitis with drainage could have had an infectious origin. The patient had not been exposed to tuberculosis, and her chest film showed normal findings. The negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum* rules out syphilis as a cause. Infection with Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, or various fungi could conceivably have accounted for some or all of the findings.Finally, the possibility of a malignant tumor must be considered. Lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, malignant histiocytosis, leukemia, lymphomatoid granulomatosis,[9](#core-r009) angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions indicative of T-cell dysfunction, and neuroblastoma come to mind. All these disorders can cause fever and multisystem disease and can affect the eye, although the combination of scleritis and uveitis would be unusual. Chronic ear drainage such as this patient had often occurs in histiocytosis.[38](#core-r038)If I were this patient's physician, I would begin by ordering the appropriate serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus; the results of a test for antinuclear antibodies should be available within a day. If the test were positive, at a high titer, and no other serologic abnormalities were found, there would be no need to perform biopsies to establish a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. I would also request an ANCA test. To rule out a malignant tumor, I would examine a blood smear and consider a bone marrow biopsy and further imaging studies. With respect to infectious diseases, I would order a test for HIV antibodies and a CD4 cell count. I would also order appropriate tests for various infections and would ask an ophthalmologist about the wisdom of obtaining specimens from the eye for culture or serologic testing.I consider systemic lupus erythematosus the most likely diagnosis in this case, but Wegener's granulomatosis or other diseases may have been present. I cannot make a specific diagnosis without the results of laboratory tests for systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, and HIV infection.Dr. Paul A. Boepple: Our predominant concern initially was permanent loss of vision, so we administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic and antiviral agents. Infection was the first consideration in our differential diagnosis, and HIV infection was at the top of the list, with or without opportunistic infections.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. John L. Niles: I believe this case can best be characterized by two diagnoses, with two corresponding sets of diagnostic test results. One set consisted of serologic findings that supported the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:1280, with a homogeneous pattern. Antibodies to double-stranded DNA were present at a titer of 1:320. The complement values were low: the C3 level was 44 mg per deciliter, the C4 level was less than 10 mg per deciliter, and the total complement level was less than 3 U per milliliter. In addition, the test for antibodies to Sjögren's syndrome was positive, and serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a diffuse increase in immunoglobulins, with a normal distribution. These serologic findings, together with the malar rash, oral ulcers, and lymphopenia, are sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The low complement levels are typical of active systemic lupus erythematosus, with unusually severe ocular manifestations.Dr. Lisa H. Lerner: A superficial shave biopsy of the cheek showed focal parakeratosis and dermatitis with necrotic or dyskeratotic keratinocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. There was no thickening of the basement-membrane zone on routine or periodic acid–Schiff staining, and dermal interstitial mucin was not present. There was swelling and focal degeneration of endothelial cells in small dermal vessels, with a superficial perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltrate, but there were no fibrinoid deposits, which would have supported the diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The findings are consistent with but not diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus.Dr. Niles: The second set of serologic findings included a positive test for ANCA. Indirect immunofluorescence testing showed a perinuclear pattern of staining (p-ANCA), and a test for antibodies to myeloperoxidase was positive, at a titer of 108 units (normal value, less than 2.8). Tests for c-ANCA and for antibodies to proteinase 3 were negative. The presence of antibodies to either myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is highly specific for the group of related vasculitic syndromes that includes Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopical polyangiitis, the Churg–Strauss syndrome, and renal-limited, pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.[25,39–42](#core-r025) In the appropriate clinical setting, the finding of antibodies to myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is virtually diagnostic of this spectrum of disease.[43,44](#core-r043) Two of the most prominent clinical features of this case were the otitis and the ocular findings, which have been described in these diseases and which strongly support a diagnosis of vasculitis consistent with the presence of Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopical polyangiitis.The presence of antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA and hypocomplementemia are not typical features of Wegener's granulomatosis. Similarly, otitis and the presence of ANCA are not typical features of systemic lupus erythematosus. Clearly, the patient had features of both diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus may be associated with a variety of autoantibodies, including those to intracellular and cell-surface antigens, but antibodies to myeloperoxidase are rarely present.[26,45](#core-r026) Wegener's granulomatosis is usually associated with either p-ANCA or c-ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase, but not with other autoantibodies.Dr. Schaller: Only the p-ANCA test was positive in this patient. The test for c-ANCA, the type more often associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, was negative. These findings are also evidence against the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Niles: Twenty percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis have antibodies to myeloperoxidase,[42](#core-r042) and several autoantibodies, including those to myeloperoxidase, may produce the p-ANCA pattern. Among these autoantibodies, only antibodies to myeloperoxidase have been shown to be highly specific for the spectrum of vasculitic disorders that includes Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopical polyangiitis. Thus, although the finding of p-ANCA is not very useful diagnostically by itself, the combination of positive tests for p-ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase is very useful.When a patient has organ-threatening disease, as this patient had in her eye, aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is warranted, whether the disease is due to systemic lupus erythematosus or Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Schaller: From a rheumatologist's point of view, however, the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis differ. This girl needs very aggressive treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus, probably with a combination of drugs, and monitoring of the serum complement and double-stranded DNA antibody levels.Dr. Niles: I agree that monitoring the titers of serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus and ANCA titers will be very useful for the long-term management of her condition.Initially, the patient was treated with the intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone. Because of her age and strong desire to have more children, zidovudine (75 mg per day) was then given, with a slow tapering of prednisone to a low dose. Her condition improved considerably in the months after her hospitalization, with a marked increase in her vision. Her complement levels have become normal, and there has been a large decrease in her ANCA titer.\\n\",\n",

       "   'question': \"A 16-year-old girl presents with a 3-month history of intermittent fever, fatigue, anorexia with 14 kg weight loss, and a prior dermatomal vesicular rash on the left thigh. Two weeks prior to admission, she developed left ear drainage, followed by painful intraoral lesions and decreased vision in the right eye. Examination reveals a temperature of 39.2°C, pulse of 130, and blood pressure of 110/60 mm Hg. Ocular findings include marked swelling around the right orbit with severe chemosis, diffuse conjunctival infection, tenderness of the sclera, limited visual acuity in the right eye (finger counting at 0.6 m), a large right retinal detachment, minimal erythema of the left eye with slight scleral thickening (visual acuity 20/40), and greenish pus draining from a perforated left tympanic membrane. Oral examination reveals scattered ulcers covered by white exudate on the buccal mucosa and soft palate. Skin examination shows periungual telangiectases, palmar erythema, and hyperpigmented macular lesions on the left anterior thigh in an L2 dermatomal distribution. Laboratory findings include proteinuria (++), hematuria (5-10 RBCs/HPF), pyuria (10-20 WBCs/HPF), hyaline casts (10-20/LPF), a positive serologic test for syphilis (1:2) with a negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum*, a negative tuberculin skin test, and a CT scan showing preseptal swelling of the right eye with diffuse thickening and enhancement of the sclera, and opacified left mastoid air cells. Further testing reveals a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test at 1:1280 with a homogeneous pattern, positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies at 1:320, low C3 and C4 complement levels, positive anti-Sjögren's syndrome antibodies, and a positive perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) test with positive antibodies to myeloperoxidase. Given these findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?\",\n",
       "   'reasoning': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Jane G. Schaller[\\\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic images?Dr. Robert T. Bramson: The CT scan ([Figure 1](#f01)) of the right eye shows marked thickening of the soft tissue within and around the globe. The frontal, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses appear normal, but the left mastoid air cells are sclerotic and filled with fluid. There is slight, generalized cerebral atrophy. There is no evidence of a space-occupying lesion.Dr. Schaller: Being a rheumatologist, I shall begin with a discussion of rheumatic diseases, although there are no test results that are clearly diagnostic of rheumatic disease in this case. It is crucial in cases of this type to consider specifically treatable diseases that can mimic rheumatic diseases, including infectious diseases, malignant tumors, and other conditions with traumatic or environmental causes. In the present case, the question of infectious disease, particularly varicella–zoster virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, looms large, and a malignant tumor is also possible.Could any one rheumatic disease explain all the findings in this case? Systemic lupus erythematosus could,[1](#core-r001) but we have no information about serum complement levels or important serologic tests, including those for antinuclear antibodies and for antibodies to double-stranded DNA and Sm, Ro, and La antigens. Although antinuclear-antibody–negative lupus has been reported,[2](#core-r002) two negative tests at a good laboratory effectively rule out systemic lupus erythematosus.The diagnostic criteria for lupus are shown in [Table 3](#t03). The malar rash in this patient, although puzzling as described, is consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. A skin biopsy can be helpful diagnostically, since a rash associated with lupus has a characteristic histopathological appearance, although one hesitates to perform a biopsy in highly visible regions, such as the face. The dermatomal vesicular rash that heralded this patient's illness and suggested the presence of varicella–zoster virus is also consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. Lupus-associated rashes may take many forms and may affect any part of the body. A similar vesicular rash with a dermatomal distribution has been described in a teenager with lupus.[3](#core-r003) The patient under discussion had painful intraoral lesions and a renal disorder, with urinary findings that were consistent with the presence of early lupus nephritis. The finding of cerebral atrophy on the CT scan in this case is consistent with the presence of lupus cerebritis.[4](#core-r004) The patient had a hematologic disorder with severe anemia and a positive Coombs' test; her reticulocytosis was only mild, possibly because of the severity of her illness. The description of the blood smear does not help clarify the cause of the anemia, but it does make thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or the hemolytic–uremic syndrome unlikely. The apparent absence of anemia during the patient's pregnancy makes thalassemia or another type of hereditary anemia unlikely. Her low serum iron levels and total iron-binding capacity are consistent with the presence of iron deficiency and chronic disease. The patient had lymphopenia on a differential count; as a criterion for the diagnosis of lupus, lymphopenia is defined as fewer than 1500 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter; her absolute lymphocyte count was 528 per cubic millimeter. She had a biologic false positive serologic test for syphilis, with a negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum.* It would be interesting to know the results of these tests at the time of her pregnancy two years earlier.Even in the absence of information about a test for antinuclear antibodies, this patient's disease appears to meet the diagnostic criteria for lupus. If a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative, however, I would consider lupus an unlikely diagnosis.Are the other clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis of lupus? The most striking component of the eye disease was scleritis. Among patients with rheumatic diseases, scleritis is seen most often in those with rheumatoid factor–positive rheumatoid arthritis[5](#core-r005) or Wegener's granulomatosis[5–9](#core-r005); it is occasionally seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus[10,11](#core-r010) or other conditions, including sarcoidosis, Behçet's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's syndrome, dermatomyositis, polyarteritis nodosa and other forms of vasculitis, and polychondritis.[5,6,9,12–15](#core-r005) This patient also had iridocyclitis and choroiditis, as well as a large right retinal detachment, which was probably related to the posterior scleritis. Many infections can cause scleritis,[16–21](#core-r016) including HIV infection, varicella–zoster virus, Lyme disease, syphilis, and tuberculosis.Other findings consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in this patient include the chronic course of the illness, fever, weight loss, malaise, alopecia, periungual telangiectasia, palmar erythema, shotty lymphadenopathy, and petechiae on the soft palate. Laboratory findings that are consistent with the diagnosis, in addition to those already mentioned, include the very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels, the elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, the very high level of ferritin (which may have been acting as an acute-phase reactant), and the elevated globulin fraction, with a reversal of the ratio of albumin to globulin. The slight hypocalcemia may be related to the low serum albumin level.Ear drainage is a nonspecific finding for systemic lupus erythematosus. The radiographs suggest the presence of a chronic process in the ear and mastoid that is unrelated to the current illness. In summary, nearly all the clinical and laboratory findings are consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.The findings in this case are also consistent with the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, although the disorder is rare in young people.[22,23](#core-r022) Features that suggest this diagnosis include the drainage from the ear, the oral ulcers, the abnormal results of urinalysis, the scleritis, and the debilitating nature of the chronic febrile illness. The criteria for the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis are shown in [Table 4](#t04).[24](#core-r024) This patient had oral ulcers. She had no nasal involvement, but she did have involvement of the ear, mastoid, and sinuses, which occurs in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. The findings on the chest radiograph were normal, but microhematuria was present. Although ocular involvement is not a diagnostic criterion, severe scleritis occurs in up to 16 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis.[5–9](#core-r005) Of most immediate interest diagnostically would be the results of a test for antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). The cytoplasmic type of ANCA (c-ANCA) is present in about 80 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and is characteristic of the disorder.[25,26](#core-r025) A few features of this case that are not suggestive of the diagnosis, however, are the facial rash, the positive Coombs' test, and the biologic false positive test for syphilis.Behçet's disease can cause oral ulcers and ocular disease ([Table 5](#t05)),[27](#core-r027) but the latter is most often manifested as uveitis, retinitis, or both[13](#core-r013); scleritis is rare. This patient did not have recurrent genital ulcers, a common feature of Behçet's disease. The rash resembling varicella–zoster was probably not the papulopustular lesion characteristic of Behçet's disease. Finally, Behçet's disease is not associated with hemolytic anemia or a biologic false positive test for syphilis, two findings reported in this case.Sarcoidosis[14,28](#core-r014) can cause uveitis, anergy on delayed-hypersensitivity testing, elevated liver-function values, renal involvement, and occasionally scleritis, although it is not the usual form of eye disease. However, the degree of anemia reported in this case is atypical of sarcoidosis. The angiotensin-converting–enzyme level was normal in this case, but it is elevated in only about 60 percent of cases of sarcoidosis. Chest involvement, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, arthritis, and erythema nodosum, which are common findings in cases of sarcoidosis, were absent in this case.Two types of spondyloarthropathy should also be mentioned.[15,29](#core-r015) Reiter's syndrome could account for the prolonged febrile illness, the oral ulcers, and even the urinary findings, but the eye disease associated with Reiter's syndrome is generally conjunctivitis, keratitis, or acute iritis, not scleritis. Furthermore, this patient had no musculoskeletal involvement, a hallmark of Reiter's syndrome. Inflammatory bowel disease, notably Crohn's disease, can present in young people without gastrointestinal symptoms. It can be associated with mouth sores and a prolonged febrile illness and can cause scleritis,[15](#core-r015) but the serologic findings in this case are not consistent with the presence of Crohn's disease.Polyarteritis is a diagnostic consideration, but it is usually not associated with a positive Coombs' test or a biologic false positive test for syphilis. Other rheumatic conditions that have been associated with scleritis include seropositive rheumatoid arthritis,[30](#core-r030) for which there is no clinical evidence in this case, and dermatomyositis,[31](#core-r031) which could explain the patient's facial and periungual rashes. Although she had no history of myalgia or muscle weakness, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels could be due to muscle disease rather than liver disease.It is very important to consider specifically treatable diseases, such as infectious diseases, before diagnosing a rheumatic disease, since treatments for rheumatic diseases are nonspecific and may mask the symptoms and signs of infectious diseases. Could an infectious disease explain all the findings in this case, or at least some of them, such as the ear drainage and the ocular disease? The negative blood cultures make bacterial sepsis unlikely.The patient probably also had herpes zoster, although only about 5 percent of cases occur before the age of 16 years.[32](#core-r032) In children with herpes zoster, a predisposing disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, an immunodeficiency disorder, or a malignant tumor should be considered. Varicella–zoster virus can cause ocular disease,[19](#core-r019) which is occasionally manifested as scleritis; it can involve the liver, with slightly elevated liver-function values, and can cause a prolonged febrile illness, particularly in a predisposed host. This girl had a history of chickenpox. There is evidence that chickenpox in infancy may be associated with zoster during later childhood,[33](#core-r033) but herpes zoster alone would not explain the positive Coombs' test, the severe anemia, or the false positive serologic test for syphilis. The administration of acyclovir on admission indicates that the patient's physicians also thought of varicella–zoster as either a cause of her illness or a factor contributing to it.Dr. Quan D. Nguyen: The initial lesions on the patient's face and around her right eye were herpetic. We were very concerned about the possibility of systemic herpetic infection and decided to administer intravenous acyclovir as part of the initial treatment.Dr. Schaller: HIV infection could cause all the features of this patient's disease, including the serologic abnormalities.[18,34–37](#core-r018) Indeed, at times HIV infection is difficult to distinguish from systemic lupus erythematosus, because patients with HIV infection may have autoantibodies, patients with lupus may have antibodies to HIV, and in rare cases systemic lupus erythematosus and HIV infection coexist. Rashes and nephritis can occur in patients with HIV infection. Retinitis with cotton-wool exudates is the usual form of ocular involvement, but secondary infection with cytomegalovirus, *T. pallidum,* mycobacteria, various fungi, or pseudomonas can affect any part of the eye.Could any other infectious diseases have had a role in this case?[16–21](#core-r016) The chronic otitis with drainage could have had an infectious origin. The patient had not been exposed to tuberculosis, and her chest film showed normal findings. The negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum* rules out syphilis as a cause. Infection with Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, or various fungi could conceivably have accounted for some or all of the findings.Finally, the possibility of a malignant tumor must be considered. Lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, malignant histiocytosis, leukemia, lymphomatoid granulomatosis,[9](#core-r009) angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions indicative of T-cell dysfunction, and neuroblastoma come to mind. All these disorders can cause fever and multisystem disease and can affect the eye, although the combination of scleritis and uveitis would be unusual. Chronic ear drainage such as this patient had often occurs in histiocytosis.[38](#core-r038)If I were this patient's physician, I would begin by ordering the appropriate serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus; the results of a test for antinuclear antibodies should be available within a day. If the test were positive, at a high titer, and no other serologic abnormalities were found, there would be no need to perform biopsies to establish a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. I would also request an ANCA test. To rule out a malignant tumor, I would examine a blood smear and consider a bone marrow biopsy and further imaging studies. With respect to infectious diseases, I would order a test for HIV antibodies and a CD4 cell count. I would also order appropriate tests for various infections and would ask an ophthalmologist about the wisdom of obtaining specimens from the eye for culture or serologic testing.I consider systemic lupus erythematosus the most likely diagnosis in this case, but Wegener's granulomatosis or other diseases may have been present. I cannot make a specific diagnosis without the results of laboratory tests for systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, and HIV infection.Dr. Paul A. Boepple: Our predominant concern initially was permanent loss of vision, so we administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic and antiviral agents. Infection was the first consideration in our differential diagnosis, and HIV infection was at the top of the list, with or without opportunistic infections.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. John L. Niles: I believe this case can best be characterized by two diagnoses, with two corresponding sets of diagnostic test results. One set consisted of serologic findings that supported the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:1280, with a homogeneous pattern. Antibodies to double-stranded DNA were present at a titer of 1:320. The complement values were low: the C3 level was 44 mg per deciliter, the C4 level was less than 10 mg per deciliter, and the total complement level was less than 3 U per milliliter. In addition, the test for antibodies to Sjögren's syndrome was positive, and serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a diffuse increase in immunoglobulins, with a normal distribution. These serologic findings, together with the malar rash, oral ulcers, and lymphopenia, are sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The low complement levels are typical of active systemic lupus erythematosus, with unusually severe ocular manifestations.Dr. Lisa H. Lerner: A superficial shave biopsy of the cheek showed focal parakeratosis and dermatitis with necrotic or dyskeratotic keratinocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. There was no thickening of the basement-membrane zone on routine or periodic acid–Schiff staining, and dermal interstitial mucin was not present. There was swelling and focal degeneration of endothelial cells in small dermal vessels, with a superficial perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltrate, but there were no fibrinoid deposits, which would have supported the diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The findings are consistent with but not diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus.Dr. Niles: The second set of serologic findings included a positive test for ANCA. Indirect immunofluorescence testing showed a perinuclear pattern of staining (p-ANCA), and a test for antibodies to myeloperoxidase was positive, at a titer of 108 units (normal value, less than 2.8). Tests for c-ANCA and for antibodies to proteinase 3 were negative. The presence of antibodies to either myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is highly specific for the group of related vasculitic syndromes that includes Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopical polyangiitis, the Churg–Strauss syndrome, and renal-limited, pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.[25,39–42](#core-r025) In the appropriate clinical setting, the finding of antibodies to myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is virtually diagnostic of this spectrum of disease.[43,44](#core-r043) Two of the most prominent clinical features of this case were the otitis and the ocular findings, which have been described in these diseases and which strongly support a diagnosis of vasculitis consistent with the presence of Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopical polyangiitis.The presence of antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA and hypocomplementemia are not typical features of Wegener's granulomatosis. Similarly, otitis and the presence of ANCA are not typical features of systemic lupus erythematosus. Clearly, the patient had features of both diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus may be associated with a variety of autoantibodies, including those to intracellular and cell-surface antigens, but antibodies to myeloperoxidase are rarely present.[26,45](#core-r026) Wegener's granulomatosis is usually associated with either p-ANCA or c-ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase, but not with other autoantibodies.Dr. Schaller: Only the p-ANCA test was positive in this patient. The test for c-ANCA, the type more often associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, was negative. These findings are also evidence against the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Niles: Twenty percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis have antibodies to myeloperoxidase,[42](#core-r042) and several autoantibodies, including those to myeloperoxidase, may produce the p-ANCA pattern. Among these autoantibodies, only antibodies to myeloperoxidase have been shown to be highly specific for the spectrum of vasculitic disorders that includes Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopical polyangiitis. Thus, although the finding of p-ANCA is not very useful diagnostically by itself, the combination of positive tests for p-ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase is very useful.When a patient has organ-threatening disease, as this patient had in her eye, aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is warranted, whether the disease is due to systemic lupus erythematosus or Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Schaller: From a rheumatologist's point of view, however, the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis differ. This girl needs very aggressive treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus, probably with a combination of drugs, and monitoring of the serum complement and double-stranded DNA antibody levels.Dr. Niles: I agree that monitoring the titers of serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus and ANCA titers will be very useful for the long-term management of her condition.Initially, the patient was treated with the intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone. Because of her age and strong desire to have more children, zidovudine (75 mg per day) was then given, with a slow tapering of prednisone to a low dose. Her condition improved considerably in the months after her hospitalization, with a marked increase in her vision. Her complement levels have become normal, and there has been a large decrease in her ANCA titer.\\n\",\n",
