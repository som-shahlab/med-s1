      "Dr. Richard B. Colletti[\\*](#FN1): I shall discuss the common causes of hematochezia, the difficulty of making a diagnosis in cases of bleeding of the small intestine, and the types of vascular lesions that often result in obscure bleeding.Anal fissure, a colonic polyp, and proctitis are common causes of childhood hematochezia, but they are readily detectable and rarely lead to anemia. Juvenile polyps, which typically cause painless hematochezia, can be diagnosed and removed by colonoscopic polypectomy.[1](#core-r001) Anemia accompanied by hematochezia suggests a Meckel's diverticulum, which according to the rule of twos, occurs in 2 percent of births, is 2 inches (5 cm) long and located 2 feet (60 cm) proximal to the ileocecal valve, and is 2 times more common in males than in females.[2](#core-r002) A radionuclide scan with pertechnetate is diagnostic in 95 percent of the cases in which ectopic gastric mucosa is present, and laparotomy confirms the diagnosis in the remainder. Inflammatory bowel disease is a common cause of hematochezia, but the associated abdominal pain and diarrhea were absent in this case.[3](#core-r003) Other indicators of inflammatory bowel disease, which were also absent, are radiographic evidence of mural thickening, a stricture, or a fistula of the small intestine; endoscopic evidence of mucosal granularity, ulceration, hemorrhage, or exudate; and a biopsy finding of disruption of the glandular architecture, infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes, or granulomas. The results of CT scanning and laparotomy rule out a bowel duplication as the cause of bleeding in this case.[4](#core-r004)The presence of hematochezia without hematemesis or blood in the gastric aspirate does not suggest a source of bleeding above the ligament of Treitz, although rapid, profuse, intermittent bleeding could have originated at any site distal to the pylorus. Esophageal varices and peptic ulcer disease caused by either *Helicobacter pylori* or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs would have been seen during endoscopy.[5](#core-r005) The clinical course is also inconsistent with intussusception, which typically causes severe colicky abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant in older children, without profuse bleeding. Schönlein–Henoch purpura, characterized by a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but skin lesions are generally present either at the onset of the illness or within six weeks thereafter, and purpura of the bowel may be detected by endoscopy.[6](#core-r006) There is also no evidence of either the hemolytic–uremic syndrome, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, uremia, and hemorrhagic colitis, or the Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which a factitious illness is reported or simulated by a parent.Bleeding from the biliary tree, which is rare in children, can be caused by trauma, a neoplasm, a gallstone, a hepatic aneurysm, an abscess, or a vascular lesion. Bleeding from the pancreas is even more rare. Hematobilia, however, typically causes upper gastrointestinal bleeding, often with biliary colic or jaundice, and hepatobiliary lesions are generally detectable by CT scanning or angiographic examination.Congenital hemangiomas of the bowel, either isolated or in the form of diffuse hemangiomatosis, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, usually in the first decade of life. Cutaneous lesions are often absent. Bowel hemangiomas may be very difficult to detect by endoscopic, radiographic, or CT examination but are generally seen at laparotomy. Patients with the Klippel–Trénaunay–Weber syndrome, which is characterized by cutaneous hemangiomas and limb hypertrophy, occasionally have bleeding from bowel lesions, particularly in the rectum. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, characterized by bluish cutaneous and gastrointestinal cavernous hemangiomas, is another rare but endoscopically detectable cause of bleeding.[7](#core-r007)Adolescents may have disorders that are more common in adults than in children, such as a hemorrhoid, a neoplasm, a diverticulum, or angiodysplasia. Hemorrhoidal thrombosis causes pain as well as bleeding but rarely causes anemia and is detectable on physical examination or by anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Neoplasms cause chronic occult bleeding more often than they cause hematochezia. In adults, diverticulosis and vascular ectasias account for more than 60 percent of major lower intestinal hemorrhages. Abrupt, painless, severe bleeding from diverticulosis originates most often in a large artery in the proximal colon and is detected by colonoscopy or angiography.[8](#core-r008)Other, less frequent causes of bleeding include a solitary rectal ulcer, colonic varices, mesenteric vascular insufficiency, and an aortoenteric fistula. Endometriosis of the bowel wall, particularly the rectum or distal ileum, can cause cyclic lower intestinal bleeding in reproductive-age females and is difficult to diagnose.[8](#core-r008) None of these disorders were apparent in this case, however, and the bleeding was not related to menses.The endoscopic and operative findings in this patient strongly suggest bleeding from the small intestine, the region of the bowel that is most difficult to study. Lesions in the small intestine often bleed slowly or intermittently, and its length, intraperitoneal location, vigorous contractility, and overlying loops hinder early diagnosis.[9](#core-r009) Contrast radiography of the small bowel, even with enteroclysis, detects obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in only 5 to 10 percent of cases. Radionuclide scanning of technetium-labeled red cells can be used to locate blood within the small bowel. Identifying the precise location of bleeding is difficult, however, and misleading information may result from the detection of pooled blood distal to the source of bleeding.[9,10](#core-r009)Angiography can detect bleeding at a rate as low as 0.5 ml per minute and can demonstrate massively bleeding lesions in the small and large bowel in over half the cases. When a bleeding lesion is identified, intraoperative injection of methylene-blue dye in a precisely positioned angiographic catheter can enable the surgeon to locate the source of hemorrhage and resect the shortest possible segment of small intestine.[11](#core-r011) A surgical exploration with palpation and transillumination of the small bowel but without other intraoperative techniques detects obscure causes of gastrointestinal bleeding, usually large vascular abnormalities or submucosal tumors, in only 10 percent of cases.[9,12](#core-r009)It is difficult to examine the small intestine endoscopically. A colonoscope can be used for upper endoscopic examination and advanced 40 to 60 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz by a technique called push enteroscopy. Specially designed enteroscopes can be pushed 80 to 120 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz. With sonde enteroscopy, the instrument has a balloon at the tip. When the balloon is propelled by peristalsis, it slowly traverses most of the small intestine, which can be viewed as the instrument is withdrawn.[13,14](#core-r013) Enteroscopy can identify obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in nearly 40 percent of cases. Intraoperative enteroscopy, in which a colonoscope is advanced to the proximal jejunum, where the surgeon aligns short segments of small bowel for visualization until the ileocecal valve is reached, is the most effective technique for endoscopic examination, with more than 80 percent of small-bowel lesions identified in this manner.[15,16](#core-r015) Potential complications include mucosal lacerations, perforation, and prolonged ileus. Rebleeding occurs in up to 45 percent of cases.The small intestine between the ligament of Treitz and the ileocecal valve is involved in only 3 to 5 percent of cases of major gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. Angiodysplasia accounts for 70 to 80 percent of cases of bleeding of the small intestine in adults; tumors, primarily leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas, account for 5 to 10 percent; and other vascular lesions account for less than 5 percent.[9](#core-r009)Angiodysplasia, characterized by a cluster of vessels, is found predominantly in the cecum and ascending colon in patients over the age of 60 years. The disorder is associated with aging, although it has been reported in young adults. In the early stages, the lesion consists of ectatic, distorted, thin-walled veins, venules, and capillaries in the submucosa, and it can progress to involve the mucosa. Enlarged arteries and thick-walled veins are seen in the advanced stage, which is less common. Routine histopathological examination detects fewer than a third of these lesions; special techniques, including the injection of colonic vessels with silicon rubber, are necessary to detect the remainder.[17](#core-r017)Angiodysplasia may also be difficult to detect by endoscopy, since other lesions, such as telangiectasia, colitis, and artifacts created by trauma or suction, may simulate it. Endoscopic visualization of angiodysplasia and other vascular lesions may be impaired by hypovolemia, which can be caused by bleeding or by the administration of meperidine during endoscopy. Angiographic examination can identify actively bleeding lesions, as well as some lesions that have stopped bleeding. Although angiographic examination often reveals colonic angiodysplasia, it rarely detects small-bowel angiodysplasia, which is diagnosed by either enteroscopy or intraoperative endoscopy.[9,18](#core-r009)In addition to hemangiomas, vascular lesions of the small intestine include arteriovenous malformations, connective-tissue disorders, and telangiectasia. Arteriovenous malformations, which contain thick-walled arteries and veins without capillaries, are congenital and occur in the young. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by degeneration of elastic fibers of the skin, eyes, and arteries, with thickening of the skin, angioid retinal streaks, and vascular occlusion. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur in children as young as five years of age, as a result of the rupture of dilated mucosal and submucosal veins and capillaries as well as arteries.[7,19](#core-r007) The Ehlers–Danlos syndrome can result in spontaneous arterial and intestinal rupture due to a defect in collagen synthesis, as well as hyperelasticity of the skin and joints and mitral-valve prolapse.[20](#core-r020)Telangiectasia (localized dilatation of capillaries and venules) in the small intestine can be associated with Turner's syndrome and can be a component of the CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In Turner's syndrome, telangiectasia has a predilection for the small bowel. Bleeding is uncommon, usually intermittent, and self-limited, but it can be severe and persistent.[21](#core-r021) Lesions may be detected by endoscopic examination but are found more often at laparotomy. The diagnosis is based on a 45,X karyotype and phenotypic features that include short stature, transient congenital lymphedema, widely spaced nipples, a webbed neck, cubitus valgus, and gonadal dysgenesis. Features of both the CREST syndrome and Turner's syndrome were absent in this child.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia comprises a group of autosomal dominant disorders of blood vessels of the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, and brain.[22](#core-r022) Early lesions are characterized by focal dilatations of postcapillary venules. When the disorder is fully developed, the venules are markedly dilated and convoluted, have no elastic fibers, and often communicate directly with dilated arterioles; true arteriovenous malformations are infrequent. The earliest sign of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is usually epistaxis, which is present in about half the patients by the age of 20 years; cutaneous telangiectasia is detectable in about half the patients by the age of 30 years. Approximately a quarter of the patients have visceral involvement, and in about 10 percent of those with visceral involvement, it precedes other manifestations.[23,24](#core-r023) Lesions may be found in the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, or colon, usually beginning in the fifth or sixth decade of life.[25](#core-r025) Bleeding may be severe, requiring many transfusions. Hepatic arteriovenous malformations can result in high-output cardiac failure.[26](#core-r026) In rare cases, a lesion of the ampulla of Vater causes bleeding.[27](#core-r027) In one series, 15 percent of the patients had gastrointestinal manifestations, beginning between the ages of 8 and 87 years, but less than 2 percent had such manifestations before the age of 30 years. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the initial manifestation in 1 percent of the patients. Recurrent bleeding was common and was fatal in some cases.[23](#core-r023)The typical endoscopic finding in patients with gastrointestinal hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is multiple, small, red, well-defined, flat nodules, often with stellate projections and an “anemic halo.” The lesions may resemble those of erosive gastritis or iatrogenic lesions of the mucosa. In a minority of the reported cases, there is no visible external lesion or family history of the disorder.[25,28](#core-r025)Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia rarely presents in childhood. It has been reported in a 10-month-old infant with gastric involvement and hematemesis.[29](#core-r029) In four children between one and five years of age, bleeding from colonic telangiectasia preceded the development of skin lesions or epistaxis.[30](#core-r030) A one-year-old infant presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatobiliary vascular anomalies.[31](#core-r031) Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has also been reported in a nine-year-old girl,[32](#core-r032) and there have been case reports of pulmonary, brain, and urinary tract complications during the first decade of life.The patient under discussion may have had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In the absence of neoplasia, inflammation, or ulceration of the small intestine, the source of the bleeding was probably a vascular lesion. No hemangioma, arteriovenous malformation, or angiodysplasia was apparent, and there were no signs of a connective-tissue disorder or Turner's syndrome. A family history of orocutaneous telangiectasia, recurrent bleeding, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemoptysis might have been revealing, as well as examination of first- and second-degree relatives for evidence of the disease. When the patient had hematuria in infancy, cystoscopy might have detected telangiectasia of the urinary bladder. The patient had no manifestations of biliary disease, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography could have been performed to determine whether the ampulla of Vater or biliary tree was involved.Microscopical examination of the resected jejunal lesion showed no abnormal vessels. However, it may be difficult to diagnose angiodysplasia, an arteriovenous malformation, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia on the basis of histologic studies. If the patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, at least one additional lesion must have continued to bleed postoperatively, either in the area of friable mucosa in the terminal ileum or at another site.If a lesion characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia had been found, what would the therapeutic options have been? Anecdotal reports and prospective studies suggest that treatment with an estrogen–progesterone combination can prevent or decrease bleeding in some cases.[33,34](#core-r033) Aminocaproic acid, a potent inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system, decreased the frequency of bleeding episodes in two patients, perhaps by enabling fibrin to seal the bleeding sites.[35](#core-r035) Those two patients had no abnormalities of platelet aggregation or factor VIII–von Willebrand factor complex, which have been reported in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Desmopressin was effective in one patient with massive gastrointestinal bleeding from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and reduced levels of von Willebrand factor who had not had a response to treatment with cryoprecipitate.[36](#core-r036) In this case, however, if bleeding that required multiple transfusions had continued, intraoperative endoscopy and either ablative therapy or resection would have been necessary. In conclusion, this patient probably had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia involving the small intestine.\n",

      "Dr. Carolyn C. Compton: The diagnostic procedure was a right-sided ileocolectomy. Examination of the specimen showed maroon-to-red mucosal blebs in the cecum and right colon ([Figure 1](#f01)). Microscopical examination of the blebs revealed blood-filled spaces that were part of an extensive plexus of thin-walled ectatic vessels, primarily involving the muscularis mucosae and superficial submucosa. Ectatic vessels traversed the muscularis mucosae, splitting its smooth-muscle fibers ([Figure 2](#f02)). These vessels had ruptured focally, with acute hemorrhage and sloughing of the overlying mucosa. Smaller vessels of identical appearance were also present focally in the muscularis propria.Immunohistochemical stains for factor VIII showed a single layer of endothelium lining the abnormal vessels ([Figure 3](#f03)). Trichrome staining confirmed the absence of smooth muscle in the vessel walls and the paucity of collagen in the perivascular connective tissue, and elastic-tissue staining showed an absence of elastic fibers ([Figure 4](#f04)). No vessels with abnormalities of the muscle layers, such as arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms, were identified. The telangiectatic lesions were characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or Osler–Weber–Rendu disease.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia occurs in all races, with an estimated frequency of 1 case per 2300 persons to 1 per 39,000, depending on the population studied.[22](#core-r022) Although the pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant, 20 percent of the patients do not have a family history of the disorder.[29](#core-r029) Approximately 10 percent of affected persons are asymptomatic and never report bleeding.[37](#core-r037)The vascular dysplasias encompassed by this disease include, in addition to telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, venous varicosities, arteriovenous fistulas, and aneurysms. The relative frequency of these lesions varies among affected families.The pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia has not yet been fully elucidated, but genetic studies have shown that it is a family of disorders caused by mutations in various genes.[22](#core-r022) Thus far, genetic linkages have been established at chromosome 9q33–q34 in some families[38,39](#core-r038) and at chromosome 12q in others.[40,41](#core-r040) A mutation of the gene for endoglin, the most abundant transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)–binding protein on endothelial-cell membranes, has been identified as a specific molecular abnormality in one form of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.[42](#core-r042) Current data suggest that the mutation of this gene, located at chromosome 9q3, results in either reduced production of normal protein or production of a protein that interferes with the normal function of endoglin. Presumably, with the loss of normal endoglin-binding function, endothelial-cell responses to TGF-β, including the migration, proliferation, adhesion, and production or organization of the extracellular matrix, are impaired, leading to vascular dysplasias.Dr. Harland S. Winter: Additional information became available after the diagnostic procedure had been performed. The child's maternal grandfather had epistaxis as a teenager and occasionally as an adult. An otolaryngologist identified telangiectasias in one of the grandfather's ears and in his nose and lower lip when he was 67 years old. Also, a maternal uncle had a history of recurrent nosebleeds, but examination of his nose by an otolaryngologist showed no abnormalities. Two of five maternal aunts had intermittent epistaxis, but neither has been evaluated by an otolaryngologist. None of the patient's first cousins have reported bleeding.Dr. Lewis B. Holmes: Several aspects of this child's story were instructive from the standpoint of a clinical geneticist. When she was hospitalized initially, there was no reported family history of disorders suggesting hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Later, we learned that one grandparent had had nosebleeds. The issue was finally resolved when an otolaryngologist who was familiar with the appearance of nasal telangiectases in this disease examined the potentially affected relatives. This experience underscores the importance of pursuing the family history carefully and consulting knowledgeable examiners. Haitjema et al.[43](#core-r043) have shown that many asymptomatic family members who may carry the gene for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can benefit from careful screening, since it often reveals clinically important, treatable lesions.The importance of the extra effort made to identify affected family members in this case is reminiscent of the experience with tuberous sclerosis, another autosomal dominant disorder in which the diagnosis is typically made first in the most severely affected child in the family. A cursory family history at that time may be negative. In one study,[44](#core-r044) careful screening of the parents of affected children, including examination for subtle skin lesions characteristic of tuberous sclerosis, CT scanning of the brain to detect tubers, and ultrasonography of the kidneys to detect angiomyolipomas, showed that 4 of 26 parents (15 percent) who initially had been considered unaffected had subtle signs of the disease.It is important for clinicians to help geneticists identify extended families in which several members have a genetic disorder and are willing to participate in genetic-linkage studies, which can be important for the family. The family physician can facilitate these studies, which usually require only venipuncture.Dr. Winter: After the diagnosis had been made, radiographic studies of the lungs and brain showed no vascular abnormalities. The patient continued to pass bright red blood rectally and to require blood transfusions. Because we suspected more extensive small-bowel or colonic involvement, we administered aminocaproic acid intravenously and subsequently switched to a dose of 3.75 g orally three times daily. She is currently taking 1.5 g of aminocaproic acid three times daily. Her hematocrit is 39 percent, and she has not had any clinical evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding for nine months.\n",

       "{'original': {'Question': \"A 14-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of recurrent rectal bleeding.\\nShe had been in excellent health until three years earlier, when she began to pass blood-tinged stools. The bleeding increased during the course of several days. A proctosigmoidoscopic examination showed no abnormality. Hydrocortisone enemas were followed by the cessation of bleeding. She was then well until 45 days before admission, when her stools again became blood-tinged, and she later passed frank blood rectally. A colonoscopic examination did not reveal the source of the bleeding. Hematochezia continued. Twenty-seven days before admission, the results of an esophagogastroduodenoscopic examination at another hospital were normal. A colonoscopic examination showed blood in the rectum and ascending colon, but the source was not identified. A radionuclide scan for Meckel's diverticulum was normal.\\nOne day later, the patient was transferred to this hospital. A physical examination was normal. Another radionuclide scan for Meckel's diverticulum and an upper gastrointestinal series with a small-bowel follow-through study were normal. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal on two occasions; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\\nTable 1\\n. The rectal bleeding diminished spontaneously, and the patient was discharged on the third hospital day with instructions to take ferrous sulfate. That evening, the rectal bleeding increased, and for several days she passed fresh blood rectally. She returned to this hospital 21 days before the current admission.\\nA physical examination was again normal, except for pallor. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal on two occasions; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\\nTable 1\\n. On the second hospital day, an exploratory laparotomy revealed evidence of blood in the small bowel and in the ascending, transverse, and descending colon. A Meckel's diverticulum was not detected. A hemorrhagic area, 1 cm by 1 cm, on the antimesenteric aspect of the midportion of the jejunum was excised. An intraoperative endoscopic examination, performed by telescoping the small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve over a sterile colonoscope, revealed a friable area of mucosa in the terminal ileum. Biopsy specimens were obtained. The liver appeared normal. An incidental appendectomy was performed. After the surgery, the patient passed stools with small blood clots. She was discharged on the ninth hospital day. Microscopical examination of the biopsy specimens obtained from the hemorrhagic area of the jejunum revealed acute submucosal hemorrhage without vascular abnormalities; the appendix and the biopsy specimens obtained from the terminal ileum were normal.\\nFour days after discharge, rectal bleeding recurred and worsened progressively. One day before admission, the hematocrit was 15 percent. Three units of packed red cells were transfused. Another colonoscopic examination was normal. On the following day, the patient was readmitted to the hospital.\\nShe had had hematuria during infancy, but an evaluation had not revealed the source of the bleeding. The episodes of bleeding had not been accompanied by pain or abdominal cramps, and there was no history of fever, diarrhea, constipation, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, easy bruising, orthostatic faintness, or syncope. Two younger siblings were well.\\nThe temperature was 37°C, the pulse was 108, and the respirations were 14. The blood pressure was 110/55 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was pale but appeared well nourished and appropriately developed for her age. No oral or cutaneous lesions were seen. The head, neck, lungs, and heart were normal, as were the abdomen and arms and legs.\\nPlatelet-aggregation studies were normal. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times and the values for urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolytes were normal; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\\nTable 1\\n. A mesenteric angiographic examination showed no evidence of an arteriovenous malformation or active extravasation of contrast material. There was normal hepatic branching from the celiac axis, and the splenic and portal veins were patent. A radionuclide scan for bleeding revealed normal activity in the liver, spleen, and great vessels, without evidence of hemorrhage, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was normal.\\nHematochezia persisted, and the hematocrit fell from 27.1 to 19.3 percent. Two additional units of packed red cells were transfused.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?\",\n",
       "  'Complex_CoT': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richard B. Colletti[\\\\*](#FN1): I shall discuss the common causes of hematochezia, the difficulty of making a diagnosis in cases of bleeding of the small intestine, and the types of vascular lesions that often result in obscure bleeding.Anal fissure, a colonic polyp, and proctitis are common causes of childhood hematochezia, but they are readily detectable and rarely lead to anemia. Juvenile polyps, which typically cause painless hematochezia, can be diagnosed and removed by colonoscopic polypectomy.[1](#core-r001) Anemia accompanied by hematochezia suggests a Meckel's diverticulum, which according to the rule of twos, occurs in 2 percent of births, is 2 inches (5 cm) long and located 2 feet (60 cm) proximal to the ileocecal valve, and is 2 times more common in males than in females.[2](#core-r002) A radionuclide scan with pertechnetate is diagnostic in 95 percent of the cases in which ectopic gastric mucosa is present, and laparotomy confirms the diagnosis in the remainder. Inflammatory bowel disease is a common cause of hematochezia, but the associated abdominal pain and diarrhea were absent in this case.[3](#core-r003) Other indicators of inflammatory bowel disease, which were also absent, are radiographic evidence of mural thickening, a stricture, or a fistula of the small intestine; endoscopic evidence of mucosal granularity, ulceration, hemorrhage, or exudate; and a biopsy finding of disruption of the glandular architecture, infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes, or granulomas. The results of CT scanning and laparotomy rule out a bowel duplication as the cause of bleeding in this case.[4](#core-r004)The presence of hematochezia without hematemesis or blood in the gastric aspirate does not suggest a source of bleeding above the ligament of Treitz, although rapid, profuse, intermittent bleeding could have originated at any site distal to the pylorus. Esophageal varices and peptic ulcer disease caused by either *Helicobacter pylori* or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs would have been seen during endoscopy.[5](#core-r005) The clinical course is also inconsistent with intussusception, which typically causes severe colicky abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant in older children, without profuse bleeding. Schönlein–Henoch purpura, characterized by a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but skin lesions are generally present either at the onset of the illness or within six weeks thereafter, and purpura of the bowel may be detected by endoscopy.[6](#core-r006) There is also no evidence of either the hemolytic–uremic syndrome, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, uremia, and hemorrhagic colitis, or the Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which a factitious illness is reported or simulated by a parent.Bleeding from the biliary tree, which is rare in children, can be caused by trauma, a neoplasm, a gallstone, a hepatic aneurysm, an abscess, or a vascular lesion. Bleeding from the pancreas is even more rare. Hematobilia, however, typically causes upper gastrointestinal bleeding, often with biliary colic or jaundice, and hepatobiliary lesions are generally detectable by CT scanning or angiographic examination.Congenital hemangiomas of the bowel, either isolated or in the form of diffuse hemangiomatosis, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, usually in the first decade of life. Cutaneous lesions are often absent. Bowel hemangiomas may be very difficult to detect by endoscopic, radiographic, or CT examination but are generally seen at laparotomy. Patients with the Klippel–Trénaunay–Weber syndrome, which is characterized by cutaneous hemangiomas and limb hypertrophy, occasionally have bleeding from bowel lesions, particularly in the rectum. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, characterized by bluish cutaneous and gastrointestinal cavernous hemangiomas, is another rare but endoscopically detectable cause of bleeding.[7](#core-r007)Adolescents may have disorders that are more common in adults than in children, such as a hemorrhoid, a neoplasm, a diverticulum, or angiodysplasia. Hemorrhoidal thrombosis causes pain as well as bleeding but rarely causes anemia and is detectable on physical examination or by anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Neoplasms cause chronic occult bleeding more often than they cause hematochezia. In adults, diverticulosis and vascular ectasias account for more than 60 percent of major lower intestinal hemorrhages. Abrupt, painless, severe bleeding from diverticulosis originates most often in a large artery in the proximal colon and is detected by colonoscopy or angiography.[8](#core-r008)Other, less frequent causes of bleeding include a solitary rectal ulcer, colonic varices, mesenteric vascular insufficiency, and an aortoenteric fistula. Endometriosis of the bowel wall, particularly the rectum or distal ileum, can cause cyclic lower intestinal bleeding in reproductive-age females and is difficult to diagnose.[8](#core-r008) None of these disorders were apparent in this case, however, and the bleeding was not related to menses.The endoscopic and operative findings in this patient strongly suggest bleeding from the small intestine, the region of the bowel that is most difficult to study. Lesions in the small intestine often bleed slowly or intermittently, and its length, intraperitoneal location, vigorous contractility, and overlying loops hinder early diagnosis.[9](#core-r009) Contrast radiography of the small bowel, even with enteroclysis, detects obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in only 5 to 10 percent of cases. Radionuclide scanning of technetium-labeled red cells can be used to locate blood within the small bowel. Identifying the precise location of bleeding is difficult, however, and misleading information may result from the detection of pooled blood distal to the source of bleeding.[9,10](#core-r009)Angiography can detect bleeding at a rate as low as 0.5 ml per minute and can demonstrate massively bleeding lesions in the small and large bowel in over half the cases. When a bleeding lesion is identified, intraoperative injection of methylene-blue dye in a precisely positioned angiographic catheter can enable the surgeon to locate the source of hemorrhage and resect the shortest possible segment of small intestine.[11](#core-r011) A surgical exploration with palpation and transillumination of the small bowel but without other intraoperative techniques detects obscure causes of gastrointestinal bleeding, usually large vascular abnormalities or submucosal tumors, in only 10 percent of cases.[9,12](#core-r009)It is difficult to examine the small intestine endoscopically. A colonoscope can be used for upper endoscopic examination and advanced 40 to 60 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz by a technique called push enteroscopy. Specially designed enteroscopes can be pushed 80 to 120 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz. With sonde enteroscopy, the instrument has a balloon at the tip. When the balloon is propelled by peristalsis, it slowly traverses most of the small intestine, which can be viewed as the instrument is withdrawn.[13,14](#core-r013) Enteroscopy can identify obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in nearly 40 percent of cases. Intraoperative enteroscopy, in which a colonoscope is advanced to the proximal jejunum, where the surgeon aligns short segments of small bowel for visualization until the ileocecal valve is reached, is the most effective technique for endoscopic examination, with more than 80 percent of small-bowel lesions identified in this manner.[15,16](#core-r015) Potential complications include mucosal lacerations, perforation, and prolonged ileus. Rebleeding occurs in up to 45 percent of cases.The small intestine between the ligament of Treitz and the ileocecal valve is involved in only 3 to 5 percent of cases of major gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. Angiodysplasia accounts for 70 to 80 percent of cases of bleeding of the small intestine in adults; tumors, primarily leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas, account for 5 to 10 percent; and other vascular lesions account for less than 5 percent.[9](#core-r009)Angiodysplasia, characterized by a cluster of vessels, is found predominantly in the cecum and ascending colon in patients over the age of 60 years. The disorder is associated with aging, although it has been reported in young adults. In the early stages, the lesion consists of ectatic, distorted, thin-walled veins, venules, and capillaries in the submucosa, and it can progress to involve the mucosa. Enlarged arteries and thick-walled veins are seen in the advanced stage, which is less common. Routine histopathological examination detects fewer than a third of these lesions; special techniques, including the injection of colonic vessels with silicon rubber, are necessary to detect the remainder.[17](#core-r017)Angiodysplasia may also be difficult to detect by endoscopy, since other lesions, such as telangiectasia, colitis, and artifacts created by trauma or suction, may simulate it. Endoscopic visualization of angiodysplasia and other vascular lesions may be impaired by hypovolemia, which can be caused by bleeding or by the administration of meperidine during endoscopy. Angiographic examination can identify actively bleeding lesions, as well as some lesions that have stopped bleeding. Although angiographic examination often reveals colonic angiodysplasia, it rarely detects small-bowel angiodysplasia, which is diagnosed by either enteroscopy or intraoperative endoscopy.[9,18](#core-r009)In addition to hemangiomas, vascular lesions of the small intestine include arteriovenous malformations, connective-tissue disorders, and telangiectasia. Arteriovenous malformations, which contain thick-walled arteries and veins without capillaries, are congenital and occur in the young. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by degeneration of elastic fibers of the skin, eyes, and arteries, with thickening of the skin, angioid retinal streaks, and vascular occlusion. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur in children as young as five years of age, as a result of the rupture of dilated mucosal and submucosal veins and capillaries as well as arteries.[7,19](#core-r007) The Ehlers–Danlos syndrome can result in spontaneous arterial and intestinal rupture due to a defect in collagen synthesis, as well as hyperelasticity of the skin and joints and mitral-valve prolapse.[20](#core-r020)Telangiectasia (localized dilatation of capillaries and venules) in the small intestine can be associated with Turner's syndrome and can be a component of the CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In Turner's syndrome, telangiectasia has a predilection for the small bowel. Bleeding is uncommon, usually intermittent, and self-limited, but it can be severe and persistent.[21](#core-r021) Lesions may be detected by endoscopic examination but are found more often at laparotomy. The diagnosis is based on a 45,X karyotype and phenotypic features that include short stature, transient congenital lymphedema, widely spaced nipples, a webbed neck, cubitus valgus, and gonadal dysgenesis. Features of both the CREST syndrome and Turner's syndrome were absent in this child.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia comprises a group of autosomal dominant disorders of blood vessels of the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, and brain.[22](#core-r022) Early lesions are characterized by focal dilatations of postcapillary venules. When the disorder is fully developed, the venules are markedly dilated and convoluted, have no elastic fibers, and often communicate directly with dilated arterioles; true arteriovenous malformations are infrequent. The earliest sign of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is usually epistaxis, which is present in about half the patients by the age of 20 years; cutaneous telangiectasia is detectable in about half the patients by the age of 30 years. Approximately a quarter of the patients have visceral involvement, and in about 10 percent of those with visceral involvement, it precedes other manifestations.[23,24](#core-r023) Lesions may be found in the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, or colon, usually beginning in the fifth or sixth decade of life.[25](#core-r025) Bleeding may be severe, requiring many transfusions. Hepatic arteriovenous malformations can result in high-output cardiac failure.[26](#core-r026) In rare cases, a lesion of the ampulla of Vater causes bleeding.[27](#core-r027) In one series, 15 percent of the patients had gastrointestinal manifestations, beginning between the ages of 8 and 87 years, but less than 2 percent had such manifestations before the age of 30 years. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the initial manifestation in 1 percent of the patients. Recurrent bleeding was common and was fatal in some cases.[23](#core-r023)The typical endoscopic finding in patients with gastrointestinal hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is multiple, small, red, well-defined, flat nodules, often with stellate projections and an “anemic halo.” The lesions may resemble those of erosive gastritis or iatrogenic lesions of the mucosa. In a minority of the reported cases, there is no visible external lesion or family history of the disorder.[25,28](#core-r025)Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia rarely presents in childhood. It has been reported in a 10-month-old infant with gastric involvement and hematemesis.[29](#core-r029) In four children between one and five years of age, bleeding from colonic telangiectasia preceded the development of skin lesions or epistaxis.[30](#core-r030) A one-year-old infant presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatobiliary vascular anomalies.[31](#core-r031) Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has also been reported in a nine-year-old girl,[32](#core-r032) and there have been case reports of pulmonary, brain, and urinary tract complications during the first decade of life.The patient under discussion may have had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In the absence of neoplasia, inflammation, or ulceration of the small intestine, the source of the bleeding was probably a vascular lesion. No hemangioma, arteriovenous malformation, or angiodysplasia was apparent, and there were no signs of a connective-tissue disorder or Turner's syndrome. A family history of orocutaneous telangiectasia, recurrent bleeding, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemoptysis might have been revealing, as well as examination of first- and second-degree relatives for evidence of the disease. When the patient had hematuria in infancy, cystoscopy might have detected telangiectasia of the urinary bladder. The patient had no manifestations of biliary disease, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography could have been performed to determine whether the ampulla of Vater or biliary tree was involved.Microscopical examination of the resected jejunal lesion showed no abnormal vessels. However, it may be difficult to diagnose angiodysplasia, an arteriovenous malformation, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia on the basis of histologic studies. If the patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, at least one additional lesion must have continued to bleed postoperatively, either in the area of friable mucosa in the terminal ileum or at another site.If a lesion characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia had been found, what would the therapeutic options have been? Anecdotal reports and prospective studies suggest that treatment with an estrogen–progesterone combination can prevent or decrease bleeding in some cases.[33,34](#core-r033) Aminocaproic acid, a potent inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system, decreased the frequency of bleeding episodes in two patients, perhaps by enabling fibrin to seal the bleeding sites.[35](#core-r035) Those two patients had no abnormalities of platelet aggregation or factor VIII–von Willebrand factor complex, which have been reported in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Desmopressin was effective in one patient with massive gastrointestinal bleeding from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and reduced levels of von Willebrand factor who had not had a response to treatment with cryoprecipitate.[36](#core-r036) In this case, however, if bleeding that required multiple transfusions had continued, intraoperative endoscopy and either ablative therapy or resection would have been necessary. In conclusion, this patient probably had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia involving the small intestine.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Carolyn C. Compton: The diagnostic procedure was a right-sided ileocolectomy. Examination of the specimen showed maroon-to-red mucosal blebs in the cecum and right colon ([Figure 1](#f01)). Microscopical examination of the blebs revealed blood-filled spaces that were part of an extensive plexus of thin-walled ectatic vessels, primarily involving the muscularis mucosae and superficial submucosa. Ectatic vessels traversed the muscularis mucosae, splitting its smooth-muscle fibers ([Figure 2](#f02)). These vessels had ruptured focally, with acute hemorrhage and sloughing of the overlying mucosa. Smaller vessels of identical appearance were also present focally in the muscularis propria.Immunohistochemical stains for factor VIII showed a single layer of endothelium lining the abnormal vessels ([Figure 3](#f03)). Trichrome staining confirmed the absence of smooth muscle in the vessel walls and the paucity of collagen in the perivascular connective tissue, and elastic-tissue staining showed an absence of elastic fibers ([Figure 4](#f04)). No vessels with abnormalities of the muscle layers, such as arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms, were identified. The telangiectatic lesions were characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or Osler–Weber–Rendu disease.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia occurs in all races, with an estimated frequency of 1 case per 2300 persons to 1 per 39,000, depending on the population studied.[22](#core-r022) Although the pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant, 20 percent of the patients do not have a family history of the disorder.[29](#core-r029) Approximately 10 percent of affected persons are asymptomatic and never report bleeding.[37](#core-r037)The vascular dysplasias encompassed by this disease include, in addition to telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, venous varicosities, arteriovenous fistulas, and aneurysms. The relative frequency of these lesions varies among affected families.The pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia has not yet been fully elucidated, but genetic studies have shown that it is a family of disorders caused by mutations in various genes.[22](#core-r022) Thus far, genetic linkages have been established at chromosome 9q33–q34 in some families[38,39](#core-r038) and at chromosome 12q in others.[40,41](#core-r040) A mutation of the gene for endoglin, the most abundant transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)–binding protein on endothelial-cell membranes, has been identified as a specific molecular abnormality in one form of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.[42](#core-r042) Current data suggest that the mutation of this gene, located at chromosome 9q3, results in either reduced production of normal protein or production of a protein that interferes with the normal function of endoglin. Presumably, with the loss of normal endoglin-binding function, endothelial-cell responses to TGF-β, including the migration, proliferation, adhesion, and production or organization of the extracellular matrix, are impaired, leading to vascular dysplasias.Dr. Harland S. Winter: Additional information became available after the diagnostic procedure had been performed. The child's maternal grandfather had epistaxis as a teenager and occasionally as an adult. An otolaryngologist identified telangiectasias in one of the grandfather's ears and in his nose and lower lip when he was 67 years old. Also, a maternal uncle had a history of recurrent nosebleeds, but examination of his nose by an otolaryngologist showed no abnormalities. Two of five maternal aunts had intermittent epistaxis, but neither has been evaluated by an otolaryngologist. None of the patient's first cousins have reported bleeding.Dr. Lewis B. Holmes: Several aspects of this child's story were instructive from the standpoint of a clinical geneticist. When she was hospitalized initially, there was no reported family history of disorders suggesting hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Later, we learned that one grandparent had had nosebleeds. The issue was finally resolved when an otolaryngologist who was familiar with the appearance of nasal telangiectases in this disease examined the potentially affected relatives. This experience underscores the importance of pursuing the family history carefully and consulting knowledgeable examiners. Haitjema et al.[43](#core-r043) have shown that many asymptomatic family members who may carry the gene for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can benefit from careful screening, since it often reveals clinically important, treatable lesions.The importance of the extra effort made to identify affected family members in this case is reminiscent of the experience with tuberous sclerosis, another autosomal dominant disorder in which the diagnosis is typically made first in the most severely affected child in the family. A cursory family history at that time may be negative. In one study,[44](#core-r044) careful screening of the parents of affected children, including examination for subtle skin lesions characteristic of tuberous sclerosis, CT scanning of the brain to detect tubers, and ultrasonography of the kidneys to detect angiomyolipomas, showed that 4 of 26 parents (15 percent) who initially had been considered unaffected had subtle signs of the disease.It is important for clinicians to help geneticists identify extended families in which several members have a genetic disorder and are willing to participate in genetic-linkage studies, which can be important for the family. The family physician can facilitate these studies, which usually require only venipuncture.Dr. Winter: After the diagnosis had been made, radiographic studies of the lungs and brain showed no vascular abnormalities. The patient continued to pass bright red blood rectally and to require blood transfusions. Because we suspected more extensive small-bowel or colonic involvement, we administered aminocaproic acid intravenously and subsequently switched to a dose of 3.75 g orally three times daily. She is currently taking 1.5 g of aminocaproic acid three times daily. Her hematocrit is 39 percent, and she has not had any clinical evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding for nine months.\\n\",\n",

      "Dr. Richard B. Colletti[\\*](#FN1): I shall discuss the common causes of hematochezia, the difficulty of making a diagnosis in cases of bleeding of the small intestine, and the types of vascular lesions that often result in obscure bleeding.Anal fissure, a colonic polyp, and proctitis are common causes of childhood hematochezia, but they are readily detectable and rarely lead to anemia. Juvenile polyps, which typically cause painless hematochezia, can be diagnosed and removed by colonoscopic polypectomy.[1](#core-r001) Anemia accompanied by hematochezia suggests a Meckel's diverticulum, which according to the rule of twos, occurs in 2 percent of births, is 2 inches (5 cm) long and located 2 feet (60 cm) proximal to the ileocecal valve, and is 2 times more common in males than in females.[2](#core-r002) A radionuclide scan with pertechnetate is diagnostic in 95 percent of the cases in which ectopic gastric mucosa is present, and laparotomy confirms the diagnosis in the remainder. Inflammatory bowel disease is a common cause of hematochezia, but the associated abdominal pain and diarrhea were absent in this case.[3](#core-r003) Other indicators of inflammatory bowel disease, which were also absent, are radiographic evidence of mural thickening, a stricture, or a fistula of the small intestine; endoscopic evidence of mucosal granularity, ulceration, hemorrhage, or exudate; and a biopsy finding of disruption of the glandular architecture, infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes, or granulomas. The results of CT scanning and laparotomy rule out a bowel duplication as the cause of bleeding in this case.[4](#core-r004)The presence of hematochezia without hematemesis or blood in the gastric aspirate does not suggest a source of bleeding above the ligament of Treitz, although rapid, profuse, intermittent bleeding could have originated at any site distal to the pylorus. Esophageal varices and peptic ulcer disease caused by either *Helicobacter pylori* or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs would have been seen during endoscopy.[5](#core-r005) The clinical course is also inconsistent with intussusception, which typically causes severe colicky abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant in older children, without profuse bleeding. Schönlein–Henoch purpura, characterized by a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but skin lesions are generally present either at the onset of the illness or within six weeks thereafter, and purpura of the bowel may be detected by endoscopy.[6](#core-r006) There is also no evidence of either the hemolytic–uremic syndrome, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, uremia, and hemorrhagic colitis, or the Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which a factitious illness is reported or simulated by a parent.Bleeding from the biliary tree, which is rare in children, can be caused by trauma, a neoplasm, a gallstone, a hepatic aneurysm, an abscess, or a vascular lesion. Bleeding from the pancreas is even more rare. Hematobilia, however, typically causes upper gastrointestinal bleeding, often with biliary colic or jaundice, and hepatobiliary lesions are generally detectable by CT scanning or angiographic examination.Congenital hemangiomas of the bowel, either isolated or in the form of diffuse hemangiomatosis, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, usually in the first decade of life. Cutaneous lesions are often absent. Bowel hemangiomas may be very difficult to detect by endoscopic, radiographic, or CT examination but are generally seen at laparotomy. Patients with the Klippel–Trénaunay–Weber syndrome, which is characterized by cutaneous hemangiomas and limb hypertrophy, occasionally have bleeding from bowel lesions, particularly in the rectum. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, characterized by bluish cutaneous and gastrointestinal cavernous hemangiomas, is another rare but endoscopically detectable cause of bleeding.[7](#core-r007)Adolescents may have disorders that are more common in adults than in children, such as a hemorrhoid, a neoplasm, a diverticulum, or angiodysplasia. Hemorrhoidal thrombosis causes pain as well as bleeding but rarely causes anemia and is detectable on physical examination or by anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Neoplasms cause chronic occult bleeding more often than they cause hematochezia. In adults, diverticulosis and vascular ectasias account for more than 60 percent of major lower intestinal hemorrhages. Abrupt, painless, severe bleeding from diverticulosis originates most often in a large artery in the proximal colon and is detected by colonoscopy or angiography.[8](#core-r008)Other, less frequent causes of bleeding include a solitary rectal ulcer, colonic varices, mesenteric vascular insufficiency, and an aortoenteric fistula. Endometriosis of the bowel wall, particularly the rectum or distal ileum, can cause cyclic lower intestinal bleeding in reproductive-age females and is difficult to diagnose.[8](#core-r008) None of these disorders were apparent in this case, however, and the bleeding was not related to menses.The endoscopic and operative findings in this patient strongly suggest bleeding from the small intestine, the region of the bowel that is most difficult to study. Lesions in the small intestine often bleed slowly or intermittently, and its length, intraperitoneal location, vigorous contractility, and overlying loops hinder early diagnosis.[9](#core-r009) Contrast radiography of the small bowel, even with enteroclysis, detects obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in only 5 to 10 percent of cases. Radionuclide scanning of technetium-labeled red cells can be used to locate blood within the small bowel. Identifying the precise location of bleeding is difficult, however, and misleading information may result from the detection of pooled blood distal to the source of bleeding.[9,10](#core-r009)Angiography can detect bleeding at a rate as low as 0.5 ml per minute and can demonstrate massively bleeding lesions in the small and large bowel in over half the cases. When a bleeding lesion is identified, intraoperative injection of methylene-blue dye in a precisely positioned angiographic catheter can enable the surgeon to locate the source of hemorrhage and resect the shortest possible segment of small intestine.[11](#core-r011) A surgical exploration with palpation and transillumination of the small bowel but without other intraoperative techniques detects obscure causes of gastrointestinal bleeding, usually large vascular abnormalities or submucosal tumors, in only 10 percent of cases.[9,12](#core-r009)It is difficult to examine the small intestine endoscopically. A colonoscope can be used for upper endoscopic examination and advanced 40 to 60 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz by a technique called push enteroscopy. Specially designed enteroscopes can be pushed 80 to 120 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz. With sonde enteroscopy, the instrument has a balloon at the tip. When the balloon is propelled by peristalsis, it slowly traverses most of the small intestine, which can be viewed as the instrument is withdrawn.[13,14](#core-r013) Enteroscopy can identify obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in nearly 40 percent of cases. Intraoperative enteroscopy, in which a colonoscope is advanced to the proximal jejunum, where the surgeon aligns short segments of small bowel for visualization until the ileocecal valve is reached, is the most effective technique for endoscopic examination, with more than 80 percent of small-bowel lesions identified in this manner.[15,16](#core-r015) Potential complications include mucosal lacerations, perforation, and prolonged ileus. Rebleeding occurs in up to 45 percent of cases.The small intestine between the ligament of Treitz and the ileocecal valve is involved in only 3 to 5 percent of cases of major gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. Angiodysplasia accounts for 70 to 80 percent of cases of bleeding of the small intestine in adults; tumors, primarily leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas, account for 5 to 10 percent; and other vascular lesions account for less than 5 percent.[9](#core-r009)Angiodysplasia, characterized by a cluster of vessels, is found predominantly in the cecum and ascending colon in patients over the age of 60 years. The disorder is associated with aging, although it has been reported in young adults. In the early stages, the lesion consists of ectatic, distorted, thin-walled veins, venules, and capillaries in the submucosa, and it can progress to involve the mucosa. Enlarged arteries and thick-walled veins are seen in the advanced stage, which is less common. Routine histopathological examination detects fewer than a third of these lesions; special techniques, including the injection of colonic vessels with silicon rubber, are necessary to detect the remainder.[17](#core-r017)Angiodysplasia may also be difficult to detect by endoscopy, since other lesions, such as telangiectasia, colitis, and artifacts created by trauma or suction, may simulate it. Endoscopic visualization of angiodysplasia and other vascular lesions may be impaired by hypovolemia, which can be caused by bleeding or by the administration of meperidine during endoscopy. Angiographic examination can identify actively bleeding lesions, as well as some lesions that have stopped bleeding. Although angiographic examination often reveals colonic angiodysplasia, it rarely detects small-bowel angiodysplasia, which is diagnosed by either enteroscopy or intraoperative endoscopy.[9,18](#core-r009)In addition to hemangiomas, vascular lesions of the small intestine include arteriovenous malformations, connective-tissue disorders, and telangiectasia. Arteriovenous malformations, which contain thick-walled arteries and veins without capillaries, are congenital and occur in the young. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by degeneration of elastic fibers of the skin, eyes, and arteries, with thickening of the skin, angioid retinal streaks, and vascular occlusion. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur in children as young as five years of age, as a result of the rupture of dilated mucosal and submucosal veins and capillaries as well as arteries.[7,19](#core-r007) The Ehlers–Danlos syndrome can result in spontaneous arterial and intestinal rupture due to a defect in collagen synthesis, as well as hyperelasticity of the skin and joints and mitral-valve prolapse.[20](#core-r020)Telangiectasia (localized dilatation of capillaries and venules) in the small intestine can be associated with Turner's syndrome and can be a component of the CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In Turner's syndrome, telangiectasia has a predilection for the small bowel. Bleeding is uncommon, usually intermittent, and self-limited, but it can be severe and persistent.[21](#core-r021) Lesions may be detected by endoscopic examination but are found more often at laparotomy. The diagnosis is based on a 45,X karyotype and phenotypic features that include short stature, transient congenital lymphedema, widely spaced nipples, a webbed neck, cubitus valgus, and gonadal dysgenesis. Features of both the CREST syndrome and Turner's syndrome were absent in this child.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia comprises a group of autosomal dominant disorders of blood vessels of the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, and brain.[22](#core-r022) Early lesions are characterized by focal dilatations of postcapillary venules. When the disorder is fully developed, the venules are markedly dilated and convoluted, have no elastic fibers, and often communicate directly with dilated arterioles; true arteriovenous malformations are infrequent. The earliest sign of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is usually epistaxis, which is present in about half the patients by the age of 20 years; cutaneous telangiectasia is detectable in about half the patients by the age of 30 years. Approximately a quarter of the patients have visceral involvement, and in about 10 percent of those with visceral involvement, it precedes other manifestations.[23,24](#core-r023) Lesions may be found in the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, or colon, usually beginning in the fifth or sixth decade of life.[25](#core-r025) Bleeding may be severe, requiring many transfusions. Hepatic arteriovenous malformations can result in high-output cardiac failure.[26](#core-r026) In rare cases, a lesion of the ampulla of Vater causes bleeding.[27](#core-r027) In one series, 15 percent of the patients had gastrointestinal manifestations, beginning between the ages of 8 and 87 years, but less than 2 percent had such manifestations before the age of 30 years. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the initial manifestation in 1 percent of the patients. Recurrent bleeding was common and was fatal in some cases.[23](#core-r023)The typical endoscopic finding in patients with gastrointestinal hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is multiple, small, red, well-defined, flat nodules, often with stellate projections and an “anemic halo.” The lesions may resemble those of erosive gastritis or iatrogenic lesions of the mucosa. In a minority of the reported cases, there is no visible external lesion or family history of the disorder.[25,28](#core-r025)Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia rarely presents in childhood. It has been reported in a 10-month-old infant with gastric involvement and hematemesis.[29](#core-r029) In four children between one and five years of age, bleeding from colonic telangiectasia preceded the development of skin lesions or epistaxis.[30](#core-r030) A one-year-old infant presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatobiliary vascular anomalies.[31](#core-r031) Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has also been reported in a nine-year-old girl,[32](#core-r032) and there have been case reports of pulmonary, brain, and urinary tract complications during the first decade of life.The patient under discussion may have had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In the absence of neoplasia, inflammation, or ulceration of the small intestine, the source of the bleeding was probably a vascular lesion. No hemangioma, arteriovenous malformation, or angiodysplasia was apparent, and there were no signs of a connective-tissue disorder or Turner's syndrome. A family history of orocutaneous telangiectasia, recurrent bleeding, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemoptysis might have been revealing, as well as examination of first- and second-degree relatives for evidence of the disease. When the patient had hematuria in infancy, cystoscopy might have detected telangiectasia of the urinary bladder. The patient had no manifestations of biliary disease, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography could have been performed to determine whether the ampulla of Vater or biliary tree was involved.Microscopical examination of the resected jejunal lesion showed no abnormal vessels. However, it may be difficult to diagnose angiodysplasia, an arteriovenous malformation, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia on the basis of histologic studies. If the patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, at least one additional lesion must have continued to bleed postoperatively, either in the area of friable mucosa in the terminal ileum or at another site.If a lesion characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia had been found, what would the therapeutic options have been? Anecdotal reports and prospective studies suggest that treatment with an estrogen–progesterone combination can prevent or decrease bleeding in some cases.[33,34](#core-r033) Aminocaproic acid, a potent inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system, decreased the frequency of bleeding episodes in two patients, perhaps by enabling fibrin to seal the bleeding sites.[35](#core-r035) Those two patients had no abnormalities of platelet aggregation or factor VIII–von Willebrand factor complex, which have been reported in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Desmopressin was effective in one patient with massive gastrointestinal bleeding from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and reduced levels of von Willebrand factor who had not had a response to treatment with cryoprecipitate.[36](#core-r036) In this case, however, if bleeding that required multiple transfusions had continued, intraoperative endoscopy and either ablative therapy or resection would have been necessary. In conclusion, this patient probably had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia involving the small intestine.\n",

      "Dr. Carolyn C. Compton: The diagnostic procedure was a right-sided ileocolectomy. Examination of the specimen showed maroon-to-red mucosal blebs in the cecum and right colon ([Figure 1](#f01)). Microscopical examination of the blebs revealed blood-filled spaces that were part of an extensive plexus of thin-walled ectatic vessels, primarily involving the muscularis mucosae and superficial submucosa. Ectatic vessels traversed the muscularis mucosae, splitting its smooth-muscle fibers ([Figure 2](#f02)). These vessels had ruptured focally, with acute hemorrhage and sloughing of the overlying mucosa. Smaller vessels of identical appearance were also present focally in the muscularis propria.Immunohistochemical stains for factor VIII showed a single layer of endothelium lining the abnormal vessels ([Figure 3](#f03)). Trichrome staining confirmed the absence of smooth muscle in the vessel walls and the paucity of collagen in the perivascular connective tissue, and elastic-tissue staining showed an absence of elastic fibers ([Figure 4](#f04)). No vessels with abnormalities of the muscle layers, such as arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms, were identified. The telangiectatic lesions were characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or Osler–Weber–Rendu disease.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia occurs in all races, with an estimated frequency of 1 case per 2300 persons to 1 per 39,000, depending on the population studied.[22](#core-r022) Although the pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant, 20 percent of the patients do not have a family history of the disorder.[29](#core-r029) Approximately 10 percent of affected persons are asymptomatic and never report bleeding.[37](#core-r037)The vascular dysplasias encompassed by this disease include, in addition to telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, venous varicosities, arteriovenous fistulas, and aneurysms. The relative frequency of these lesions varies among affected families.The pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia has not yet been fully elucidated, but genetic studies have shown that it is a family of disorders caused by mutations in various genes.[22](#core-r022) Thus far, genetic linkages have been established at chromosome 9q33–q34 in some families[38,39](#core-r038) and at chromosome 12q in others.[40,41](#core-r040) A mutation of the gene for endoglin, the most abundant transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)–binding protein on endothelial-cell membranes, has been identified as a specific molecular abnormality in one form of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.[42](#core-r042) Current data suggest that the mutation of this gene, located at chromosome 9q3, results in either reduced production of normal protein or production of a protein that interferes with the normal function of endoglin. Presumably, with the loss of normal endoglin-binding function, endothelial-cell responses to TGF-β, including the migration, proliferation, adhesion, and production or organization of the extracellular matrix, are impaired, leading to vascular dysplasias.Dr. Harland S. Winter: Additional information became available after the diagnostic procedure had been performed. The child's maternal grandfather had epistaxis as a teenager and occasionally as an adult. An otolaryngologist identified telangiectasias in one of the grandfather's ears and in his nose and lower lip when he was 67 years old. Also, a maternal uncle had a history of recurrent nosebleeds, but examination of his nose by an otolaryngologist showed no abnormalities. Two of five maternal aunts had intermittent epistaxis, but neither has been evaluated by an otolaryngologist. None of the patient's first cousins have reported bleeding.Dr. Lewis B. Holmes: Several aspects of this child's story were instructive from the standpoint of a clinical geneticist. When she was hospitalized initially, there was no reported family history of disorders suggesting hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Later, we learned that one grandparent had had nosebleeds. The issue was finally resolved when an otolaryngologist who was familiar with the appearance of nasal telangiectases in this disease examined the potentially affected relatives. This experience underscores the importance of pursuing the family history carefully and consulting knowledgeable examiners. Haitjema et al.[43](#core-r043) have shown that many asymptomatic family members who may carry the gene for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can benefit from careful screening, since it often reveals clinically important, treatable lesions.The importance of the extra effort made to identify affected family members in this case is reminiscent of the experience with tuberous sclerosis, another autosomal dominant disorder in which the diagnosis is typically made first in the most severely affected child in the family. A cursory family history at that time may be negative. In one study,[44](#core-r044) careful screening of the parents of affected children, including examination for subtle skin lesions characteristic of tuberous sclerosis, CT scanning of the brain to detect tubers, and ultrasonography of the kidneys to detect angiomyolipomas, showed that 4 of 26 parents (15 percent) who initially had been considered unaffected had subtle signs of the disease.It is important for clinicians to help geneticists identify extended families in which several members have a genetic disorder and are willing to participate in genetic-linkage studies, which can be important for the family. The family physician can facilitate these studies, which usually require only venipuncture.Dr. Winter: After the diagnosis had been made, radiographic studies of the lungs and brain showed no vascular abnormalities. The patient continued to pass bright red blood rectally and to require blood transfusions. Because we suspected more extensive small-bowel or colonic involvement, we administered aminocaproic acid intravenously and subsequently switched to a dose of 3.75 g orally three times daily. She is currently taking 1.5 g of aminocaproic acid three times daily. Her hematocrit is 39 percent, and she has not had any clinical evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding for nine months.\n",

      "In adolescents, we need to consider hemorrhoids, neoplasms, diverticula, and angiodysplasia. Hemorrhoids are usually painful and detectable on examination. Neoplasms usually cause occult bleeding. Diverticulosis and vascular ectasias are more common in adults.\n",

       "{'original': {'Question': \"A 14-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of recurrent rectal bleeding.\\nShe had been in excellent health until three years earlier, when she began to pass blood-tinged stools. The bleeding increased during the course of several days. A proctosigmoidoscopic examination showed no abnormality. Hydrocortisone enemas were followed by the cessation of bleeding. She was then well until 45 days before admission, when her stools again became blood-tinged, and she later passed frank blood rectally. A colonoscopic examination did not reveal the source of the bleeding. Hematochezia continued. Twenty-seven days before admission, the results of an esophagogastroduodenoscopic examination at another hospital were normal. A colonoscopic examination showed blood in the rectum and ascending colon, but the source was not identified. A radionuclide scan for Meckel's diverticulum was normal.\\nOne day later, the patient was transferred to this hospital. A physical examination was normal. Another radionuclide scan for Meckel's diverticulum and an upper gastrointestinal series with a small-bowel follow-through study were normal. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal on two occasions; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\\nTable 1\\n. The rectal bleeding diminished spontaneously, and the patient was discharged on the third hospital day with instructions to take ferrous sulfate. That evening, the rectal bleeding increased, and for several days she passed fresh blood rectally. She returned to this hospital 21 days before the current admission.\\nA physical examination was again normal, except for pallor. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal on two occasions; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\\nTable 1\\n. On the second hospital day, an exploratory laparotomy revealed evidence of blood in the small bowel and in the ascending, transverse, and descending colon. A Meckel's diverticulum was not detected. A hemorrhagic area, 1 cm by 1 cm, on the antimesenteric aspect of the midportion of the jejunum was excised. An intraoperative endoscopic examination, performed by telescoping the small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve over a sterile colonoscope, revealed a friable area of mucosa in the terminal ileum. Biopsy specimens were obtained. The liver appeared normal. An incidental appendectomy was performed. After the surgery, the patient passed stools with small blood clots. She was discharged on the ninth hospital day. Microscopical examination of the biopsy specimens obtained from the hemorrhagic area of the jejunum revealed acute submucosal hemorrhage without vascular abnormalities; the appendix and the biopsy specimens obtained from the terminal ileum were normal.\\nFour days after discharge, rectal bleeding recurred and worsened progressively. One day before admission, the hematocrit was 15 percent. Three units of packed red cells were transfused. Another colonoscopic examination was normal. On the following day, the patient was readmitted to the hospital.\\nShe had had hematuria during infancy, but an evaluation had not revealed the source of the bleeding. The episodes of bleeding had not been accompanied by pain or abdominal cramps, and there was no history of fever, diarrhea, constipation, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, easy bruising, orthostatic faintness, or syncope. Two younger siblings were well.\\nThe temperature was 37°C, the pulse was 108, and the respirations were 14. The blood pressure was 110/55 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was pale but appeared well nourished and appropriately developed for her age. No oral or cutaneous lesions were seen. The head, neck, lungs, and heart were normal, as were the abdomen and arms and legs.\\nPlatelet-aggregation studies were normal. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times and the values for urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolytes were normal; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in\\nTable 1\\n. A mesenteric angiographic examination showed no evidence of an arteriovenous malformation or active extravasation of contrast material. There was normal hepatic branching from the celiac axis, and the splenic and portal veins were patent. A radionuclide scan for bleeding revealed normal activity in the liver, spleen, and great vessels, without evidence of hemorrhage, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was normal.\\nHematochezia persisted, and the hematocrit fell from 27.1 to 19.3 percent. Two additional units of packed red cells were transfused.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?\",\n",
       "  'Complex_CoT': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richard B. Colletti[\\\\*](#FN1): I shall discuss the common causes of hematochezia, the difficulty of making a diagnosis in cases of bleeding of the small intestine, and the types of vascular lesions that often result in obscure bleeding.Anal fissure, a colonic polyp, and proctitis are common causes of childhood hematochezia, but they are readily detectable and rarely lead to anemia. Juvenile polyps, which typically cause painless hematochezia, can be diagnosed and removed by colonoscopic polypectomy.[1](#core-r001) Anemia accompanied by hematochezia suggests a Meckel's diverticulum, which according to the rule of twos, occurs in 2 percent of births, is 2 inches (5 cm) long and located 2 feet (60 cm) proximal to the ileocecal valve, and is 2 times more common in males than in females.[2](#core-r002) A radionuclide scan with pertechnetate is diagnostic in 95 percent of the cases in which ectopic gastric mucosa is present, and laparotomy confirms the diagnosis in the remainder. Inflammatory bowel disease is a common cause of hematochezia, but the associated abdominal pain and diarrhea were absent in this case.[3](#core-r003) Other indicators of inflammatory bowel disease, which were also absent, are radiographic evidence of mural thickening, a stricture, or a fistula of the small intestine; endoscopic evidence of mucosal granularity, ulceration, hemorrhage, or exudate; and a biopsy finding of disruption of the glandular architecture, infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes, or granulomas. The results of CT scanning and laparotomy rule out a bowel duplication as the cause of bleeding in this case.[4](#core-r004)The presence of hematochezia without hematemesis or blood in the gastric aspirate does not suggest a source of bleeding above the ligament of Treitz, although rapid, profuse, intermittent bleeding could have originated at any site distal to the pylorus. Esophageal varices and peptic ulcer disease caused by either *Helicobacter pylori* or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs would have been seen during endoscopy.[5](#core-r005) The clinical course is also inconsistent with intussusception, which typically causes severe colicky abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant in older children, without profuse bleeding. Schönlein–Henoch purpura, characterized by a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but skin lesions are generally present either at the onset of the illness or within six weeks thereafter, and purpura of the bowel may be detected by endoscopy.[6](#core-r006) There is also no evidence of either the hemolytic–uremic syndrome, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, uremia, and hemorrhagic colitis, or the Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which a factitious illness is reported or simulated by a parent.Bleeding from the biliary tree, which is rare in children, can be caused by trauma, a neoplasm, a gallstone, a hepatic aneurysm, an abscess, or a vascular lesion. Bleeding from the pancreas is even more rare. Hematobilia, however, typically causes upper gastrointestinal bleeding, often with biliary colic or jaundice, and hepatobiliary lesions are generally detectable by CT scanning or angiographic examination.Congenital hemangiomas of the bowel, either isolated or in the form of diffuse hemangiomatosis, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, usually in the first decade of life. Cutaneous lesions are often absent. Bowel hemangiomas may be very difficult to detect by endoscopic, radiographic, or CT examination but are generally seen at laparotomy. Patients with the Klippel–Trénaunay–Weber syndrome, which is characterized by cutaneous hemangiomas and limb hypertrophy, occasionally have bleeding from bowel lesions, particularly in the rectum. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, characterized by bluish cutaneous and gastrointestinal cavernous hemangiomas, is another rare but endoscopically detectable cause of bleeding.[7](#core-r007)Adolescents may have disorders that are more common in adults than in children, such as a hemorrhoid, a neoplasm, a diverticulum, or angiodysplasia. Hemorrhoidal thrombosis causes pain as well as bleeding but rarely causes anemia and is detectable on physical examination or by anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Neoplasms cause chronic occult bleeding more often than they cause hematochezia. In adults, diverticulosis and vascular ectasias account for more than 60 percent of major lower intestinal hemorrhages. Abrupt, painless, severe bleeding from diverticulosis originates most often in a large artery in the proximal colon and is detected by colonoscopy or angiography.[8](#core-r008)Other, less frequent causes of bleeding include a solitary rectal ulcer, colonic varices, mesenteric vascular insufficiency, and an aortoenteric fistula. Endometriosis of the bowel wall, particularly the rectum or distal ileum, can cause cyclic lower intestinal bleeding in reproductive-age females and is difficult to diagnose.[8](#core-r008) None of these disorders were apparent in this case, however, and the bleeding was not related to menses.The endoscopic and operative findings in this patient strongly suggest bleeding from the small intestine, the region of the bowel that is most difficult to study. Lesions in the small intestine often bleed slowly or intermittently, and its length, intraperitoneal location, vigorous contractility, and overlying loops hinder early diagnosis.[9](#core-r009) Contrast radiography of the small bowel, even with enteroclysis, detects obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in only 5 to 10 percent of cases. Radionuclide scanning of technetium-labeled red cells can be used to locate blood within the small bowel. Identifying the precise location of bleeding is difficult, however, and misleading information may result from the detection of pooled blood distal to the source of bleeding.[9,10](#core-r009)Angiography can detect bleeding at a rate as low as 0.5 ml per minute and can demonstrate massively bleeding lesions in the small and large bowel in over half the cases. When a bleeding lesion is identified, intraoperative injection of methylene-blue dye in a precisely positioned angiographic catheter can enable the surgeon to locate the source of hemorrhage and resect the shortest possible segment of small intestine.[11](#core-r011) A surgical exploration with palpation and transillumination of the small bowel but without other intraoperative techniques detects obscure causes of gastrointestinal bleeding, usually large vascular abnormalities or submucosal tumors, in only 10 percent of cases.[9,12](#core-r009)It is difficult to examine the small intestine endoscopically. A colonoscope can be used for upper endoscopic examination and advanced 40 to 60 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz by a technique called push enteroscopy. Specially designed enteroscopes can be pushed 80 to 120 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz. With sonde enteroscopy, the instrument has a balloon at the tip. When the balloon is propelled by peristalsis, it slowly traverses most of the small intestine, which can be viewed as the instrument is withdrawn.[13,14](#core-r013) Enteroscopy can identify obscure causes of small-bowel bleeding in nearly 40 percent of cases. Intraoperative enteroscopy, in which a colonoscope is advanced to the proximal jejunum, where the surgeon aligns short segments of small bowel for visualization until the ileocecal valve is reached, is the most effective technique for endoscopic examination, with more than 80 percent of small-bowel lesions identified in this manner.[15,16](#core-r015) Potential complications include mucosal lacerations, perforation, and prolonged ileus. Rebleeding occurs in up to 45 percent of cases.The small intestine between the ligament of Treitz and the ileocecal valve is involved in only 3 to 5 percent of cases of major gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. Angiodysplasia accounts for 70 to 80 percent of cases of bleeding of the small intestine in adults; tumors, primarily leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas, account for 5 to 10 percent; and other vascular lesions account for less than 5 percent.[9](#core-r009)Angiodysplasia, characterized by a cluster of vessels, is found predominantly in the cecum and ascending colon in patients over the age of 60 years. The disorder is associated with aging, although it has been reported in young adults. In the early stages, the lesion consists of ectatic, distorted, thin-walled veins, venules, and capillaries in the submucosa, and it can progress to involve the mucosa. Enlarged arteries and thick-walled veins are seen in the advanced stage, which is less common. Routine histopathological examination detects fewer than a third of these lesions; special techniques, including the injection of colonic vessels with silicon rubber, are necessary to detect the remainder.[17](#core-r017)Angiodysplasia may also be difficult to detect by endoscopy, since other lesions, such as telangiectasia, colitis, and artifacts created by trauma or suction, may simulate it. Endoscopic visualization of angiodysplasia and other vascular lesions may be impaired by hypovolemia, which can be caused by bleeding or by the administration of meperidine during endoscopy. Angiographic examination can identify actively bleeding lesions, as well as some lesions that have stopped bleeding. Although angiographic examination often reveals colonic angiodysplasia, it rarely detects small-bowel angiodysplasia, which is diagnosed by either enteroscopy or intraoperative endoscopy.[9,18](#core-r009)In addition to hemangiomas, vascular lesions of the small intestine include arteriovenous malformations, connective-tissue disorders, and telangiectasia. Arteriovenous malformations, which contain thick-walled arteries and veins without capillaries, are congenital and occur in the young. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by degeneration of elastic fibers of the skin, eyes, and arteries, with thickening of the skin, angioid retinal streaks, and vascular occlusion. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur in children as young as five years of age, as a result of the rupture of dilated mucosal and submucosal veins and capillaries as well as arteries.[7,19](#core-r007) The Ehlers–Danlos syndrome can result in spontaneous arterial and intestinal rupture due to a defect in collagen synthesis, as well as hyperelasticity of the skin and joints and mitral-valve prolapse.[20](#core-r020)Telangiectasia (localized dilatation of capillaries and venules) in the small intestine can be associated with Turner's syndrome and can be a component of the CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In Turner's syndrome, telangiectasia has a predilection for the small bowel. Bleeding is uncommon, usually intermittent, and self-limited, but it can be severe and persistent.[21](#core-r021) Lesions may be detected by endoscopic examination but are found more often at laparotomy. The diagnosis is based on a 45,X karyotype and phenotypic features that include short stature, transient congenital lymphedema, widely spaced nipples, a webbed neck, cubitus valgus, and gonadal dysgenesis. Features of both the CREST syndrome and Turner's syndrome were absent in this child.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia comprises a group of autosomal dominant disorders of blood vessels of the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, and brain.[22](#core-r022) Early lesions are characterized by focal dilatations of postcapillary venules. When the disorder is fully developed, the venules are markedly dilated and convoluted, have no elastic fibers, and often communicate directly with dilated arterioles; true arteriovenous malformations are infrequent. The earliest sign of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is usually epistaxis, which is present in about half the patients by the age of 20 years; cutaneous telangiectasia is detectable in about half the patients by the age of 30 years. Approximately a quarter of the patients have visceral involvement, and in about 10 percent of those with visceral involvement, it precedes other manifestations.[23,24](#core-r023) Lesions may be found in the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, or colon, usually beginning in the fifth or sixth decade of life.[25](#core-r025) Bleeding may be severe, requiring many transfusions. Hepatic arteriovenous malformations can result in high-output cardiac failure.[26](#core-r026) In rare cases, a lesion of the ampulla of Vater causes bleeding.[27](#core-r027) In one series, 15 percent of the patients had gastrointestinal manifestations, beginning between the ages of 8 and 87 years, but less than 2 percent had such manifestations before the age of 30 years. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the initial manifestation in 1 percent of the patients. Recurrent bleeding was common and was fatal in some cases.[23](#core-r023)The typical endoscopic finding in patients with gastrointestinal hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is multiple, small, red, well-defined, flat nodules, often with stellate projections and an “anemic halo.” The lesions may resemble those of erosive gastritis or iatrogenic lesions of the mucosa. In a minority of the reported cases, there is no visible external lesion or family history of the disorder.[25,28](#core-r025)Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia rarely presents in childhood. It has been reported in a 10-month-old infant with gastric involvement and hematemesis.[29](#core-r029) In four children between one and five years of age, bleeding from colonic telangiectasia preceded the development of skin lesions or epistaxis.[30](#core-r030) A one-year-old infant presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatobiliary vascular anomalies.[31](#core-r031) Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has also been reported in a nine-year-old girl,[32](#core-r032) and there have been case reports of pulmonary, brain, and urinary tract complications during the first decade of life.The patient under discussion may have had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In the absence of neoplasia, inflammation, or ulceration of the small intestine, the source of the bleeding was probably a vascular lesion. No hemangioma, arteriovenous malformation, or angiodysplasia was apparent, and there were no signs of a connective-tissue disorder or Turner's syndrome. A family history of orocutaneous telangiectasia, recurrent bleeding, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemoptysis might have been revealing, as well as examination of first- and second-degree relatives for evidence of the disease. When the patient had hematuria in infancy, cystoscopy might have detected telangiectasia of the urinary bladder. The patient had no manifestations of biliary disease, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography could have been performed to determine whether the ampulla of Vater or biliary tree was involved.Microscopical examination of the resected jejunal lesion showed no abnormal vessels. However, it may be difficult to diagnose angiodysplasia, an arteriovenous malformation, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia on the basis of histologic studies. If the patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, at least one additional lesion must have continued to bleed postoperatively, either in the area of friable mucosa in the terminal ileum or at another site.If a lesion characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia had been found, what would the therapeutic options have been? Anecdotal reports and prospective studies suggest that treatment with an estrogen–progesterone combination can prevent or decrease bleeding in some cases.[33,34](#core-r033) Aminocaproic acid, a potent inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system, decreased the frequency of bleeding episodes in two patients, perhaps by enabling fibrin to seal the bleeding sites.[35](#core-r035) Those two patients had no abnormalities of platelet aggregation or factor VIII–von Willebrand factor complex, which have been reported in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Desmopressin was effective in one patient with massive gastrointestinal bleeding from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and reduced levels of von Willebrand factor who had not had a response to treatment with cryoprecipitate.[36](#core-r036) In this case, however, if bleeding that required multiple transfusions had continued, intraoperative endoscopy and either ablative therapy or resection would have been necessary. In conclusion, this patient probably had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia involving the small intestine.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Carolyn C. Compton: The diagnostic procedure was a right-sided ileocolectomy. Examination of the specimen showed maroon-to-red mucosal blebs in the cecum and right colon ([Figure 1](#f01)). Microscopical examination of the blebs revealed blood-filled spaces that were part of an extensive plexus of thin-walled ectatic vessels, primarily involving the muscularis mucosae and superficial submucosa. Ectatic vessels traversed the muscularis mucosae, splitting its smooth-muscle fibers ([Figure 2](#f02)). These vessels had ruptured focally, with acute hemorrhage and sloughing of the overlying mucosa. Smaller vessels of identical appearance were also present focally in the muscularis propria.Immunohistochemical stains for factor VIII showed a single layer of endothelium lining the abnormal vessels ([Figure 3](#f03)). Trichrome staining confirmed the absence of smooth muscle in the vessel walls and the paucity of collagen in the perivascular connective tissue, and elastic-tissue staining showed an absence of elastic fibers ([Figure 4](#f04)). No vessels with abnormalities of the muscle layers, such as arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms, were identified. The telangiectatic lesions were characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or Osler–Weber–Rendu disease.Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia occurs in all races, with an estimated frequency of 1 case per 2300 persons to 1 per 39,000, depending on the population studied.[22](#core-r022) Although the pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant, 20 percent of the patients do not have a family history of the disorder.[29](#core-r029) Approximately 10 percent of affected persons are asymptomatic and never report bleeding.[37](#core-r037)The vascular dysplasias encompassed by this disease include, in addition to telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, venous varicosities, arteriovenous fistulas, and aneurysms. The relative frequency of these lesions varies among affected families.The pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia has not yet been fully elucidated, but genetic studies have shown that it is a family of disorders caused by mutations in various genes.[22](#core-r022) Thus far, genetic linkages have been established at chromosome 9q33–q34 in some families[38,39](#core-r038) and at chromosome 12q in others.[40,41](#core-r040) A mutation of the gene for endoglin, the most abundant transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)–binding protein on endothelial-cell membranes, has been identified as a specific molecular abnormality in one form of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.[42](#core-r042) Current data suggest that the mutation of this gene, located at chromosome 9q3, results in either reduced production of normal protein or production of a protein that interferes with the normal function of endoglin. Presumably, with the loss of normal endoglin-binding function, endothelial-cell responses to TGF-β, including the migration, proliferation, adhesion, and production or organization of the extracellular matrix, are impaired, leading to vascular dysplasias.Dr. Harland S. Winter: Additional information became available after the diagnostic procedure had been performed. The child's maternal grandfather had epistaxis as a teenager and occasionally as an adult. An otolaryngologist identified telangiectasias in one of the grandfather's ears and in his nose and lower lip when he was 67 years old. Also, a maternal uncle had a history of recurrent nosebleeds, but examination of his nose by an otolaryngologist showed no abnormalities. Two of five maternal aunts had intermittent epistaxis, but neither has been evaluated by an otolaryngologist. None of the patient's first cousins have reported bleeding.Dr. Lewis B. Holmes: Several aspects of this child's story were instructive from the standpoint of a clinical geneticist. When she was hospitalized initially, there was no reported family history of disorders suggesting hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Later, we learned that one grandparent had had nosebleeds. The issue was finally resolved when an otolaryngologist who was familiar with the appearance of nasal telangiectases in this disease examined the potentially affected relatives. This experience underscores the importance of pursuing the family history carefully and consulting knowledgeable examiners. Haitjema et al.[43](#core-r043) have shown that many asymptomatic family members who may carry the gene for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can benefit from careful screening, since it often reveals clinically important, treatable lesions.The importance of the extra effort made to identify affected family members in this case is reminiscent of the experience with tuberous sclerosis, another autosomal dominant disorder in which the diagnosis is typically made first in the most severely affected child in the family. A cursory family history at that time may be negative. In one study,[44](#core-r044) careful screening of the parents of affected children, including examination for subtle skin lesions characteristic of tuberous sclerosis, CT scanning of the brain to detect tubers, and ultrasonography of the kidneys to detect angiomyolipomas, showed that 4 of 26 parents (15 percent) who initially had been considered unaffected had subtle signs of the disease.It is important for clinicians to help geneticists identify extended families in which several members have a genetic disorder and are willing to participate in genetic-linkage studies, which can be important for the family. The family physician can facilitate these studies, which usually require only venipuncture.Dr. Winter: After the diagnosis had been made, radiographic studies of the lungs and brain showed no vascular abnormalities. The patient continued to pass bright red blood rectally and to require blood transfusions. Because we suspected more extensive small-bowel or colonic involvement, we administered aminocaproic acid intravenously and subsequently switched to a dose of 3.75 g orally three times daily. She is currently taking 1.5 g of aminocaproic acid three times daily. Her hematocrit is 39 percent, and she has not had any clinical evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding for nine months.\\n\",\n",

      "Question: A 37-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of headaches and memory loss.\n",
      "She was well until seven months earlier, when she began to experience nausea and vomiting. Two days later a brief syncopal episode occurred, and a few days thereafter she became transiently disoriented, anxious, and agitated. She did not recognize her friends. She was taken to a local hospital, where examination showed that the blood pressure was 170 mm Hg systolic; no other abnormality was found. A tranquilizer was prescribed, with apparent improvement. She soon began to complain of diffuse headaches that were present on awakening and often increased during the night. A physician found no neurologic abnormality. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. After another month or two the headaches diminished, but she slept poorly, was depressed, and lost 9 kg in weight.\n",
      "One month before entry the headaches worsened. Neurologic examination was negative. A CT scan disclosed a ring-enhancing lesion with a smooth internal border in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration-biopsy specimen of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. Dexamethasone, phenytoin sodium, cimetidine, and diazepam were prescribed, and she was referred to this hospital.\n",
      "The patient was right-handed. She was a native of Brazil, where she resided in a metropolitan area and often traveled to sheepherding areas. There was a history of a febrile seizure at the age of three years and of rheumatic fever in childhood. She had experienced intermittent migraine headaches for 10 years. She frequently consumed uncooked beef. There was no history of recent seizures or syncope, sensory loss, fever, allergy, cutaneous lesions, use of tobacco or alcohol, or exposure to infectious diseases.\n",
      "The temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\n",
      "On examination the patient was confused and emotional, with child-like behavior. The head and neck were normal. No lymphadenopathy or rash was found. The lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. The liver and spleen were not felt. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\n",
      "Neurologic examination showed that the patient was oriented as to place but poorly oriented as to time. Remote memory appeared normal, but she recalled only one of five objects after three minutes and could not name the president of her country. She was unable to perform simple mathematical problems and failed on the test of serial subtraction of sevens from 100. The nasal margins of the optic disks appeared slightly elevated. The cranial nerves were otherwise normal except that she avoided looking toward objects in the left superior quadrant of the visual field. Motor functions were normal.

      "Dr. Amy A. Pruitt\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient's country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient's lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient's symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient's seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen's disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen's disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient's lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient's initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient's cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient's course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn't mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\n",

      "Dr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\n",

      "Question: A 37-year-old Brazilian woman with a history of intermittent migraine headaches and frequent consumption of uncooked beef presented with a seven-month history of nausea, vomiting, syncopal episode, disorientation, anxiety, agitation, and headaches. Initial CT scan was negative, but a repeat scan one month prior to admission revealed a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration biopsy of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. On admission, neurological examination revealed confusion, disorientation to time, memory deficits, dyscalculia, left superior quadrantanopia, and cortical sensory deficits.

Two days later a brief syncopal episode occurred, and a few days thereafter she became transiently disoriented, anxious, and agitated. She did not recognize her friends. She was taken to a local hospital, where examination showed that the blood pressure was 170 mm Hg systolic; no other abnormality was found. A tranquilizer was prescribed, with apparent improvement. She soon began to complain of diffuse headaches that were present on awakening and often increased during the night. A physician found no neurologic abnormality. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. After another month or two the headaches diminished, but she slept poorly, was depressed, and lost 9 kg in weight.\\nOne month before entry the headaches worsened. Neurologic examination was negative. A CT scan disclosed a ring-enhancing lesion with a smooth internal border in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration-biopsy specimen of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. Dexamethasone, phenytoin sodium, cimetidine, and diazepam were prescribed, and she was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was right-handed. She was a native of Brazil, where she resided in a metropolitan area and often traveled to sheepherding areas. There was a history of a febrile seizure at the age of three years and of rheumatic fever in childhood. She had experienced intermittent migraine headaches for 10 years. She frequently consumed uncooked beef. There was no history of recent seizures or syncope, sensory loss, fever, allergy, cutaneous lesions, use of tobacco or alcohol, or exposure to infectious diseases.\\nThe temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\\nOn examination the patient was confused and emotional, with child-like behavior. The head and neck were normal. No lymphadenopathy or rash was found. The lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. The liver and spleen were not felt. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\\nNeurologic examination showed that the patient was oriented as to place but poorly oriented as to time. Remote memory appeared normal, but she recalled only one of five objects after three minutes and could not name the president of her country. She was unable to perform simple mathematical problems and failed on the test of serial subtraction of sevens from 100. The nasal margins of the optic disks appeared slightly elevated. The cranial nerves were otherwise normal except that she avoided looking toward objects in the left superior quadrant of the visual field. Motor functions were normal. Tests of cerebellar function were well performed, and gait and station were normal. The tendon reflexes were ++ and equal; the plantar responses were flexor. Examination of sensory functions was negative. She was unable to interpret any numbers traced on her palms and often indicated the wrong lateralization of pinprick of the upper extremities.\\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 33.7 per cent; the white-cell count was 8300, with 47 per cent neutrophils, 48 per cent lymphocytes, and 5 per cent monocytes. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm per hour, and the total eosinophil count 53 per cubic millimeter. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg per 100 ml (5.0 mmol per liter), the calcium 8.5 mg per 100 ml (2.1 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 4.6 mg per 100 ml (1.5 mmol per liter), and the protein 6.1 g (the albumin 3.5 g, and the globulin 2.6 g) per 100 ml.

Films of the paranasal sinuses disclosed that the turbinates were enlarged and the septum was deviated to the left; the paranasal sinuses were clear, and the pituitary fossa was normal; a left posterior parietal craniectomy defect was present. Films of the skull revealed that the pineal gland was not calcified; no abnormal intracranial calcifications were evident. A CT scan of the brain (\\nFig. 1\\n), performed after the injection of contrast material, disclosed an area of ring-enhancement in the right anterior temporal region and another area of enhancement in the left posterolateral parietal area, superior and lateral to the lateral ventricle; neither lesion showed a mass effect or perifocal low density. An ultrasound examination of the liver and gallbladder was negative. Scans of the kidneys showed no evidence of hydronephrosis. An x-ray film of the abdomen was normal. An echocardiogram demonstrated prominence of the left coronary sinus and slight mitral-valve prolapse; no valvular vegetations were seen. An electroencephalogram showed nearly continuous, moderate voltage and generalized theta and delta slowing, more prominent on the left side. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid under an initial pressure of 230 mm; the fluid contained 14 red cells, 3 lymphocytes, and 1 larger monocyte per cubic millimeter; microscopical examination disclosed no microorganisms, including fungi and acid-fast bacilli, and an India-ink preparation was negative; xanthochromia was graded 1 on a scale of 10; the protein was 84 mg, and the glucose 61 mg per 100 ml (3.4 mmol per liter), with a simultaneous blood glucose of 92 mg per 100 ml (5.1 mmol per liter); a serologic test for syphilis and a test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen were negative; immunoelectrophoresis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed that IgG was 6.7 mg (normal, 0 to 8.6 mg), and the albumin 51.5 mg per 100 ml (normal, 11 to 48 mg); agarose-gel electrophoresis disclosed no banding on an eightfold concentrated specimen; a cytocentrifugation study revealed 306 cells per milliliter, of which 2 per cent were neutrophils, 53 per cent lymphocytes, and 45 per cent monocytes. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was negative for tumor cells, and a culture yielded no microorganisms. Two blood cultures were negative. Review of the biopsy specimen of the brain obtained elsewhere disclosed that the material was not diagnostic.

       "  'reasoning': '\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Amy A. Pruitt\\\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient\\'s country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient\\'s lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient\\'s symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient\\'s seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient\\'s lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months\\' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient\\'s initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months\\' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient\\'s course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn\\'t mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\\n',\n",

       "   'question': 'A 37-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of headaches and memory loss.\\nShe was well until seven months earlier, when she began to experience nausea and vomiting. Two days later a brief syncopal episode occurred, and a few days thereafter she became transiently disoriented, anxious, and agitated. She did not recognize her friends. She was taken to a local hospital, where examination showed that the blood pressure was 170 mm Hg systolic; no other abnormality was found. A tranquilizer was prescribed, with apparent improvement. She soon began to complain of diffuse headaches that were present on awakening and often increased during the night. A physician found no neurologic abnormality. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. After another month or two the headaches diminished, but she slept poorly, was depressed, and lost 9 kg in weight.\\nOne month before entry the headaches worsened. Neurologic examination was negative. A CT scan disclosed a ring-enhancing lesion with a smooth internal border in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration-biopsy specimen of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. Dexamethasone, phenytoin sodium, cimetidine, and diazepam were prescribed, and she was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was right-handed. She was a native of Brazil, where she resided in a metropolitan area and often traveled to sheepherding areas. There was a history of a febrile seizure at the age of three years and of rheumatic fever in childhood. She had experienced intermittent migraine headaches for 10 years. She frequently consumed uncooked beef. There was no history of recent seizures or syncope, sensory loss, fever, allergy, cutaneous lesions, use of tobacco or alcohol, or exposure to infectious diseases.\\nThe temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\\nOn examination the patient was confused and emotional, with child-like behavior. The head and neck were normal. No lymphadenopathy or rash was found. The lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. The liver and spleen were not felt. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\\nNeurologic examination showed that the patient was oriented as to place but poorly oriented as to time. Remote memory appeared normal, but she recalled only one of five objects after three minutes and could not name the president of her country. She was unable to perform simple mathematical problems and failed on the test of serial subtraction of sevens from 100. The nasal margins of the optic disks appeared slightly elevated. The cranial nerves were otherwise normal except that she avoided looking toward objects in the left superior quadrant of the visual field. Motor functions were normal. Tests of cerebellar function were well performed, and gait and station were normal. The tendon reflexes were ++ and equal; the plantar responses were flexor. Examination of sensory functions was negative. She was unable to interpret any numbers traced on her palms and often indicated the wrong lateralization of pinprick of the upper extremities.\\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 33.7 per cent; the white-cell count was 8300, with 47 per cent neutrophils, 48 per cent lymphocytes, and 5 per cent monocytes.

An electrocardiogram was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal. Films of the thighs showed no calcification within the quadriceps muscles. Films of the paranasal sinuses disclosed that the turbinates were enlarged and the septum was deviated to the left; the paranasal sinuses were clear, and the pituitary fossa was normal; a left posterior parietal craniectomy defect was present. Films of the skull revealed that the pineal gland was not calcified; no abnormal intracranial calcifications were evident. A CT scan of the brain (\\nFig. 1\\n), performed after the injection of contrast material, disclosed an area of ring-enhancement in the right anterior temporal region and another area of enhancement in the left posterolateral parietal area, superior and lateral to the lateral ventricle; neither lesion showed a mass effect or perifocal low density. An ultrasound examination of the liver and gallbladder was negative. Scans of the kidneys showed no evidence of hydronephrosis. An x-ray film of the abdomen was normal. An echocardiogram demonstrated prominence of the left coronary sinus and slight mitral-valve prolapse; no valvular vegetations were seen. An electroencephalogram showed nearly continuous, moderate voltage and generalized theta and delta slowing, more prominent on the left side. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid under an initial pressure of 230 mm; the fluid contained 14 red cells, 3 lymphocytes, and 1 larger monocyte per cubic millimeter; microscopical examination disclosed no microorganisms, including fungi and acid-fast bacilli, and an India-ink preparation was negative; xanthochromia was graded 1 on a scale of 10; the protein was 84 mg, and the glucose 61 mg per 100 ml (3.4 mmol per liter), with a simultaneous blood glucose of 92 mg per 100 ml (5.1 mmol per liter); a serologic test for syphilis and a test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen were negative; immunoelectrophoresis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed that IgG was 6.7 mg (normal, 0 to 8.6 mg), and the albumin 51.5 mg per 100 ml (normal, 11 to 48 mg); agarose-gel electrophoresis disclosed no banding on an eightfold concentrated specimen; a cytocentrifugation study revealed 306 cells per milliliter, of which 2 per cent were neutrophils, 53 per cent lymphocytes, and 45 per cent monocytes. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was negative for tumor cells, and a culture yielded no microorganisms. Two blood cultures were negative. Review of the biopsy specimen of the brain obtained elsewhere disclosed that the material was not diagnostic.

       "   'reasoning': '\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Amy A. Pruitt\\\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient\\'s country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient\\'s lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient\\'s symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient\\'s seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient\\'s lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months\\' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient\\'s initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months\\' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient\\'s course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn\\'t mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\\n',\n",

Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient\\'s lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months\\' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient\\'s initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months\\' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient\\'s course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn\\'t mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\\n',\n",

      "Question: Dr. Matthew T. Bianchi\n",
      "(Neurology): A 57-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of progressive cognitive decline. He had a history of recurrent malignant melanoma of the right conjunctiva and eyelid that was treated at this hospital. Nine days before admission, a nurse from the melanoma clinic who contacted him by telephone for a preappointment interview noted that he was incoherent and unable to answer her questions. Four days later, at a clinic visit, his physician noted that the patient had difficulty understanding the conversation. Options for treatment of the malignant melanoma, including orbital exenteration, were discussed with the patient and his wife.\n",
      "The next morning, at 3 a.m., his wife awoke to find the patient having convulsive movements in bed. The seizure lasted less than 5 minutes, after which he remained unresponsive. Emergency medical services providers were called; on their arrival 10 minutes later, he had regained consciousness but was incontinent of urine, disoriented, and unable to follow commands. He was transported to the emergency department of another hospital.\n",
      "On examination, the patient appeared confused. The vital signs were normal, and the oxygen saturation was 97% while he was breathing ambient air. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the fluid revealed no cells and normal levels of protein and glucose, no organisms were detected on Gram's and acid-fast staining, and polymerase-chain-reaction testing for JC virus was negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed generalized atrophy; there was no evidence of hemorrhage. An electroencephalogram showed diffuse theta-range background slowing but no epileptiform activity. He was admitted to the hospital. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T\n",

      "-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain after the administration of gadolinium showed generalized brain atrophy and diffuse white-matter hyperintensity. Lorazepam, haloperidol, phenytoin, levetiracetam, acyclovir, and ceftriaxone were administered. His mental status deteriorated, and he became intermittently agitated. On the fifth day, he was transferred to this hospital.\n",
      "On further questioning at this hospital, the patient's wife reported that she had noticed occasional episodes of confusion and disorientation during the previous 5 years. During the previous 2 months, she had noticed a change in his behavior, with more frequent episodes of disorientation and progressive impairment in his memory, including forgetting to switch off electrical appliances and having difficulty making out checks and using the computer.\n",
      "A diagnosis of malignant melanoma of the right eyelid had been made approximately 5 years earlier and was treated with excision; recurrent melanomas on the conjunctiva, lower eyelid, and lacrimal caruncle of the right eye were excised during the next 4 years, most recently 2 months before admission. At that time, CT of the head and chest showed no metastatic lesions. The patient had a history of head trauma and extradural hematoma in infancy and had had a left frontoparietal craniotomy, with no apparent residual cognitive deficit. He had emphysema, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression and had undergone bilateral lens implantations. He had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (diagnosed more than 15 years earlier) and had a serum HCV RNA level of 1.6 million IU per milliliter 1 month before admission.\n",
      "The patient was right-handed, lived with his wife, and had one adult daughter. He smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol socially. In the past, he had abused alcohol and taken cocaine, amphetamines, LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), and marijuana, as well as intravenous heroin, but he had not used illicit drugs for at least 10 years. He had been an average student and had left school at the age of 16 years to enter the workforce. At the time of hospital admission, he worked in an office position, but in past employment, he had been exposed to organic solvents, primarily industrial degreasers. His father died of kidney cancer, and his mother of colon cancer; one brother died at the age of 59 years of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and another brother died at the age of 15 years in a motor vehicle accident. There was no known family history of neurologic disease. He had no known allergies. Medications on admission included metoprolol, haloperidol, lorazepam, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, docusate, levetiracetam, and thiamine.\n",
      "On examination, the patient was disheveled, cachectic, and intermittently agitated. The temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 107 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was bald, the right eyelid was scarred, pigmented areas were noted on both irises, the mucous membranes were dry, and several teeth were missing. There were no dysmorphic features. Breath sounds were decreased at both lung bases. There was clubbing of the fingers, and there were multiple tattoos on the skin. Testing of the cranial nerves, motor and sensory systems, coordination, deep-tendon reflexes, plantar responses, and gait disclosed no abnormalities. There were bilateral grasp responses. He recognized his spouse and his caregivers, but he was not oriented to place or time. Simple attention was markedly impaired. He was restless and distracted and needed to be repeatedly redirected to tasks. He spoke continuously and intelligibly but with verbal perseveration. His speech was a fluent, meaningless stream of words, nonwords, and jargon. He could not name common objects, follow simple verbal commands, read, or write. More detailed cognitive testing was impossible because of deficits in attention and language.\n",
      "A complete blood count was normal, as were levels of serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, bilirubin, and troponin T. Coagulation and renal-function tests also were normal. The alkaline phosphatase level was 130 U per liter (reference range, 45 to 115), the aspartate aminotransferase level 54 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), and the alanine aminotransferase level 67 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55). Testing of blood for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, rapid-plasma-reagin testing, and a paraneoplastic antibody panel were negative. A chest radiograph was normal.\n",
      "On the second hospital day, an electroencephalogram revealed generalized low-amplitude theta-range slowing without superimposed epileptiform activity. The patient's agitation decreased, and haloperidol was stopped. Electrocardiography disclosed first-degree atrioventricular block; metoprolol was stopped, and lisinopril was begun.

      "*Dr. Daniel J. Costello:* I cared for this patient and am aware of the diagnosis. This 57-year-old man with previously stable cognition presented with a 2-month history of deteriorating intellectual function and behavior, which precipitously worsened after a seizure. In retrospect, he had shown intermittent signs of cognitive dysfunction during the preceding 5 years, suggesting an insidious onset of his disease. He had a history of substance abuse, occupational exposure to organic solvents, active HCV infection, and malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva of his right eye, thought to be at significant risk for dissemination. Examination revealed pronounced impairment in attention, language, comportment, and probably memory, which decreased his functional independence. The clinical scenario is that of rapidly progressive dementia, which is defined as a state of progressive, sustained impairment in multiple domains of cognitive function (usually but not always involving memory) occurring in clear consciousness that is sufficiently severe as to impede personal, social, or vocational functions. This is a common and challenging clinical problem, since there are many possible causes ([Table 1](#t01)), and prompt diagnosis is essential to determine whether it is treatable.This patient's dementia reflects dysfunction of diffuse cortical structures, subcortical structures, or both. He does not have characteristic clinical abnormalities associated with cerebral cortical dysfunction, such as aphasia, neglect, or apraxia. Impaired attention and forgetfulness, psychomotor slowing, impaired executive and visuospatial skills, change in personality, and emotional disturbance, many of which our patient had, raise the possibility of subcortical dementia due to white-matter disease. Seizures may occasionally occur in white-matter diseases.The investigative approach to a patient such as this with rapidly progressive dementia requires a thorough clinical history and physical examination and then laboratory tests as summarized in [Table 2](#t02). Testing for rare disorders such as inborn errors of metabolism is sometimes indicated. A brain biopsy is necessary in a small fraction of patients. In this patient, the results of the investigations listed in [Table 2](#t02) were normal, except for the results of liver-function tests (presumed to be abnormal because of chronic HCV infection) and the findings on electroencephalography.Dr. Grant, may we review the imaging studies?*Dr. P. Ellen Grant:* CT scanning of the brain ([Figure 1A](#f01)) revealed generalized atrophy and decreased attenuation in the peritrigonal regions. There was no evidence of hemorrhage. MRI of the brain ([Figure 1B](#f01)) revealed generalized brain atrophy and symmetric, confluent increased FLAIR and T2-weighted signal in the parietal and temporal lobes, in the posterior body and splenium of the corpus callosum, and in additional areas in the frontal lobes and the lateral midbrain ([Figure 1C](#f01)). Diffusion-weighted imaging (Fig. 1 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP3602171DC1), available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) shows peripheral linear areas of increased diffusion-weighted-imaging signal in the corpus callosum indicating an outer rim of decreased diffusion. After the administration of contrast material, an incomplete peripheral rim of enhancement was seen around the T2 signal abnormality that crossed through the corpus callosum ([Figure 1D](#f01)).*Dr. Costello:* The clinical presentation and imaging abnormalities led to a working diagnosis of a progressive white-matter disease, or leukoencephalopathy. Although the early signs of this disorder are subtle, advanced leukoencephalopathies are associated with progressive abulia, spasticity, frontal-release signs, incontinence, and the development of cortical signs. In the terminal stages, patients progress into a state of akinetic mutism, followed by stupor, coma, and death. This patient presented in the advanced stages of this clinical spectrum.The most useful diagnostic tool for determining the cause of primary white-matter disease is the pattern of white-matter changes on MRI. Symmetric white-matter changes, seen in this patient, are characteristic of disorders causing diffuse white-matter injury such as symmetrically infiltrative tumors, hereditary white-matter diseases, metabolic injury (anoxia, carbon monoxide poisoning, mitochondrial disorders), or exposure to a white-matter toxin; conversely, asymmetric or multifocal imaging patterns are more likely a result of vascularly mediated or inflammatory disorders or infections.\n",
      "### Symmetric Leukoencephalopathy\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had active HCV infection, but active HCV infection, in the absence of secondary vasculitis or cryoglobulinemia, is not associated with progressive white-matter disease. He had a history of recurrent localized malignant melanoma, but there was no evidence of parenchymal metastases or leptomeningeal infiltration. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was unlikely, since the patient did not seem to be immunocompromised and did not display any cortical neurologic deficits, and the imaging abnormalities were not typical of that disorder. There were no clinical features suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder. There was no history of acute hypoxic injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, radiation therapy, or treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.\n",
      "### Toxic Leukoencephalopathy\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had a history of exposure to a number of potential white-matter toxins, including alcohol, cocaine, heroin, and organic solvents, making toxic leukoencephalopathy a prime consideration.[1](#core-r001) Toxic leukoencephalopathies can manifest clinically at various intervals after exposure to a toxin.\n",
      "### Substance Abuse\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient had a history of heavy alcohol use. Although some neurologic syndromes are ascribed to chronic alcohol abuse,[2](#core-r002) the fulminant clinical deterioration in this patient, whose current alcohol intake was not excessive, in conjunction with the extensive white-matter abnormalities on MRI is not typical of these syndromes. Cocaine use may lead to cerebral infarcts caused by vasospasm or vasculitis, hemorrhage, seizures, and, in rare cases, a devastating acute toxic leukoencephalopathy.[3](#core-r003) These complications typically occur in patients with acute toxic effects from cocaine use. Cocaine overdose may lead to respiratory depression sufficiently severe to cause diffuse anoxic brain injury. It is not clear whether chronic cocaine use alone leads to a distinct toxic leukoencephalopathy.Inhalation of vaporized heroin (known as “chasing the dragon”) has been associated with a severe acute leukoencephalopathy resulting from extensive damage to white matter, the cerebellum, and basal ganglia,[4](#core-r004) possibly due to heroin pyrolysate.[5](#core-r005) Heroin leukoencephalopathy is less common with other modes of heroin use, but it has been described with intravenous use, usually in cases of overdose.[6](#core-r006) This patient had not used cocaine or vaporized heroin during the preceding decade, making cocaine-related or heroin-related leukoencephalopathy unlikely.\n",
      "### Organic Solvents\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient had handled degreasers and glues on a regular basis, making the possibility of leukoencephalopathy due to exposure to organic solvents (organic-solvent leukoencephalopathy) a prime consideration.[7](#core-r007) Chronic exposure to these highly lipophilic chemicals, either occupationally or through abuse, may disrupt the integrity of myelin and impair neural transmission, resulting in a toxic leukoencephalopathy.[8](#core-r008) These leukoencephalopathies generally occur after chronic, moderate-to-high-level exposure, and thus the time course in this case would be consistent with toxic leukoencephalopathy.\n",
      "### Hereditary Leukodystrophies in Adulthood\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this patient had several risk factors for toxic leukoencephalopathy, the possibility of a hereditary white-matter disorder characterized by loss of myelin from white-matter tracts (leukodystrophy) first presenting in adulthood had to be considered.[9](#core-r009) The most common leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), may present in adults, and in this patient the bilateral posterior, symmetric, confluent white-matter signal abnormalities that became slightly enhanced after the administration of gadolinium are consistent with those described in cases of X-ALD. However, the fulminant deterioration, apparent absence of affected family members, and lack of spasticity and sphincter dysfunction are unusual. Metachromatic leukodystrophy may present in adulthood, often with variable combinations of cognitive, behavioral, and neuropsychiatric disturbances, peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy, and dystonia. Globoid-cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe's disease) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal-storage disorder that may rarely present in adulthood. Imaging abnormalities include a posterior leukoencephalopathy with involvement of the pyramidal tract and corpus callosum. Of the hereditary leukodystrophies, X-ALD is the most plausible, primarily because of the imaging findings, although the clinical presentation was unusual.\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "The clinical history and physical examination, in conjunction with the imaging findings, suggest either a toxic leukoencephalopathy or a late presentation of hereditary leukodystrophy, in particular the cerebral form of X-ALD. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate quickly in this hospital. Because of his precipitous clinical decline and the lack of a diagnosis, a stereotactic biopsy was performed, during which a specimen of white matter was obtained from the right parietal region. The intention was to obtain samples from a radiologically abnormal area traversing both the rim of contrast enhancement and the underlying white matter that displayed abnormal signal changes.\n",

      "*Dr. Pavan K. Auluck:* Microscopical examination of the biopsy specimen revealed slightly hypercellular, gliotic white matter with granular eosinophilic material ([Figure 2A](#f02)) and patchy loss of myelin ([Figure 2B](#f02)). The presence of granular eosinophilic material raised the suspicion of a storage disorder. Immunohistochemical analysis ([Figure 2C](#f02)) revealed a reduction in the number of axons within the areas of myelin loss. There were no nuclei with viral-type changes suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and immunostaining for the large T antigen (directed against epitopes shared by JC virus and simian virus 40 [SV40]) was negative. Numerous macrophages ([Figure 2D](#f02)) filled with granular periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)–positive, diastase-resistant material ([Figure 2E](#f02)) were located within perivascular spaces and scattered throughout the white matter.The differential diagnosis of PAS-positive macrophages within the brain is limited and includes Whipple's disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, globoid-cell leukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, acquired leukoencephalopathy due to toxins, and other hereditary leukodystrophies. In Whipple's disease, the macrophages are typically limited to perivascular spaces without parenchymal infiltration.Ultrastructural examination ([Figure 2F](#f02)) revealed that the macrophages contained numerous lamellar structures within membrane-bound organelles. No intracellular bacteria (expected in Whipple's disease) were identified. The ultrastructural evidence of membrane-bound lamellar material within macrophages leaves two possibilities: toxic and hereditary metabolic disorders. These neuropathological findings have been described in the context of exposure to organic solvents.[10](#core-r010) Among metabolic disorders, this constellation of findings can be seen in late-onset X-ALD[11–13](#core-r011) as well as in other genetic causes for which genes have not been identified.[14](#core-r014)\n",
      "### X-ALD\n",
      "\n",
      "*Dr. Florian S. Eichler:* Once the diagnosis of X-ALD was suggested by the pattern of the brain MRI and the brain biopsy, targeted testing of specific organelle function (peroxisome, lysosome, and mitochondrion) was the next step. Very-long-chain fatty acids (more than 20 carbons) are degraded in the peroxisome, and therefore, disorders of the peroxisome such as X-ALD lead to the accumulation of these fatty acids in plasma.[15](#core-r015) In this case, testing revealed elevations in the plasma level of very-long-chain fatty acids ([Table 3](#t03)). The *ABCD1* gene on Xq28, which codes for the peroxisomal membrane protein (not an enzyme) ABCD1, a member of the family of proteins known as ATP-binding cassette transporters, is mutated in X-ALD[16,17](#core-r016) ([www.x-ald.nl](https://www.x-ald.nl)). The mechanisms by which the defect in the *ABCD1* gene leads to the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids and the associated phenotypic manifestation are poorly understood. In this patient, analysis of the mutation revealed a substitution of arginine by glutamine at amino acid residue 591, confirming the diagnosis of X-ALD. Further testing of cerebrospinal fluid for the DNA of *Tropheryma whipplei* (which causes Whipple's disease) and testing for *NOTCH3* mutations and a lysosomal-enzyme screen were normal.How unusual is this patient's presentation, and should this diagnosis be considered in all adults with progressive leukoencephalopathy, even those without a family history?[18](#core-r018) Leukodystrophies are characterized by normal early development, followed by loss of skills and regression as the myelin deteriorates. Approximately 35% of patients with X-ALD have the childhood cerebral form, with onset of dementia and adrenal insufficiency between 4 and 8 years of age. Seizures are uncommon but may occur. In another 35 to 40% of patients, the disorder presents in young adulthood as a slowly progressive paraparesis, with sphincter disturbances due to the involvement of long tracts in the spinal cord, referred to as adrenomyeloneuropathy. Rapidly progressive inflammatory demyelination develops in 20% of these patients, and they die in 1 to 2 years.[19,20](#core-r019)Several unusual features in this patient contributed to the delay in diagnosis. His advanced age at the onset of symptoms is uncommon for X-ALD, as is the rapid progression of cerebral disease. More important, he lacked a history of long-tract signs, and most adults with X-ALD have signs and symptoms of a myeloneuropathy by the time they are his age. In adults, cognitive abnormalities can manifest as neuropsychiatric symptoms, and substance abuse, which was a prominent feature of this patient's history, is not uncommon. However, his long history of drug abuse and exposure to environmental toxins further confounded the diagnostic workup, since it provided a more likely explanation for the onset of new symptoms at his age. An important issue for this patient is that the neuropathology of organic-solvent leukoencephalopathy can be indistinguishable from that of cerebral X-ALD on examination of biopsy specimens.[10](#core-r010) In organic-solvent leukoencephalopathy, very-long-chain fatty acids also accumulate in the brain, and the findings of lamellar inclusions in both disorders may reflect this fact. However, the accumulation of these fatty acids in plasma is seen only in cases of X-ALD. Furthermore, the lack of an obvious family history in this case decreased the suspicion for a heritable neurologic disease.Currently, approximately 2000 patients in the United States have been diagnosed with X-ALD as a result of plasma testing of very-long-chain fatty acids.[21](#core-r021) Unfortunately, many adults with leukodystrophies remain undiagnosed, in part because their symptoms are attributed to substance abuse or other disorders such as multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia.\n",

      "Discussion of Management\n",
      "------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "*Dr. Eichler:* General supportive care and symptomatic treatment for the patient and his family are crucial. Specialist consultation, nursing, schools, rehabilitation, and social agencies are the cornerstones of the care and treatment of patients with X-ALD. Current medical therapies for patients with X-ALD include hormone-replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency, dietary therapy with Lorenzo's oil (a combination of oleic acid and erucic acid), and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.[22](#core-r022) Other approaches are still under investigation.This patient had no signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, and a corticotropin stimulation test was normal, but continued vigilance is necessary. Physical stress and minor illnesses can be detrimental to patients who have adrenoleukodystrophy with adrenal insufficiency. Dietary therapy and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation are beneficial only for patients who are asymptomatic or in the early stages of the illness.[22,23](#core-r022) Unfortunately, this patient's condition, like that of more than half of patients with cerebral involvement, was too advanced to benefit from currently available therapies.Further questioning of family members revealed that a maternal male cousin had spent many years in a wheelchair; he may have had X-ALD. More important, the patient's daughter was an obligate carrier of the mutation, and her 4-year-old son had an elevated level of very-long-chain fatty acids. He currently has no symptoms and a brain MRI was normal, but he carries a 35% risk of the development of a devastating inflammatory demyelination in the next 6 years. He has been placed on Lorenzo's oil to lower the level of the fatty acids and will receive brain MRIs annually.In hindsight, there are several lessons to be learned from this case. First, genetic and metabolic markers are useful in the workup of neurologic decline not only in children but also in adults. In addition, a history of drug abuse should not sway one from considering genetic causes of neurologic symptoms. This case reminds us that genetic disorders may present in adulthood. In retrospect, this patient's MRI findings are typical of X-ALD, but this possibility was not seriously considered because of the patient's age and other risk factors for leukoencephalopathy. Screening for genetic disorders, including testing for levels of very-long-chain fatty acids, could prevent the performance of unnecessary brain biopsies in a subgroup of adult patients presenting with cognitive decline. Finally, establishing the diagnosis of a neurogenetic disorder allows for family screening and identification of at-risk family members.*Dr. Costello:* The patient's deterioration continued relentlessly and progressed toward a state of akinetic mutism. He died of bronchopneumonia 10 months after his original clinical presentation.\n",

      "Question: A 57-year-old man with a history of recurrent malignant melanoma, remote head trauma with craniotomy, emphysema, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, HCV infection, and past substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, LSD, marijuana) presents with a 2-month history of progressive cognitive decline, including disorientation, memory impairment, and behavioral changes, culminating in a seizure. Initial workup at an outside hospital revealed generalized brain atrophy on CT, diffuse theta-range slowing on EEG, and diffuse white-matter hyperintensity on FLAIR and T2-weighted MRI. Examination reveals marked impairment in attention and language, with fluent but meaningless speech and inability to follow commands. MRI shows generalized cerebral atrophy, asymmetric hyperintensity within the occipitoparietal and posterior temporal subcortical deep and periventricular white matter extending into the lateral aspects of the cerebral peduncles, patchy enhancement along the subcortical U-fibers in both parietal lobes, relative sparing of the cerebellum, and thinning of the corpus callosum. Magnetic resonance angiography shows no vascular occlusions or stenoses. Given these findings, and the patient's history of occupational exposure to organic solvents, what specific diagnostic test is most critical to differentiate between toxic leukoencephalopathy due to organic solvents and a hereditary leukodystrophy?\n",
      "Reasoning: Okay, let's think. The patient presents with a leukoencephalopathy, meaning a disease affecting the white matter of the brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to differentiate between a toxic cause (organic solvents) and a hereditary cause (a leukodystrophy).\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient has a history of occupational exposure to organic solvents, making toxic leukoencephalopathy a strong initial consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the fact that the cerebellum is relatively spared and the corpus callosum is thinning suggests a more selective white matter involvement than typically seen in diffuse toxic exposures. Toxic leukoencephalopathies often present with more widespread and symmetrical damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hereditary leukodystrophies are genetic disorders that affect the development or maintenance of myelin, the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain's white matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different leukodystrophies affect different components of myelin or the cells that produce it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some leukodystrophies have characteristic patterns of white matter involvement that can be seen on imaging. The relative sparing of the cerebellum and the thinning of the corpus callosum could be clues pointing towards a specific type of leukodystrophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are a type of fatty acid that, when elevated in the blood and tissues, can indicate certain peroxisomal disorders, specifically adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).\n",
      "\n",
      "ALD is a well-known leukodystrophy that primarily affects the white matter of the brain, often with a predilection for the parieto-occipital regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the question doesn't explicitly mention parieto-occipital involvement, the fact that it highlights the need to differentiate between toxic and hereditary leukoencephalopathies, coupled with the atypical imaging findings, makes ALD a key consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, testing for VLCFAs in the plasma is a crucial initial step. A positive result would strongly suggest ALD, prompting further genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis. A negative result would make a toxic etiology more likely, but would not completely rule out other leukodystrophies, necessitating further investigation.\n",

       "{'original': {'question': \"Dr. Matthew T. Bianchi\\n(Neurology): A 57-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of progressive cognitive decline. He had a history of recurrent malignant melanoma of the right conjunctiva and eyelid that was treated at this hospital. Nine days before admission, a nurse from the melanoma clinic who contacted him by telephone for a preappointment interview noted that he was incoherent and unable to answer her questions. Four days later, at a clinic visit, his physician noted that the patient had difficulty understanding the conversation. Options for treatment of the malignant melanoma, including orbital exenteration, were discussed with the patient and his wife.\\nThe next morning, at 3 a.m., his wife awoke to find the patient having convulsive movements in bed. The seizure lasted less than 5 minutes, after which he remained unresponsive. Emergency medical services providers were called; on their arrival 10 minutes later, he had regained consciousness but was incontinent of urine, disoriented, and unable to follow commands. He was transported to the emergency department of another hospital.\\nOn examination, the patient appeared confused. The vital signs were normal, and the oxygen saturation was 97% while he was breathing ambient air. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the fluid revealed no cells and normal levels of protein and glucose, no organisms were detected on Gram's and acid-fast staining, and polymerase-chain-reaction testing for JC virus was negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed generalized atrophy; there was no evidence of hemorrhage. An electroencephalogram showed diffuse theta-range background slowing but no epileptiform activity. He was admitted to the hospital. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T\\n2\\n-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain after the administration of gadolinium showed generalized brain atrophy and diffuse white-matter hyperintensity. Lorazepam, haloperidol, phenytoin, levetiracetam, acyclovir, and ceftriaxone were administered. His mental status deteriorated, and he became intermittently agitated. On the fifth day, he was transferred to this hospital.\\nOn further questioning at this hospital, the patient's wife reported that she had noticed occasional episodes of confusion and disorientation during the previous 5 years. During the previous 2 months, she had noticed a change in his behavior, with more frequent episodes of disorientation and progressive impairment in his memory, including forgetting to switch off electrical appliances and having difficulty making out checks and using the computer.\\nA diagnosis of malignant melanoma of the right eyelid had been made approximately 5 years earlier and was treated with excision; recurrent melanomas on the conjunctiva, lower eyelid, and lacrimal caruncle of the right eye were excised during the next 4 years, most recently 2 months before admission. At that time, CT of the head and chest showed no metastatic lesions. The patient had a history of head trauma and extradural hematoma in infancy and had had a left frontoparietal craniotomy, with no apparent residual cognitive deficit. He had emphysema, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression and had undergone bilateral lens implantations. He had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (diagnosed more than 15 years earlier) and had a serum HCV RNA level of 1.6 million IU per milliliter 1 month before admission.\\nThe patient was right-handed, lived with his wife, and had one adult daughter. He smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol socially. In the past, he had abused alcohol and taken cocaine, amphetamines, LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), and marijuana, as well as intravenous heroin, but he had not used illicit drugs for at least 10 years. He had been an average student and had left school at the age of 16 years to enter the workforce. At the time of hospital admission, he worked in an office position, but in past employment, he had been exposed to organic solvents, primarily industrial degreasers. His father died of kidney cancer, and his mother of colon cancer; one brother died at the age of 59 years of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and another brother died at the age of 15 years in a motor vehicle accident. There was no known family history of neurologic disease. He had no known allergies. Medications on admission included metoprolol, haloperidol, lorazepam, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, docusate, levetiracetam, and thiamine.\\nOn examination, the patient was disheveled, cachectic, and intermittently agitated. The temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 107 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was bald, the right eyelid was scarred, pigmented areas were noted on both irises, the mucous membranes were dry, and several teeth were missing. There were no dysmorphic features. Breath sounds were decreased at both lung bases. There was clubbing of the fingers, and there were multiple tattoos on the skin. Testing of the cranial nerves, motor and sensory systems, coordination, deep-tendon reflexes, plantar responses, and gait disclosed no abnormalities. There were bilateral grasp responses. He recognized his spouse and his caregivers, but he was not oriented to place or time. Simple attention was markedly impaired. He was restless and distracted and needed to be repeatedly redirected to tasks. He spoke continuously and intelligibly but with verbal perseveration. His speech was a fluent, meaningless stream of words, nonwords, and jargon. He could not name common objects, follow simple verbal commands, read, or write. More detailed cognitive testing was impossible because of deficits in attention and language.\\nA complete blood count was normal, as were levels of serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, bilirubin, and troponin T. Coagulation and renal-function tests also were normal. The alkaline phosphatase level was 130 U per liter (reference range, 45 to 115), the aspartate aminotransferase level 54 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), and the alanine aminotransferase level 67 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55). Testing of blood for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, rapid-plasma-reagin testing, and a paraneoplastic antibody panel were negative. A chest radiograph was normal.\\nOn the second hospital day, an electroencephalogram revealed generalized low-amplitude theta-range slowing without superimposed epileptiform activity. The patient's agitation decreased, and haloperidol was stopped. Electrocardiography disclosed first-degree atrioventricular block; metoprolol was stopped, and lisinopril was begun. MRI of the brain after the administration of gadolinium revealed generalized cerebral atrophy, more prominent in the left frontal lobe underlying the craniotomy site, with dilatation of the left lateral ventricle. FLAIR and T\\n2\\n-weighted MRI showed asymmetric hyperintensity within the occipitoparietal and posterior temporal subcortical deep and periventricular white matter, extending into the lateral aspects of the cerebral peduncles and sparing the corticospinal tracts; patchy enhancement was seen along the subcortical U-fibers in both parietal lobes, with relative sparing of the cerebellum and thinning of the corpus callosum. Magnetic resonance angiography showed no vascular occlusions or stenoses.\\nOn the fifth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed normal cell counts and normal protein and glucose levels; no organisms were evident on Gram's or acid-fast bacilli staining. Testing for antibodies to\\nBorrelia burgdorferi,\\nas well as\\nB. burgdorferi\\nDNA and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory tests were negative. A diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?\",\n",
       "  'reasoning': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\n*Dr. Daniel J. Costello:* I cared for this patient and am aware of the diagnosis. This 57-year-old man with previously stable cognition presented with a 2-month history of deteriorating intellectual function and behavior, which precipitously worsened after a seizure. In retrospect, he had shown intermittent signs of cognitive dysfunction during the preceding 5 years, suggesting an insidious onset of his disease. He had a history of substance abuse, occupational exposure to organic solvents, active HCV infection, and malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva of his right eye, thought to be at significant risk for dissemination. Examination revealed pronounced impairment in attention, language, comportment, and probably memory, which decreased his functional independence. The clinical scenario is that of rapidly progressive dementia, which is defined as a state of progressive, sustained impairment in multiple domains of cognitive function (usually but not always involving memory) occurring in clear consciousness that is sufficiently severe as to impede personal, social, or vocational functions. This is a common and challenging clinical problem, since there are many possible causes ([Table 1](#t01)), and prompt diagnosis is essential to determine whether it is treatable.This patient's dementia reflects dysfunction of diffuse cortical structures, subcortical structures, or both. He does not have characteristic clinical abnormalities associated with cerebral cortical dysfunction, such as aphasia, neglect, or apraxia. Impaired attention and forgetfulness, psychomotor slowing, impaired executive and visuospatial skills, change in personality, and emotional disturbance, many of which our patient had, raise the possibility of subcortical dementia due to white-matter disease. Seizures may occasionally occur in white-matter diseases.The investigative approach to a patient such as this with rapidly progressive dementia requires a thorough clinical history and physical examination and then laboratory tests as summarized in [Table 2](#t02). Testing for rare disorders such as inborn errors of metabolism is sometimes indicated. A brain biopsy is necessary in a small fraction of patients. In this patient, the results of the investigations listed in [Table 2](#t02) were normal, except for the results of liver-function tests (presumed to be abnormal because of chronic HCV infection) and the findings on electroencephalography.Dr. Grant, may we review the imaging studies?*Dr. P. Ellen Grant:* CT scanning of the brain ([Figure 1A](#f01)) revealed generalized atrophy and decreased attenuation in the peritrigonal regions. There was no evidence of hemorrhage. MRI of the brain ([Figure 1B](#f01)) revealed generalized brain atrophy and symmetric, confluent increased FLAIR and T2-weighted signal in the parietal and temporal lobes, in the posterior body and splenium of the corpus callosum, and in additional areas in the frontal lobes and the lateral midbrain ([Figure 1C](#f01)). Diffusion-weighted imaging (Fig. 1 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP3602171DC1), available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) shows peripheral linear areas of increased diffusion-weighted-imaging signal in the corpus callosum indicating an outer rim of decreased diffusion. After the administration of contrast material, an incomplete peripheral rim of enhancement was seen around the T2 signal abnormality that crossed through the corpus callosum ([Figure 1D](#f01)).*Dr. Costello:* The clinical presentation and imaging abnormalities led to a working diagnosis of a progressive white-matter disease, or leukoencephalopathy. Although the early signs of this disorder are subtle, advanced leukoencephalopathies are associated with progressive abulia, spasticity, frontal-release signs, incontinence, and the development of cortical signs. In the terminal stages, patients progress into a state of akinetic mutism, followed by stupor, coma, and death. This patient presented in the advanced stages of this clinical spectrum.The most useful diagnostic tool for determining the cause of primary white-matter disease is the pattern of white-matter changes on MRI. Symmetric white-matter changes, seen in this patient, are characteristic of disorders causing diffuse white-matter injury such as symmetrically infiltrative tumors, hereditary white-matter diseases, metabolic injury (anoxia, carbon monoxide poisoning, mitochondrial disorders), or exposure to a white-matter toxin; conversely, asymmetric or multifocal imaging patterns are more likely a result of vascularly mediated or inflammatory disorders or infections.\\n### Symmetric Leukoencephalopathy\\n\\nThe patient had active HCV infection, but active HCV infection, in the absence of secondary vasculitis or cryoglobulinemia, is not associated with progressive white-matter disease. He had a history of recurrent localized malignant melanoma, but there was no evidence of parenchymal metastases or leptomeningeal infiltration. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was unlikely, since the patient did not seem to be immunocompromised and did not display any cortical neurologic deficits, and the imaging abnormalities were not typical of that disorder. There were no clinical features suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder. There was no history of acute hypoxic injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, radiation therapy, or treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.\\n### Toxic Leukoencephalopathy\\n\\nThe patient had a history of exposure to a number of potential white-matter toxins, including alcohol, cocaine, heroin, and organic solvents, making toxic leukoencephalopathy a prime consideration.[1](#core-r001) Toxic leukoencephalopathies can manifest clinically at various intervals after exposure to a toxin.\\n### Substance Abuse\\n\\nThis patient had a history of heavy alcohol use. Although some neurologic syndromes are ascribed to chronic alcohol abuse,[2](#core-r002) the fulminant clinical deterioration in this patient, whose current alcohol intake was not excessive, in conjunction with the extensive white-matter abnormalities on MRI is not typical of these syndromes. Cocaine use may lead to cerebral infarcts caused by vasospasm or vasculitis, hemorrhage, seizures, and, in rare cases, a devastating acute toxic leukoencephalopathy.[3](#core-r003) These complications typically occur in patients with acute toxic effects from cocaine use. Cocaine overdose may lead to respiratory depression sufficiently severe to cause diffuse anoxic brain injury. It is not clear whether chronic cocaine use alone leads to a distinct toxic leukoencephalopathy.Inhalation of vaporized heroin (known as “chasing the dragon”) has been associated with a severe acute leukoencephalopathy resulting from extensive damage to white matter, the cerebellum, and basal ganglia,[4](#core-r004) possibly due to heroin pyrolysate.[5](#core-r005) Heroin leukoencephalopathy is less common with other modes of heroin use, but it has been described with intravenous use, usually in cases of overdose.[6](#core-r006) This patient had not used cocaine or vaporized heroin during the preceding decade, making cocaine-related or heroin-related leukoencephalopathy unlikely.\\n### Organic Solvents\\n\\nThis patient had handled degreasers and glues on a regular basis, making the possibility of leukoencephalopathy due to exposure to organic solvents (organic-solvent leukoencephalopathy) a prime consideration.[7](#core-r007) Chronic exposure to these highly lipophilic chemicals, either occupationally or through abuse, may disrupt the integrity of myelin and impair neural transmission, resulting in a toxic leukoencephalopathy.[8](#core-r008) These leukoencephalopathies generally occur after chronic, moderate-to-high-level exposure, and thus the time course in this case would be consistent with toxic leukoencephalopathy.\\n### Hereditary Leukodystrophies in Adulthood\\n\\nAlthough this patient had several risk factors for toxic leukoencephalopathy, the possibility of a hereditary white-matter disorder characterized by loss of myelin from white-matter tracts (leukodystrophy) first presenting in adulthood had to be considered.[9](#core-r009) The most common leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), may present in adults, and in this patient the bilateral posterior, symmetric, confluent white-matter signal abnormalities that became slightly enhanced after the administration of gadolinium are consistent with those described in cases of X-ALD. However, the fulminant deterioration, apparent absence of affected family members, and lack of spasticity and sphincter dysfunction are unusual. Metachromatic leukodystrophy may present in adulthood, often with variable combinations of cognitive, behavioral, and neuropsychiatric disturbances, peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy, and dystonia. Globoid-cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe's disease) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal-storage disorder that may rarely present in adulthood. Imaging abnormalities include a posterior leukoencephalopathy with involvement of the pyramidal tract and corpus callosum. Of the hereditary leukodystrophies, X-ALD is the most plausible, primarily because of the imaging findings, although the clinical presentation was unusual.\\n### Summary\\n\\nThe clinical history and physical examination, in conjunction with the imaging findings, suggest either a toxic leukoencephalopathy or a late presentation of hereditary leukodystrophy, in particular the cerebral form of X-ALD. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate quickly in this hospital. Because of his precipitous clinical decline and the lack of a diagnosis, a stereotactic biopsy was performed, during which a specimen of white matter was obtained from the right parietal region. The intention was to obtain samples from a radiologically abnormal area traversing both the rim of contrast enhancement and the underlying white matter that displayed abnormal signal changes.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\n*Dr. Pavan K. Auluck:* Microscopical examination of the biopsy specimen revealed slightly hypercellular, gliotic white matter with granular eosinophilic material ([Figure 2A](#f02)) and patchy loss of myelin ([Figure 2B](#f02)). The presence of granular eosinophilic material raised the suspicion of a storage disorder. Immunohistochemical analysis ([Figure 2C](#f02)) revealed a reduction in the number of axons within the areas of myelin loss. There were no nuclei with viral-type changes suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and immunostaining for the large T antigen (directed against epitopes shared by JC virus and simian virus 40 [SV40]) was negative. Numerous macrophages ([Figure 2D](#f02)) filled with granular periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)–positive, diastase-resistant material ([Figure 2E](#f02)) were located within perivascular spaces and scattered throughout the white matter.The differential diagnosis of PAS-positive macrophages within the brain is limited and includes Whipple's disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, globoid-cell leukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, acquired leukoencephalopathy due to toxins, and other hereditary leukodystrophies. In Whipple's disease, the macrophages are typically limited to perivascular spaces without parenchymal infiltration.Ultrastructural examination ([Figure 2F](#f02)) revealed that the macrophages contained numerous lamellar structures within membrane-bound organelles. No intracellular bacteria (expected in Whipple's disease) were identified. The ultrastructural evidence of membrane-bound lamellar material within macrophages leaves two possibilities: toxic and hereditary metabolic disorders. These neuropathological findings have been described in the context of exposure to organic solvents.[10](#core-r010) Among metabolic disorders, this constellation of findings can be seen in late-onset X-ALD[11–13](#core-r011) as well as in other genetic causes for which genes have not been identified.[14](#core-r014)\\n### X-ALD\\n\\n*Dr. Florian S. Eichler:* Once the diagnosis of X-ALD was suggested by the pattern of the brain MRI and the brain biopsy, targeted testing of specific organelle function (peroxisome, lysosome, and mitochondrion) was the next step. Very-long-chain fatty acids (more than 20 carbons) are degraded in the peroxisome, and therefore, disorders of the peroxisome such as X-ALD lead to the accumulation of these fatty acids in plasma.[15](#core-r015) In this case, testing revealed elevations in the plasma level of very-long-chain fatty acids ([Table 3](#t03)). The *ABCD1* gene on Xq28, which codes for the peroxisomal membrane protein (not an enzyme) ABCD1, a member of the family of proteins known as ATP-binding cassette transporters, is mutated in X-ALD[16,17](#core-r016) ([www.x-ald.nl](https://www.x-ald.nl)). The mechanisms by which the defect in the *ABCD1* gene leads to the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids and the associated phenotypic manifestation are poorly understood. In this patient, analysis of the mutation revealed a substitution of arginine by glutamine at amino acid residue 591, confirming the diagnosis of X-ALD. Further testing of cerebrospinal fluid for the DNA of *Tropheryma whipplei* (which causes Whipple's disease) and testing for *NOTCH3* mutations and a lysosomal-enzyme screen were normal.How unusual is this patient's presentation, and should this diagnosis be considered in all adults with progressive leukoencephalopathy, even those without a family history?[18](#core-r018) Leukodystrophies are characterized by normal early development, followed by loss of skills and regression as the myelin deteriorates. Approximately 35% of patients with X-ALD have the childhood cerebral form, with onset of dementia and adrenal insufficiency between 4 and 8 years of age. Seizures are uncommon but may occur. In another 35 to 40% of patients, the disorder presents in young adulthood as a slowly progressive paraparesis, with sphincter disturbances due to the involvement of long tracts in the spinal cord, referred to as adrenomyeloneuropathy. Rapidly progressive inflammatory demyelination develops in 20% of these patients, and they die in 1 to 2 years.[19,20](#core-r019)Several unusual features in this patient contributed to the delay in diagnosis. His advanced age at the onset of symptoms is uncommon for X-ALD, as is the rapid progression of cerebral disease. More important, he lacked a history of long-tract signs, and most adults with X-ALD have signs and symptoms of a myeloneuropathy by the time they are his age. In adults, cognitive abnormalities can manifest as neuropsychiatric symptoms, and substance abuse, which was a prominent feature of this patient's history, is not uncommon. However, his long history of drug abuse and exposure to environmental toxins further confounded the diagnostic workup, since it provided a more likely explanation for the onset of new symptoms at his age. An important issue for this patient is that the neuropathology of organic-solvent leukoencephalopathy can be indistinguishable from that of cerebral X-ALD on examination of biopsy specimens.[10](#core-r010) In organic-solvent leukoencephalopathy, very-long-chain fatty acids also accumulate in the brain, and the findings of lamellar inclusions in both disorders may reflect this fact. However, the accumulation of these fatty acids in plasma is seen only in cases of X-ALD. Furthermore, the lack of an obvious family history in this case decreased the suspicion for a heritable neurologic disease.Currently, approximately 2000 patients in the United States have been diagnosed with X-ALD as a result of plasma testing of very-long-chain fatty acids.[21](#core-r021) Unfortunately, many adults with leukodystrophies remain undiagnosed, in part because their symptoms are attributed to substance abuse or other disorders such as multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia.\\n\\nDiscussion of Management\\n------------------------\\n\\n*Dr. Eichler:* General supportive care and symptomatic treatment for the patient and his family are crucial. Specialist consultation, nursing, schools, rehabilitation, and social agencies are the cornerstones of the care and treatment of patients with X-ALD. Current medical therapies for patients with X-ALD include hormone-replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency, dietary therapy with Lorenzo's oil (a combination of oleic acid and erucic acid), and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.[22](#core-r022) Other approaches are still under investigation.This patient had no signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, and a corticotropin stimulation test was normal, but continued vigilance is necessary. Physical stress and minor illnesses can be detrimental to patients who have adrenoleukodystrophy with adrenal insufficiency. Dietary therapy and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation are beneficial only for patients who are asymptomatic or in the early stages of the illness.[22,23](#core-r022) Unfortunately, this patient's condition, like that of more than half of patients with cerebral involvement, was too advanced to benefit from currently available therapies.Further questioning of family members revealed that a maternal male cousin had spent many years in a wheelchair; he may have had X-ALD. More important, the patient's daughter was an obligate carrier of the mutation, and her 4-year-old son had an elevated level of very-long-chain fatty acids. He currently has no symptoms and a brain MRI was normal, but he carries a 35% risk of the development of a devastating inflammatory demyelination in the next 6 years. He has been placed on Lorenzo's oil to lower the level of the fatty acids and will receive brain MRIs annually.In hindsight, there are several lessons to be learned from this case. First, genetic and metabolic markers are useful in the workup of neurologic decline not only in children but also in adults. In addition, a history of drug abuse should not sway one from considering genetic causes of neurologic symptoms. This case reminds us that genetic disorders may present in adulthood. In retrospect, this patient's MRI findings are typical of X-ALD, but this possibility was not seriously considered because of the patient's age and other risk factors for leukoencephalopathy. Screening for genetic disorders, including testing for levels of very-long-chain fatty acids, could prevent the performance of unnecessary brain biopsies in a subgroup of adult patients presenting with cognitive decline. Finally, establishing the diagnosis of a neurogenetic disorder allows for family screening and identification of at-risk family members.*Dr. Costello:* The patient's deterioration continued relentlessly and progressed toward a state of akinetic mutism. He died of bronchopneumonia 10 months after his original clinical presentation.\\n\",\n",

       "   'question': \"Dr. Matthew T. Bianchi\\n(Neurology): A 57-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of progressive cognitive decline. He had a history of recurrent malignant melanoma of the right conjunctiva and eyelid that was treated at this hospital. Nine days before admission, a nurse from the melanoma clinic who contacted him by telephone for a preappointment interview noted that he was incoherent and unable to answer her questions. Four days later, at a clinic visit, his physician noted that the patient had difficulty understanding the conversation. Options for treatment of the malignant melanoma, including orbital exenteration, were discussed with the patient and his wife.\\nThe next morning, at 3 a.m., his wife awoke to find the patient having convulsive movements in bed. The seizure lasted less than 5 minutes, after which he remained unresponsive. Emergency medical services providers were called; on their arrival 10 minutes later, he had regained consciousness but was incontinent of urine, disoriented, and unable to follow commands. He was transported to the emergency department of another hospital.\\nOn examination, the patient appeared confused. The vital signs were normal, and the oxygen saturation was 97% while he was breathing ambient air. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the fluid revealed no cells and normal levels of protein and glucose, no organisms were detected on Gram's and acid-fast staining, and polymerase-chain-reaction testing for JC virus was negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed generalized atrophy; there was no evidence of hemorrhage. An electroencephalogram showed diffuse theta-range background slowing but no epileptiform activity. He was admitted to the hospital. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T\\n2\\n-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain after the administration of gadolinium showed generalized brain atrophy and diffuse white-matter hyperintensity. Lorazepam, haloperidol, phenytoin, levetiracetam, acyclovir, and ceftriaxone were administered. His mental status deteriorated, and he became intermittently agitated. On the fifth day, he was transferred to this hospital.\\nOn further questioning at this hospital, the patient's wife reported that she had noticed occasional episodes of confusion and disorientation during the previous 5 years. During the previous 2 months, she had noticed a change in his behavior, with more frequent episodes of disorientation and progressive impairment in his memory, including forgetting to switch off electrical appliances and having difficulty making out checks and using the computer.\\nA diagnosis of malignant melanoma of the right eyelid had been made approximately 5 years earlier and was treated with excision; recurrent melanomas on the conjunctiva, lower eyelid, and lacrimal caruncle of the right eye were excised during the next 4 years, most recently 2 months before admission. At that time, CT of the head and chest showed no metastatic lesions. The patient had a history of head trauma and extradural hematoma in infancy and had had a left frontoparietal craniotomy, with no apparent residual cognitive deficit. He had emphysema, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression and had undergone bilateral lens implantations. He had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (diagnosed more than 15 years earlier) and had a serum HCV RNA level of 1.6 million IU per milliliter 1 month before admission.\\nThe patient was right-handed, lived with his wife, and had one adult daughter. He smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol socially. In the past, he had abused alcohol and taken cocaine, amphetamines, LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), and marijuana, as well as intravenous heroin, but he had not used illicit drugs for at least 10 years. He had been an average student and had left school at the age of 16 years to enter the workforce. At the time of hospital admission, he worked in an office position, but in past employment, he had been exposed to organic solvents, primarily industrial degreasers. His father died of kidney cancer, and his mother of colon cancer; one brother died at the age of 59 years of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and another brother died at the age of 15 years in a motor vehicle accident. There was no known family history of neurologic disease. He had no known allergies. Medications on admission included metoprolol, haloperidol, lorazepam, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, docusate, levetiracetam, and thiamine.\\nOn examination, the patient was disheveled, cachectic, and intermittently agitated. The temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 107 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was bald, the right eyelid was scarred, pigmented areas were noted on both irises, the mucous membranes were dry, and several teeth were missing. There were no dysmorphic features. Breath sounds were decreased at both lung bases. There was clubbing of the fingers, and there were multiple tattoos on the skin. Testing of the cranial nerves, motor and sensory systems, coordination, deep-tendon reflexes, plantar responses, and gait disclosed no abnormalities. There were bilateral grasp responses. He recognized his spouse and his caregivers, but he was not oriented to place or time. Simple attention was markedly impaired. He was restless and distracted and needed to be repeatedly redirected to tasks. He spoke continuously and intelligibly but with verbal perseveration. His speech was a fluent, meaningless stream of words, nonwords, and jargon. He could not name common objects, follow simple verbal commands, read, or write. More detailed cognitive testing was impossible because of deficits in attention and language.\\nA complete blood count was normal, as were levels of serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, bilirubin, and troponin T. Coagulation and renal-function tests also were normal. The alkaline phosphatase level was 130 U per liter (reference range, 45 to 115), the aspartate aminotransferase level 54 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), and the alanine aminotransferase level 67 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55). Testing of blood for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, rapid-plasma-reagin testing, and a paraneoplastic antibody panel were negative. A chest radiograph was normal.\\nOn the second hospital day, an electroencephalogram revealed generalized low-amplitude theta-range slowing without superimposed epileptiform activity. The patient's agitation decreased, and haloperidol was stopped. Electrocardiography disclosed first-degree atrioventricular block; metoprolol was stopped, and lisinopril was begun. MRI of the brain after the administration of gadolinium revealed generalized cerebral atrophy, more prominent in the left frontal lobe underlying the craniotomy site, with dilatation of the left lateral ventricle. FLAIR and T\\n2\\n-weighted MRI showed asymmetric hyperintensity within the occipitoparietal and posterior temporal subcortical deep and periventricular white matter, extending into the lateral aspects of the cerebral peduncles and sparing the corticospinal tracts; patchy enhancement was seen along the subcortical U-fibers in both parietal lobes, with relative sparing of the cerebellum and thinning of the corpus callosum. Magnetic resonance angiography showed no vascular occlusions or stenoses.\\nOn the fifth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed normal cell counts and normal protein and glucose levels; no organisms were evident on Gram's or acid-fast bacilli staining. Testing for antibodies to\\nBorrelia burgdorferi,\\nas well as\\nB. burgdorferi\\nDNA and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory tests were negative. A diagnostic procedure was performed.\",\n",
       "   'reasoning': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\n*Dr. Daniel J. Costello:* I cared for this patient and am aware of the diagnosis. This 57-year-old man with previously stable cognition presented with a 2-month history of deteriorating intellectual function and behavior, which precipitously worsened after a seizure. In retrospect, he had shown intermittent signs of cognitive dysfunction during the preceding 5 years, suggesting an insidious onset of his disease. He had a history of substance abuse, occupational exposure to organic solvents, active HCV infection, and malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva of his right eye, thought to be at significant risk for dissemination. Examination revealed pronounced impairment in attention, language, comportment, and probably memory, which decreased his functional independence. The clinical scenario is that of rapidly progressive dementia, which is defined as a state of progressive, sustained impairment in multiple domains of cognitive function (usually but not always involving memory) occurring in clear consciousness that is sufficiently severe as to impede personal, social, or vocational functions. This is a common and challenging clinical problem, since there are many possible causes ([Table 1](#t01)), and prompt diagnosis is essential to determine whether it is treatable.This patient's dementia reflects dysfunction of diffuse cortical structures, subcortical structures, or both. He does not have characteristic clinical abnormalities associated with cerebral cortical dysfunction, such as aphasia, neglect, or apraxia. Impaired attention and forgetfulness, psychomotor slowing, impaired executive and visuospatial skills, change in personality, and emotional disturbance, many of which our patient had, raise the possibility of subcortical dementia due to white-matter disease. Seizures may occasionally occur in white-matter diseases.The investigative approach to a patient such as this with rapidly progressive dementia requires a thorough clinical history and physical examination and then laboratory tests as summarized in [Table 2](#t02). Testing for rare disorders such as inborn errors of metabolism is sometimes indicated. A brain biopsy is necessary in a small fraction of patients. In this patient, the results of the investigations listed in [Table 2](#t02) were normal, except for the results of liver-function tests (presumed to be abnormal because of chronic HCV infection) and the findings on electroencephalography.Dr. Grant, may we review the imaging studies?*Dr. P. Ellen Grant:* CT scanning of the brain ([Figure 1A](#f01)) revealed generalized atrophy and decreased attenuation in the peritrigonal regions. There was no evidence of hemorrhage. MRI of the brain ([Figure 1B](#f01)) revealed generalized brain atrophy and symmetric, confluent increased FLAIR and T2-weighted signal in the parietal and temporal lobes, in the posterior body and splenium of the corpus callosum, and in additional areas in the frontal lobes and the lateral midbrain ([Figure 1C](#f01)). Diffusion-weighted imaging (Fig. 1 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP3602171DC1), available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) shows peripheral linear areas of increased diffusion-weighted-imaging signal in the corpus callosum indicating an outer rim of decreased diffusion. After the administration of contrast material, an incomplete peripheral rim of enhancement was seen around the T2 signal abnormality that crossed through the corpus callosum ([Figure 1D](#f01)).*Dr. Costello:* The clinical presentation and imaging abnormalities led to a working diagnosis of a progressive white-matter disease, or leukoencephalopathy. Although the early signs of this disorder are subtle, advanced leukoencephalopathies are associated with progressive abulia, spasticity, frontal-release signs, incontinence, and the development of cortical signs. In the terminal stages, patients progress into a state of akinetic mutism, followed by stupor, coma, and death. This patient presented in the advanced stages of this clinical spectrum.The most useful diagnostic tool for determining the cause of primary white-matter disease is the pattern of white-matter changes on MRI. Symmetric white-matter changes, seen in this patient, are characteristic of disorders causing diffuse white-matter injury such as symmetrically infiltrative tumors, hereditary white-matter diseases, metabolic injury (anoxia, carbon monoxide poisoning, mitochondrial disorders), or exposure to a white-matter toxin; conversely, asymmetric or multifocal imaging patterns are more likely a result of vascularly mediated or inflammatory disorders or infections.\\n### Symmetric Leukoencephalopathy\\n\\nThe patient had active HCV infection, but active HCV infection, in the absence of secondary vasculitis or cryoglobulinemia, is not associated with progressive white-matter disease. He had a history of recurrent localized malignant melanoma, but there was no evidence of parenchymal metastases or leptomeningeal infiltration. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was unlikely, since the patient did not seem to be immunocompromised and did not display any cortical neurologic deficits, and the imaging abnormalities were not typical of that disorder. There were no clinical features suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder. There was no history of acute hypoxic injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, radiation therapy, or treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.\\n### Toxic Leukoencephalopathy\\n\\nThe patient had a history of exposure to a number of potential white-matter toxins, including alcohol, cocaine, heroin, and organic solvents, making toxic leukoencephalopathy a prime consideration.[1](#core-r001) Toxic leukoencephalopathies can manifest clinically at various intervals after exposure to a toxin.\\n### Substance Abuse\\n\\nThis patient had a history of heavy alcohol use. Although some neurologic syndromes are ascribed to chronic alcohol abuse,[2](#core-r002) the fulminant clinical deterioration in this patient, whose current alcohol intake was not excessive, in conjunction with the extensive white-matter abnormalities on MRI is not typical of these syndromes. Cocaine use may lead to cerebral infarcts caused by vasospasm or vasculitis, hemorrhage, seizures, and, in rare cases, a devastating acute toxic leukoencephalopathy.[3](#core-r003) These complications typically occur in patients with acute toxic effects from cocaine use. Cocaine overdose may lead to respiratory depression sufficiently severe to cause diffuse anoxic brain injury. It is not clear whether chronic cocaine use alone leads to a distinct toxic leukoencephalopathy.Inhalation of vaporized heroin (known as “chasing the dragon”) has been associated with a severe acute leukoencephalopathy resulting from extensive damage to white matter, the cerebellum, and basal ganglia,[4](#core-r004) possibly due to heroin pyrolysate.[5](#core-r005) Heroin leukoencephalopathy is less common with other modes of heroin use, but it has been described with intravenous use, usually in cases of overdose.[6](#core-r006) This patient had not used cocaine or vaporized heroin during the preceding decade, making cocaine-related or heroin-related leukoencephalopathy unlikely.\\n### Organic Solvents\\n\\nThis patient had handled degreasers and glues on a regular basis, making the possibility of leukoencephalopathy due to exposure to organic solvents (organic-solvent leukoencephalopathy) a prime consideration.[7](#core-r007) Chronic exposure to these highly lipophilic chemicals, either occupationally or through abuse, may disrupt the integrity of myelin and impair neural transmission, resulting in a toxic leukoencephalopathy.[8](#core-r008) These leukoencephalopathies generally occur after chronic, moderate-to-high-level exposure, and thus the time course in this case would be consistent with toxic leukoencephalopathy.\\n### Hereditary Leukodystrophies in Adulthood\\n\\nAlthough this patient had several risk factors for toxic leukoencephalopathy, the possibility of a hereditary white-matter disorder characterized by loss of myelin from white-matter tracts (leukodystrophy) first presenting in adulthood had to be considered.[9](#core-r009) The most common leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), may present in adults, and in this patient the bilateral posterior, symmetric, confluent white-matter signal abnormalities that became slightly enhanced after the administration of gadolinium are consistent with those described in cases of X-ALD. However, the fulminant deterioration, apparent absence of affected family members, and lack of spasticity and sphincter dysfunction are unusual. Metachromatic leukodystrophy may present in adulthood, often with variable combinations of cognitive, behavioral, and neuropsychiatric disturbances, peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy, and dystonia. Globoid-cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe's disease) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal-storage disorder that may rarely present in adulthood. Imaging abnormalities include a posterior leukoencephalopathy with involvement of the pyramidal tract and corpus callosum. Of the hereditary leukodystrophies, X-ALD is the most plausible, primarily because of the imaging findings, although the clinical presentation was unusual.\\n### Summary\\n\\nThe clinical history and physical examination, in conjunction with the imaging findings, suggest either a toxic leukoencephalopathy or a late presentation of hereditary leukodystrophy, in particular the cerebral form of X-ALD. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate quickly in this hospital. Because of his precipitous clinical decline and the lack of a diagnosis, a stereotactic biopsy was performed, during which a specimen of white matter was obtained from the right parietal region. The intention was to obtain samples from a radiologically abnormal area traversing both the rim of contrast enhancement and the underlying white matter that displayed abnormal signal changes.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\n*Dr. Pavan K. Auluck:* Microscopical examination of the biopsy specimen revealed slightly hypercellular, gliotic white matter with granular eosinophilic material ([Figure 2A](#f02)) and patchy loss of myelin ([Figure 2B](#f02)). The presence of granular eosinophilic material raised the suspicion of a storage disorder. Immunohistochemical analysis ([Figure 2C](#f02)) revealed a reduction in the number of axons within the areas of myelin loss. There were no nuclei with viral-type changes suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and immunostaining for the large T antigen (directed against epitopes shared by JC virus and simian virus 40 [SV40]) was negative. Numerous macrophages ([Figure 2D](#f02)) filled with granular periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)–positive, diastase-resistant material ([Figure 2E](#f02)) were located within perivascular spaces and scattered throughout the white matter.The differential diagnosis of PAS-positive macrophages within the brain is limited and includes Whipple's disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, globoid-cell leukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, acquired leukoencephalopathy due to toxins, and other hereditary leukodystrophies. In Whipple's disease, the macrophages are typically limited to perivascular spaces without parenchymal infiltration.Ultrastructural examination ([Figure 2F](#f02)) revealed that the macrophages contained numerous lamellar structures within membrane-bound organelles. No intracellular bacteria (expected in Whipple's disease) were identified. The ultrastructural evidence of membrane-bound lamellar material within macrophages leaves two possibilities: toxic and hereditary metabolic disorders. These neuropathological findings have been described in the context of exposure to organic solvents.[10](#core-r010) Among metabolic disorders, this constellation of findings can be seen in late-onset X-ALD[11–13](#core-r011) as well as in other genetic causes for which genes have not been identified.[14](#core-r014)\\n### X-ALD\\n\\n*Dr. Florian S. Eichler:* Once the diagnosis of X-ALD was suggested by the pattern of the brain MRI and the brain biopsy, targeted testing of specific organelle function (peroxisome, lysosome, and mitochondrion) was the next step. Very-long-chain fatty acids (more than 20 carbons) are degraded in the peroxisome, and therefore, disorders of the peroxisome such as X-ALD lead to the accumulation of these fatty acids in plasma.[15](#core-r015) In this case, testing revealed elevations in the plasma level of very-long-chain fatty acids ([Table 3](#t03)). The *ABCD1* gene on Xq28, which codes for the peroxisomal membrane protein (not an enzyme) ABCD1, a member of the family of proteins known as ATP-binding cassette transporters, is mutated in X-ALD[16,17](#core-r016) ([www.x-ald.nl](https://www.x-ald.nl)). The mechanisms by which the defect in the *ABCD1* gene leads to the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids and the associated phenotypic manifestation are poorly understood. In this patient, analysis of the mutation revealed a substitution of arginine by glutamine at amino acid residue 591, confirming the diagnosis of X-ALD. Further testing of cerebrospinal fluid for the DNA of *Tropheryma whipplei* (which causes Whipple's disease) and testing for *NOTCH3* mutations and a lysosomal-enzyme screen were normal.How unusual is this patient's presentation, and should this diagnosis be considered in all adults with progressive leukoencephalopathy, even those without a family history?[18](#core-r018) Leukodystrophies are characterized by normal early development, followed by loss of skills and regression as the myelin deteriorates. Approximately 35% of patients with X-ALD have the childhood cerebral form, with onset of dementia and adrenal insufficiency between 4 and 8 years of age. Seizures are uncommon but may occur. In another 35 to 40% of patients, the disorder presents in young adulthood as a slowly progressive paraparesis, with sphincter disturbances due to the involvement of long tracts in the spinal cord, referred to as adrenomyeloneuropathy. Rapidly progressive inflammatory demyelination develops in 20% of these patients, and they die in 1 to 2 years.[19,20](#core-r019)Several unusual features in this patient contributed to the delay in diagnosis. His advanced age at the onset of symptoms is uncommon for X-ALD, as is the rapid progression of cerebral disease. More important, he lacked a history of long-tract signs, and most adults with X-ALD have signs and symptoms of a myeloneuropathy by the time they are his age. In adults, cognitive abnormalities can manifest as neuropsychiatric symptoms, and substance abuse, which was a prominent feature of this patient's history, is not uncommon. However, his long history of drug abuse and exposure to environmental toxins further confounded the diagnostic workup, since it provided a more likely explanation for the onset of new symptoms at his age. An important issue for this patient is that the neuropathology of organic-solvent leukoencephalopathy can be indistinguishable from that of cerebral X-ALD on examination of biopsy specimens.[10](#core-r010) In organic-solvent leukoencephalopathy, very-long-chain fatty acids also accumulate in the brain, and the findings of lamellar inclusions in both disorders may reflect this fact. However, the accumulation of these fatty acids in plasma is seen only in cases of X-ALD. Furthermore, the lack of an obvious family history in this case decreased the suspicion for a heritable neurologic disease.Currently, approximately 2000 patients in the United States have been diagnosed with X-ALD as a result of plasma testing of very-long-chain fatty acids.[21](#core-r021) Unfortunately, many adults with leukodystrophies remain undiagnosed, in part because their symptoms are attributed to substance abuse or other disorders such as multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia.\\n\\nDiscussion of Management\\n------------------------\\n\\n*Dr. Eichler:* General supportive care and symptomatic treatment for the patient and his family are crucial. Specialist consultation, nursing, schools, rehabilitation, and social agencies are the cornerstones of the care and treatment of patients with X-ALD. Current medical therapies for patients with X-ALD include hormone-replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency, dietary therapy with Lorenzo's oil (a combination of oleic acid and erucic acid), and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.[22](#core-r022) Other approaches are still under investigation.This patient had no signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, and a corticotropin stimulation test was normal, but continued vigilance is necessary. Physical stress and minor illnesses can be detrimental to patients who have adrenoleukodystrophy with adrenal insufficiency. Dietary therapy and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation are beneficial only for patients who are asymptomatic or in the early stages of the illness.[22,23](#core-r022) Unfortunately, this patient's condition, like that of more than half of patients with cerebral involvement, was too advanced to benefit from currently available therapies.Further questioning of family members revealed that a maternal male cousin had spent many years in a wheelchair; he may have had X-ALD. More important, the patient's daughter was an obligate carrier of the mutation, and her 4-year-old son had an elevated level of very-long-chain fatty acids. He currently has no symptoms and a brain MRI was normal, but he carries a 35% risk of the development of a devastating inflammatory demyelination in the next 6 years. He has been placed on Lorenzo's oil to lower the level of the fatty acids and will receive brain MRIs annually.In hindsight, there are several lessons to be learned from this case. First, genetic and metabolic markers are useful in the workup of neurologic decline not only in children but also in adults. In addition, a history of drug abuse should not sway one from considering genetic causes of neurologic symptoms. This case reminds us that genetic disorders may present in adulthood. In retrospect, this patient's MRI findings are typical of X-ALD, but this possibility was not seriously considered because of the patient's age and other risk factors for leukoencephalopathy. Screening for genetic disorders, including testing for levels of very-long-chain fatty acids, could prevent the performance of unnecessary brain biopsies in a subgroup of adult patients presenting with cognitive decline. Finally, establishing the diagnosis of a neurogenetic disorder allows for family screening and identification of at-risk family members.*Dr. Costello:* The patient's deterioration continued relentlessly and progressed toward a state of akinetic mutism. He died of bronchopneumonia 10 months after his original clinical presentation.\\n\",\n",

       "   'question': \"A 57-year-old man with a history of recurrent malignant melanoma, remote head trauma with craniotomy, emphysema, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, HCV infection, and past substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, LSD, marijuana) presents with a 2-month history of progressive cognitive decline, including disorientation, memory impairment, and behavioral changes, culminating in a seizure. Initial workup at an outside hospital revealed generalized brain atrophy on CT, diffuse theta-range slowing on EEG, and diffuse white-matter hyperintensity on FLAIR and T2-weighted MRI. Examination reveals marked impairment in attention and language, with fluent but meaningless speech and inability to follow commands. MRI shows generalized cerebral atrophy, asymmetric hyperintensity within the occipitoparietal and posterior temporal subcortical deep and periventricular white matter extending into the lateral aspects of the cerebral peduncles, patchy enhancement along the subcortical U-fibers in both parietal lobes, relative sparing of the cerebellum, and thinning of the corpus callosum. Magnetic resonance angiography shows no vascular occlusions or stenoses. Given these findings, and the patient's history of occupational exposure to organic solvents, what specific diagnostic test is most critical to differentiate between toxic leukoencephalopathy due to organic solvents and a hereditary leukodystrophy?\",\n",
       "   'reasoning': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\n*Dr. Daniel J. Costello:* I cared for this patient and am aware of the diagnosis. This 57-year-old man with previously stable cognition presented with a 2-month history of deteriorating intellectual function and behavior, which precipitously worsened after a seizure. In retrospect, he had shown intermittent signs of cognitive dysfunction during the preceding 5 years, suggesting an insidious onset of his disease. He had a history of substance abuse, occupational exposure to organic solvents, active HCV infection, and malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva of his right eye, thought to be at significant risk for dissemination. Examination revealed pronounced impairment in attention, language, comportment, and probably memory, which decreased his functional independence. The clinical scenario is that of rapidly progressive dementia, which is defined as a state of progressive, sustained impairment in multiple domains of cognitive function (usually but not always involving memory) occurring in clear consciousness that is sufficiently severe as to impede personal, social, or vocational functions. This is a common and challenging clinical problem, since there are many possible causes ([Table 1](#t01)), and prompt diagnosis is essential to determine whether it is treatable.This patient's dementia reflects dysfunction of diffuse cortical structures, subcortical structures, or both. He does not have characteristic clinical abnormalities associated with cerebral cortical dysfunction, such as aphasia, neglect, or apraxia. Impaired attention and forgetfulness, psychomotor slowing, impaired executive and visuospatial skills, change in personality, and emotional disturbance, many of which our patient had, raise the possibility of subcortical dementia due to white-matter disease. Seizures may occasionally occur in white-matter diseases.The investigative approach to a patient such as this with rapidly progressive dementia requires a thorough clinical history and physical examination and then laboratory tests as summarized in [Table 2](#t02). Testing for rare disorders such as inborn errors of metabolism is sometimes indicated. A brain biopsy is necessary in a small fraction of patients. In this patient, the results of the investigations listed in [Table 2](#t02) were normal, except for the results of liver-function tests (presumed to be abnormal because of chronic HCV infection) and the findings on electroencephalography.Dr. Grant, may we review the imaging studies?*Dr. P. Ellen Grant:* CT scanning of the brain ([Figure 1A](#f01)) revealed generalized atrophy and decreased attenuation in the peritrigonal regions. There was no evidence of hemorrhage. MRI of the brain ([Figure 1B](#f01)) revealed generalized brain atrophy and symmetric, confluent increased FLAIR and T2-weighted signal in the parietal and temporal lobes, in the posterior body and splenium of the corpus callosum, and in additional areas in the frontal lobes and the lateral midbrain ([Figure 1C](#f01)). Diffusion-weighted imaging (Fig. 1 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#APP3602171DC1), available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) shows peripheral linear areas of increased diffusion-weighted-imaging signal in the corpus callosum indicating an outer rim of decreased diffusion. After the administration of contrast material, an incomplete peripheral rim of enhancement was seen around the T2 signal abnormality that crossed through the corpus callosum ([Figure 1D](#f01)).*Dr. Costello:* The clinical presentation and imaging abnormalities led to a working diagnosis of a progressive white-matter disease, or leukoencephalopathy. Although the early signs of this disorder are subtle, advanced leukoencephalopathies are associated with progressive abulia, spasticity, frontal-release signs, incontinence, and the development of cortical signs. In the terminal stages, patients progress into a state of akinetic mutism, followed by stupor, coma, and death. This patient presented in the advanced stages of this clinical spectrum.The most useful diagnostic tool for determining the cause of primary white-matter disease is the pattern of white-matter changes on MRI. Symmetric white-matter changes, seen in this patient, are characteristic of disorders causing diffuse white-matter injury such as symmetrically infiltrative tumors, hereditary white-matter diseases, metabolic injury (anoxia, carbon monoxide poisoning, mitochondrial disorders), or exposure to a white-matter toxin; conversely, asymmetric or multifocal imaging patterns are more likely a result of vascularly mediated or inflammatory disorders or infections.\\n### Symmetric Leukoencephalopathy\\n\\nThe patient had active HCV infection, but active HCV infection, in the absence of secondary vasculitis or cryoglobulinemia, is not associated with progressive white-matter disease. He had a history of recurrent localized malignant melanoma, but there was no evidence of parenchymal metastases or leptomeningeal infiltration. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was unlikely, since the patient did not seem to be immunocompromised and did not display any cortical neurologic deficits, and the imaging abnormalities were not typical of that disorder. There were no clinical features suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder. There was no history of acute hypoxic injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, radiation therapy, or treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.\\n### Toxic Leukoencephalopathy\\n\\nThe patient had a history of exposure to a number of potential white-matter toxins, including alcohol, cocaine, heroin, and organic solvents, making toxic leukoencephalopathy a prime consideration.[1](#core-r001) Toxic leukoencephalopathies can manifest clinically at various intervals after exposure to a toxin.\\n### Substance Abuse\\n\\nThis patient had a history of heavy alcohol use. Although some neurologic syndromes are ascribed to chronic alcohol abuse,[2](#core-r002) the fulminant clinical deterioration in this patient, whose current alcohol intake was not excessive, in conjunction with the extensive white-matter abnormalities on MRI is not typical of these syndromes. Cocaine use may lead to cerebral infarcts caused by vasospasm or vasculitis, hemorrhage, seizures, and, in rare cases, a devastating acute toxic leukoencephalopathy.[3](#core-r003) These complications typically occur in patients with acute toxic effects from cocaine use. Cocaine overdose may lead to respiratory depression sufficiently severe to cause diffuse anoxic brain injury. It is not clear whether chronic cocaine use alone leads to a distinct toxic leukoencephalopathy.Inhalation of vaporized heroin (known as “chasing the dragon”) has been associated with a severe acute leukoencephalopathy resulting from extensive damage to white matter, the cerebellum, and basal ganglia,[4](#core-r004) possibly due to heroin pyrolysate.[5](#core-r005) Heroin leukoencephalopathy is less common with other modes of heroin use, but it has been described with intravenous use, usually in cases of overdose.[6](#core-r006) This patient had not used cocaine or vaporized heroin during the preceding decade, making cocaine-related or heroin-related leukoencephalopathy unlikely.\\n### Organic Solvents\\n\\nThis patient had handled degreasers and glues on a regular basis, making the possibility of leukoencephalopathy due to exposure to organic solvents (organic-solvent leukoencephalopathy) a prime consideration.[7](#core-r007) Chronic exposure to these highly lipophilic chemicals, either occupationally or through abuse, may disrupt the integrity of myelin and impair neural transmission, resulting in a toxic leukoencephalopathy.[8](#core-r008) These leukoencephalopathies generally occur after chronic, moderate-to-high-level exposure, and thus the time course in this case would be consistent with toxic leukoencephalopathy.\\n### Hereditary Leukodystrophies in Adulthood\\n\\nAlthough this patient had several risk factors for toxic leukoencephalopathy, the possibility of a hereditary white-matter disorder characterized by loss of myelin from white-matter tracts (leukodystrophy) first presenting in adulthood had to be considered.[9](#core-r009) The most common leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), may present in adults, and in this patient the bilateral posterior, symmetric, confluent white-matter signal abnormalities that became slightly enhanced after the administration of gadolinium are consistent with those described in cases of X-ALD. However, the fulminant deterioration, apparent absence of affected family members, and lack of spasticity and sphincter dysfunction are unusual. Metachromatic leukodystrophy may present in adulthood, often with variable combinations of cognitive, behavioral, and neuropsychiatric disturbances, peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy, and dystonia. Globoid-cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe's disease) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal-storage disorder that may rarely present in adulthood. Imaging abnormalities include a posterior leukoencephalopathy with involvement of the pyramidal tract and corpus callosum. Of the hereditary leukodystrophies, X-ALD is the most plausible, primarily because of the imaging findings, although the clinical presentation was unusual.\\n### Summary\\n\\nThe clinical history and physical examination, in conjunction with the imaging findings, suggest either a toxic leukoencephalopathy or a late presentation of hereditary leukodystrophy, in particular the cerebral form of X-ALD. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate quickly in this hospital. Because of his precipitous clinical decline and the lack of a diagnosis, a stereotactic biopsy was performed, during which a specimen of white matter was obtained from the right parietal region. The intention was to obtain samples from a radiologically abnormal area traversing both the rim of contrast enhancement and the underlying white matter that displayed abnormal signal changes.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\n*Dr. Pavan K. Auluck:* Microscopical examination of the biopsy specimen revealed slightly hypercellular, gliotic white matter with granular eosinophilic material ([Figure 2A](#f02)) and patchy loss of myelin ([Figure 2B](#f02)). The presence of granular eosinophilic material raised the suspicion of a storage disorder. Immunohistochemical analysis ([Figure 2C](#f02)) revealed a reduction in the number of axons within the areas of myelin loss. There were no nuclei with viral-type changes suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and immunostaining for the large T antigen (directed against epitopes shared by JC virus and simian virus 40 [SV40]) was negative. Numerous macrophages ([Figure 2D](#f02)) filled with granular periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)–positive, diastase-resistant material ([Figure 2E](#f02)) were located within perivascular spaces and scattered throughout the white matter.The differential diagnosis of PAS-positive macrophages within the brain is limited and includes Whipple's disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, globoid-cell leukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, acquired leukoencephalopathy due to toxins, and other hereditary leukodystrophies. In Whipple's disease, the macrophages are typically limited to perivascular spaces without parenchymal infiltration.Ultrastructural examination ([Figure 2F](#f02)) revealed that the macrophages contained numerous lamellar structures within membrane-bound organelles. No intracellular bacteria (expected in Whipple's disease) were identified. The ultrastructural evidence of membrane-bound lamellar material within macrophages leaves two possibilities: toxic and hereditary metabolic disorders. These neuropathological findings have been described in the context of exposure to organic solvents.[10](#core-r010) Among metabolic disorders, this constellation of findings can be seen in late-onset X-ALD[11–13](#core-r011) as well as in other genetic causes for which genes have not been identified.[14](#core-r014)\\n### X-ALD\\n\\n*Dr. Florian S. Eichler:* Once the diagnosis of X-ALD was suggested by the pattern of the brain MRI and the brain biopsy, targeted testing of specific organelle function (peroxisome, lysosome, and mitochondrion) was the next step. Very-long-chain fatty acids (more than 20 carbons) are degraded in the peroxisome, and therefore, disorders of the peroxisome such as X-ALD lead to the accumulation of these fatty acids in plasma.[15](#core-r015) In this case, testing revealed elevations in the plasma level of very-long-chain fatty acids ([Table 3](#t03)). The *ABCD1* gene on Xq28, which codes for the peroxisomal membrane protein (not an enzyme) ABCD1, a member of the family of proteins known as ATP-binding cassette transporters, is mutated in X-ALD[16,17](#core-r016) ([www.x-ald.nl](https://www.x-ald.nl)). The mechanisms by which the defect in the *ABCD1* gene leads to the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids and the associated phenotypic manifestation are poorly understood. In this patient, analysis of the mutation revealed a substitution of arginine by glutamine at amino acid residue 591, confirming the diagnosis of X-ALD. Further testing of cerebrospinal fluid for the DNA of *Tropheryma whipplei* (which causes Whipple's disease) and testing for *NOTCH3* mutations and a lysosomal-enzyme screen were normal.How unusual is this patient's presentation, and should this diagnosis be considered in all adults with progressive leukoencephalopathy, even those without a family history?[18](#core-r018) Leukodystrophies are characterized by normal early development, followed by loss of skills and regression as the myelin deteriorates. Approximately 35% of patients with X-ALD have the childhood cerebral form, with onset of dementia and adrenal insufficiency between 4 and 8 years of age. Seizures are uncommon but may occur. In another 35 to 40% of patients, the disorder presents in young adulthood as a slowly progressive paraparesis, with sphincter disturbances due to the involvement of long tracts in the spinal cord, referred to as adrenomyeloneuropathy. Rapidly progressive inflammatory demyelination develops in 20% of these patients, and they die in 1 to 2 years.[19,20](#core-r019)Several unusual features in this patient contributed to the delay in diagnosis. His advanced age at the onset of symptoms is uncommon for X-ALD, as is the rapid progression of cerebral disease. More important, he lacked a history of long-tract signs, and most adults with X-ALD have signs and symptoms of a myeloneuropathy by the time they are his age. In adults, cognitive abnormalities can manifest as neuropsychiatric symptoms, and substance abuse, which was a prominent feature of this patient's history, is not uncommon. However, his long history of drug abuse and exposure to environmental toxins further confounded the diagnostic workup, since it provided a more likely explanation for the onset of new symptoms at his age. An important issue for this patient is that the neuropathology of organic-solvent leukoencephalopathy can be indistinguishable from that of cerebral X-ALD on examination of biopsy specimens.[10](#core-r010) In organic-solvent leukoencephalopathy, very-long-chain fatty acids also accumulate in the brain, and the findings of lamellar inclusions in both disorders may reflect this fact. However, the accumulation of these fatty acids in plasma is seen only in cases of X-ALD. Furthermore, the lack of an obvious family history in this case decreased the suspicion for a heritable neurologic disease.Currently, approximately 2000 patients in the United States have been diagnosed with X-ALD as a result of plasma testing of very-long-chain fatty acids.[21](#core-r021) Unfortunately, many adults with leukodystrophies remain undiagnosed, in part because their symptoms are attributed to substance abuse or other disorders such as multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia.\\n\\nDiscussion of Management\\n------------------------\\n\\n*Dr. Eichler:* General supportive care and symptomatic treatment for the patient and his family are crucial. Specialist consultation, nursing, schools, rehabilitation, and social agencies are the cornerstones of the care and treatment of patients with X-ALD. Current medical therapies for patients with X-ALD include hormone-replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency, dietary therapy with Lorenzo's oil (a combination of oleic acid and erucic acid), and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.[22](#core-r022) Other approaches are still under investigation.This patient had no signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, and a corticotropin stimulation test was normal, but continued vigilance is necessary. Physical stress and minor illnesses can be detrimental to patients who have adrenoleukodystrophy with adrenal insufficiency. Dietary therapy and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation are beneficial only for patients who are asymptomatic or in the early stages of the illness.[22,23](#core-r022) Unfortunately, this patient's condition, like that of more than half of patients with cerebral involvement, was too advanced to benefit from currently available therapies.Further questioning of family members revealed that a maternal male cousin had spent many years in a wheelchair; he may have had X-ALD. More important, the patient's daughter was an obligate carrier of the mutation, and her 4-year-old son had an elevated level of very-long-chain fatty acids. He currently has no symptoms and a brain MRI was normal, but he carries a 35% risk of the development of a devastating inflammatory demyelination in the next 6 years. He has been placed on Lorenzo's oil to lower the level of the fatty acids and will receive brain MRIs annually.In hindsight, there are several lessons to be learned from this case. First, genetic and metabolic markers are useful in the workup of neurologic decline not only in children but also in adults. In addition, a history of drug abuse should not sway one from considering genetic causes of neurologic symptoms. This case reminds us that genetic disorders may present in adulthood. In retrospect, this patient's MRI findings are typical of X-ALD, but this possibility was not seriously considered because of the patient's age and other risk factors for leukoencephalopathy. Screening for genetic disorders, including testing for levels of very-long-chain fatty acids, could prevent the performance of unnecessary brain biopsies in a subgroup of adult patients presenting with cognitive decline. Finally, establishing the diagnosis of a neurogenetic disorder allows for family screening and identification of at-risk family members.*Dr. Costello:* The patient's deterioration continued relentlessly and progressed toward a state of akinetic mutism. He died of bronchopneumonia 10 months after his original clinical presentation.\\n\",\n",

      "Question: A 37-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of headaches and memory loss.\n",
      "She was well until seven months earlier, when she began to experience nausea and vomiting. Two days later a brief syncopal episode occurred, and a few days thereafter she became transiently disoriented, anxious, and agitated. She did not recognize her friends. She was taken to a local hospital, where examination showed that the blood pressure was 170 mm Hg systolic; no other abnormality was found. A tranquilizer was prescribed, with apparent improvement. She soon began to complain of diffuse headaches that were present on awakening and often increased during the night. A physician found no neurologic abnormality. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. After another month or two the headaches diminished, but she slept poorly, was depressed, and lost 9 kg in weight.\n",
      "One month before entry the headaches worsened. Neurologic examination was negative. A CT scan disclosed a ring-enhancing lesion with a smooth internal border in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration-biopsy specimen of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. Dexamethasone, phenytoin sodium, cimetidine, and diazepam were prescribed, and she was referred to this hospital.\n",
      "The patient was right-handed. She was a native of Brazil, where she resided in a metropolitan area and often traveled to sheepherding areas. There was a history of a febrile seizure at the age of three years and of rheumatic fever in childhood. She had experienced intermittent migraine headaches for 10 years. She frequently consumed uncooked beef. There was no history of recent seizures or syncope, sensory loss, fever, allergy, cutaneous lesions, use of tobacco or alcohol, or exposure to infectious diseases.\n",
      "The temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\n",
      "On examination the patient was confused and emotional, with child-like behavior. The head and neck were normal. No lymphadenopathy or rash was found. The lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. The liver and spleen were not felt. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\n",
      "Neurologic examination showed that the patient was oriented as to place but poorly oriented as to time. Remote memory appeared normal, but she recalled only one of five objects after three minutes and could not name the president of her country. She was unable to perform simple mathematical problems and failed on the test of serial subtraction of sevens from 100. The nasal margins of the optic disks appeared slightly elevated. The cranial nerves were otherwise normal except that she avoided looking toward objects in the left superior quadrant of the visual field. Motor functions were normal. Tests of cerebellar function were well performed, and gait and station were normal. The tendon reflexes were ++ and equal; the plantar responses were flexor. Examination of sensory functions was negative. She was unable to interpret any numbers traced on her palms and often indicated the wrong lateralization of pinprick of the upper extremities.\n",
      "The urine was normal. The hematocrit was 33.7 per cent; the white-cell count was 8300, with 47 per cent neutrophils, 48 per cent lymphocytes, and 5 per cent monocytes. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm per hour, and the total eosinophil count 53 per cubic millimeter. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg per 100 ml (5.0 mmol per liter), the calcium 8.5 mg per 100 ml (2.1 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 4.6 mg per 100 ml (1.5 mmol per liter), and the protein 6.1 g (the albumin 3.5 g, and the globulin 2.6 g) per 100 ml. An electrocardiogram was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal. Films of the thighs showed no calcification within the quadriceps muscles. Films of the paranasal sinuses disclosed that the turbinates were enlarged and the septum was deviated to the left; the paranasal sinuses were clear, and the pituitary fossa was normal; a left posterior parietal craniectomy defect was present. Films of the skull revealed that the pineal gland was not calcified; no abnormal intracranial calcifications were evident. A CT scan of the brain (\n",
      "Fig. 1\n",
      "), performed after the injection of contrast material, disclosed an area of ring-enhancement in the right anterior temporal region and another area of enhancement in the left posterolateral parietal area, superior and lateral to the lateral ventricle; neither lesion showed a mass effect or perifocal low density. An ultrasound examination of the liver and gallbladder was negative. Scans of the kidneys showed no evidence of hydronephrosis. An x-ray film of the abdomen was normal. An echocardiogram demonstrated prominence of the left coronary sinus and slight mitral-valve prolapse; no valvular vegetations were seen. An electroencephalogram showed nearly continuous, moderate voltage and generalized theta and delta slowing, more prominent on the left side. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid under an initial pressure of 230 mm; the fluid contained 14 red cells, 3 lymphocytes, and 1 larger monocyte per cubic millimeter; microscopical examination disclosed no microorganisms, including fungi and acid-fast bacilli, and an India-ink preparation was negative; xanthochromia was graded 1 on a scale of 10; the protein was 84 mg, and the glucose 61 mg per 100 ml (3.4 mmol per liter), with a simultaneous blood glucose of 92 mg per 100 ml (5.1 mmol per liter); a serologic test for syphilis and a test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen were negative; immunoelectrophoresis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed that IgG was 6.7 mg (normal, 0 to 8.6 mg), and the albumin 51.5 mg per 100 ml (normal, 11 to 48 mg); agarose-gel electrophoresis disclosed no banding on an eightfold concentrated specimen; a cytocentrifugation study revealed 306 cells per milliliter, of which 2 per cent were neutrophils, 53 per cent lymphocytes, and 45 per cent monocytes. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was negative for tumor cells, and a culture yielded no microorganisms. Two blood cultures were negative. Review of the biopsy specimen of the brain obtained elsewhere disclosed that the material was not diagnostic.

      "\n",
      "Dr. Amy A. Pruitt\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient's country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient's lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient's symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient's seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen's disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen's disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient's lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient's initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient's cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient's course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn't mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\n",

      "Dr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\n",

      "Question: A 37-year-old Brazilian woman with a history of intermittent migraine headaches and frequent consumption of uncooked beef presented with a seven-month history of nausea, vomiting, syncopal episode, disorientation, anxiety, agitation, and headaches. Initial CT scan was negative, but a repeat scan one month prior to admission revealed a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration biopsy of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. On admission, neurological examination revealed confusion, disorientation to time, memory deficits, dyscalculia, left superior quadrantanopia, and cortical sensory deficits. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated protein level (84 mg/100 ml) and a monocytic pleocytosis (45% monocytes). A review of the initial biopsy specimen was non-diagnostic.

       "{'original': {'question': 'A 37-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of headaches and memory loss.\\nShe was well until seven months earlier, when she began to experience nausea and vomiting. Two days later a brief syncopal episode occurred, and a few days thereafter she became transiently disoriented, anxious, and agitated. She did not recognize her friends. She was taken to a local hospital, where examination showed that the blood pressure was 170 mm Hg systolic; no other abnormality was found. A tranquilizer was prescribed, with apparent improvement. She soon began to complain of diffuse headaches that were present on awakening and often increased during the night. A physician found no neurologic abnormality. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. After another month or two the headaches diminished, but she slept poorly, was depressed, and lost 9 kg in weight.\\nOne month before entry the headaches worsened. Neurologic examination was negative. A CT scan disclosed a ring-enhancing lesion with a smooth internal border in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration-biopsy specimen of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. Dexamethasone, phenytoin sodium, cimetidine, and diazepam were prescribed, and she was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was right-handed. She was a native of Brazil, where she resided in a metropolitan area and often traveled to sheepherding areas. There was a history of a febrile seizure at the age of three years and of rheumatic fever in childhood. She had experienced intermittent migraine headaches for 10 years. She frequently consumed uncooked beef. There was no history of recent seizures or syncope, sensory loss, fever, allergy, cutaneous lesions, use of tobacco or alcohol, or exposure to infectious diseases.\\nThe temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\\nOn examination the patient was confused and emotional, with child-like behavior. The head and neck were normal. No lymphadenopathy or rash was found. The lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. The liver and spleen were not felt. Pelvic and rectal examinations were negative.\\nNeurologic examination showed that the patient was oriented as to place but poorly oriented as to time. Remote memory appeared normal, but she recalled only one of five objects after three minutes and could not name the president of her country. She was unable to perform simple mathematical problems and failed on the test of serial subtraction of sevens from 100. The nasal margins of the optic disks appeared slightly elevated. The cranial nerves were otherwise normal except that she avoided looking toward objects in the left superior quadrant of the visual field. Motor functions were normal. Tests of cerebellar function were well performed, and gait and station were normal. The tendon reflexes were ++ and equal; the plantar responses were flexor. Examination of sensory functions was negative. She was unable to interpret any numbers traced on her palms and often indicated the wrong lateralization of pinprick of the upper extremities.\\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 33.7 per cent; the white-cell count was 8300, with 47 per cent neutrophils, 48 per cent lymphocytes, and 5 per cent monocytes. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm per hour, and the total eosinophil count 53 per cubic millimeter. The urea nitrogen was 14 mg per 100 ml (5.0 mmol per liter), the calcium 8.5 mg per 100 ml (2.1 mmol per liter), the phosphorus 4.6 mg per 100 ml (1.5 mmol per liter), and the protein 6.1 g (the albumin 3.5 g, and the globulin 2.6 g) per 100 ml. An electrocardiogram was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal. Films of the thighs showed no calcification within the quadriceps muscles. Films of the paranasal sinuses disclosed that the turbinates were enlarged and the septum was deviated to the left; the paranasal sinuses were clear, and the pituitary fossa was normal; a left posterior parietal craniectomy defect was present. Films of the skull revealed that the pineal gland was not calcified; no abnormal intracranial calcifications were evident. A CT scan of the brain (\\nFig. 1\\n), performed after the injection of contrast material, disclosed an area of ring-enhancement in the right anterior temporal region and another area of enhancement in the left posterolateral parietal area, superior and lateral to the lateral ventricle; neither lesion showed a mass effect or perifocal low density. An ultrasound examination of the liver and gallbladder was negative. Scans of the kidneys showed no evidence of hydronephrosis. An x-ray film of the abdomen was normal. An echocardiogram demonstrated prominence of the left coronary sinus and slight mitral-valve prolapse; no valvular vegetations were seen. An electroencephalogram showed nearly continuous, moderate voltage and generalized theta and delta slowing, more prominent on the left side. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid under an initial pressure of 230 mm; the fluid contained 14 red cells, 3 lymphocytes, and 1 larger monocyte per cubic millimeter; microscopical examination disclosed no microorganisms, including fungi and acid-fast bacilli, and an India-ink preparation was negative; xanthochromia was graded 1 on a scale of 10; the protein was 84 mg, and the glucose 61 mg per 100 ml (3.4 mmol per liter), with a simultaneous blood glucose of 92 mg per 100 ml (5.1 mmol per liter); a serologic test for syphilis and a test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen were negative; immunoelectrophoresis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed that IgG was 6.7 mg (normal, 0 to 8.6 mg), and the albumin 51.5 mg per 100 ml (normal, 11 to 48 mg); agarose-gel electrophoresis disclosed no banding on an eightfold concentrated specimen; a cytocentrifugation study revealed 306 cells per milliliter, of which 2 per cent were neutrophils, 53 per cent lymphocytes, and 45 per cent monocytes. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was negative for tumor cells, and a culture yielded no microorganisms. Two blood cultures were negative. Review of the biopsy specimen of the brain obtained elsewhere disclosed that the material was not diagnostic.

       "  'reasoning': '\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Amy A. Pruitt\\\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient\\'s country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient\\'s lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient\\'s symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient\\'s seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient\\'s lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months\\' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient\\'s initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months\\' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient\\'s course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn\\'t mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\\n',\n",

Two days later a brief syncopal episode occurred, and a few days thereafter she became transiently disoriented, anxious, and agitated. She did not recognize her friends. She was taken to a local hospital, where examination showed that the blood pressure was 170 mm Hg systolic; no other abnormality was found. A tranquilizer was prescribed, with apparent improvement. She soon began to complain of diffuse headaches that were present on awakening and often increased during the night. A physician found no neurologic abnormality. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. After another month or two the headaches diminished, but she slept poorly, was depressed, and lost 9 kg in weight.\\nOne month before entry the headaches worsened. Neurologic examination was negative. A CT scan disclosed a ring-enhancing lesion with a smooth internal border in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration-biopsy specimen of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. Dexamethasone, phenytoin sodium, cimetidine, and diazepam were prescribed, and she was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was right-handed. She was a native of Brazil, where she resided in a metropolitan area and often traveled to sheepherding areas. There was a history of a febrile seizure at the age of three years and of rheumatic fever in childhood. She had experienced intermittent migraine headaches for 10 years. She frequently consumed uncooked beef. There was no history of recent seizures or syncope, sensory loss, fever, allergy, cutaneous lesions, use of tobacco or alcohol, or exposure to infectious diseases.\\nThe temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 90, and the respirations 18. The blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.\\nOn examination the patient was confused and emotional, with child-like behavior. The head and neck were normal. No lymphadenopathy or rash was found. The lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. The liver and spleen were not felt.

Remote memory appeared normal, but she recalled only one of five objects after three minutes and could not name the president of her country. She was unable to perform simple mathematical problems and failed on the test of serial subtraction of sevens from 100. The nasal margins of the optic disks appeared slightly elevated. The cranial nerves were otherwise normal except that she avoided looking toward objects in the left superior quadrant of the visual field. Motor functions were normal. Tests of cerebellar function were well performed, and gait and station were normal. The tendon reflexes were ++ and equal; the plantar responses were flexor. Examination of sensory functions was negative.

Films of the paranasal sinuses disclosed that the turbinates were enlarged and the septum was deviated to the left; the paranasal sinuses were clear, and the pituitary fossa was normal; a left posterior parietal craniectomy defect was present. Films of the skull revealed that the pineal gland was not calcified; no abnormal intracranial calcifications were evident. A CT scan of the brain (\\nFig. 1\\n), performed after the injection of contrast material, disclosed an area of ring-enhancement in the right anterior temporal region and another area of enhancement in the left posterolateral parietal area, superior and lateral to the lateral ventricle; neither lesion showed a mass effect or perifocal low density.

       "   'reasoning': '\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Amy A. Pruitt\\\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient\\'s country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient\\'s lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient\\'s symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma). Metastases from the lung to the central nervous system are more likely than those from the three other sites to antedate clinical or laboratory evidence of the primary tumor. This patient\\'s seven-month course with an apparent remission of the symptoms for several months was long and atypical for metastasis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated protein content but no increase in cellularity, although the differential count by cytocentrifuge disclosed a relatively high proportion of monocytoid cells. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is clearly more useful in the detection of a malignant tumor in the presence of leptomeningeal invasion, but some studies have suggested a high yield of cells from parenchymal metastases, somewhat better than from primary tumors in one study and about the same in another.[5,6](#core-r005) The yield from tumors close to the ventricular surface was the best. Also of value was the information derived from some more recently studied spinal-fluid markers, such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), that were not measured in this case. CEA is said to be markedly increased in nearly half the patients with metastases but not in those with a primary tumor. The diagnostic yield was not increased by fortuitous timing of the studies soon after biopsy of the tumor.How can we use the specific CT-scan features in this case to support the diagnosis of metastatic tumor? The lack of a scan without enhancement is unfortunate since most meningiomas and 50 per cent of metastatic tumors are of increased attenuation relative to the surrounding brain, and most glial tumors are of mixed, largely lower attenuation. Does the predominantly intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion favor any histologic type of metastatic tumor? Intraventricular metastases are uncommon but have been reported in association with a variety of tumors, including atrial myxoma. Choriocarcinoma has also been reported in an intraventricular location. Intraventricular metastases are seen more often when there is diffuse meningeal spread of a neoplasm, which is common in cases of lymphomas and leukemias and is also seen in cases of melanoma, oat-cell carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the breast. In this case the characteristic spinal-fluid formula of hypoglycorrhachia, increased protein content, and pleocytosis was absent, and it is uncommon for meningeal carcinomatosis to occur in the absence of widespread systemic metastases.None of these considerations exclude a metastatic neoplasm, but in the absence of evidence of systemic spread I shall consider the primary brain tumors that might produce two cystic enhancing lesions, one of which was largely intraventricular. I shall concentrate for clues on the left-sided lesion.Few tumors are always intraventricular, but many are found infrequently in such a location. Intraventricular meningiomas account for less than 2 per cent of all meningiomas in the adult but account for 17 per cent of them in children.[7](#core-r007) The adult tumor may arise from a lateral ventricle, the left much more commonly than the right. It may give rise to symptoms consistent with intermittent obstruction to the cerebrospinal-fluid circulation. It is of interest that in one series a number of patients presented with symptoms resembling those of migraine, with focal deficits, usually hemianopia, at the peak of the headache.[7](#core-r007) This patient had a history of migraine, episodic symptoms, and a remitting course. However, several features of the CT scans make the diagnosis of meningioma very questionable. First of all, the lesions were multiple, whereas multiple meningiomas are usually associated with von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, of which there was no evidence in this patient. A few cases of multiple meningiomas without von Recklinghausen\\'s disease, some of them in patients with a family history of meningioma, have been reported, but such cases are rare.[8](#core-r008) Secondly, this patient\\'s lesions were cystic. Only about 4 per cent of meningiomas are cystic, and they are usually accompanied by features indicating a more aggressive or malignant form of the tumor. There may be edema, absence of calcification, and nonhomogeneous enhancement. These tumors, when intraventricular, are sometimes misdiagnosed as gliomas. I am unaware of any studies that shed light on the frequency of multicentricity in cases of malignant cystic intraventricular meningiomas. To make this diagnosis, therefore, I would have to accept three uncommon features — the intraventricular location, the cystic nature of the lesions, and the multicentricity of the lesions.A far better diagnosis on statistical grounds is in the neuroglial cell line. No glial neoplasm, with the possible exception of optic-nerve glioma, is exempt from the complication of subarachnoid spread and implantation at distant sites both intraparenchymally and in the subarachnoid space. An oligodendroglioma can arise in or near the ventricular surface, but the absence of calcification and the great rarity of multicentricity argue against it. An astrocytoma is a reasonable explanation for the clinical picture and the CT scans in this case. Nonspecific prodromal complaints of several months\\' duration and a remission in symptoms are frequent features of astrocytomas. The left-sided lesion may have been difficult to detect in an intraventricular location, and either or both lesions could have been isodense with the brain parenchyma at the time of the initial CT scan. Astrocytomas can be multiple, and many are cystic. Among our patients with glioblastomas with the diagnosis confirmed pathologically 4 per cent of those who were untreated and 6 per cent of those who were treated had multicentric tumors.[9](#core-r009) A subependymal and ventricular location is most common for the giant-cell astrocytoma, which is usually associated with radiologically demonstrable calcification and with clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis, but astrocytomas of all varieties may invade and fill a ventricle. Invasion of the meninges is more common than diffuse or multifocal seeding. Investigators at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center described multifocal seeding of the meninges by astrocytomas in 12 of their 52 patients; most of the 12 patients were younger and had a longer survival than those who did not have that complication.[10](#core-r010) Perhaps this patient\\'s initial biopsy specimen was taken from a region near the infiltrating area of tumor adjacent to the ventricle. However, other tumors, such as malignant meningioma, can induce reactive hyperplasia of astrocytes mimicking tumor formation, and spread of an amelanotic melanoma may mimic that of a poorly differentiated astrocytoma.Does any other tumor in the glioma category fit as well or better with our information about this case? The most common variety of intraventricular neuroglial tumor is the ependymoma, which arises from cells lining the ventricular surfaces and accounts for about 5 per cent of all intracranial tumors. Forty per cent of them are located above the tentorium.[11](#core-r011) They are frequently large, cystic, and coarsely lobulated and may grow into the ventricles or into cerebral tissue, sometimes with no obvious connection to the ependyma. Of the primary brain tumors, they are the least likely to calcify. Cytologic examination of intraventricular material might be expected to be helpful diagnostically but can be confusing because the neoplastic cells may resemble their normal counterparts. Also, the frequent misinterpretation as \"monocytoid cells\" is interesting in view of the predominance of monocytes in this patient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid. Infratentorial tumors occur principally in the first two decades, whereas patients with tumors in the lateral ventricles have an average age of 28 years at the onset of symptoms. At least two studies have shown no clear correlation between the histologic grade of the tumor and its behavior.[11,12](#core-r011) Seeding of the subarachnoid space or spread to other areas of the brain is distinctly less common in association with ependymomas than with either astrocytomas or medulloblastomas. However, the ependymomas that arise in the lateral ventricles tend to have a more malignant histologic pattern and to occur in patients above the mean age for this tumor.[11](#core-r011) Like astrocytomas, ependymomas appear to be capable of dedifferentiating after behaving initially as a tumor of a low grade of malignancy, with a subsequent much more rapid course of several months\\' duration.Finally, many glial tumors consist of two or more cell types, which may be intermingled or present in discrete areas. The most common combinations are oligodendrogliocytes with astrocytes and ependymal cells with other cells of glial type.[13](#core-r013) Theoretically, two or more cell lines may become neoplastic simultaneously, as occurs in some chemically induced tumors, or one cell line may induce neoplastic transformation of adjacent glial or mesenchymal cells.I believe that the negative physical examination and laboratory evaluation combined with the CT appearance of the tumor and the location in this case favor a primary Central-nervous-system tumor of a neuroglial cell line or lines, even allowing for the relatively uncommon phenomenon of multicentricity. A diagnosis that is clinically, statistically, and radiographically consistent with this patient\\'s course is a primary neuroglial tumor of glial, ependymal, or mixed cell type. From its apparent rapid evolution as shown by the CT scans the tumor must be considered clinically, if not histologically, malignant. I suspect that the physicians involved in this case were unable to make a specific diagnosis based on all the data but that the diagnosis was established by a biopsy of the more readily accessible lesion in the right temporal lobe.Dr. Robert A. Levine: Dr. Pruitt, you didn\\'t mention a primary Central-nervous-system lymphoma.Dr. Pruitt: Lymphomas have been multicentric in a number of reported cases. The enhancing properties on CT scanning differ, however, from what was seen in this case. Lymphomas are rarely cystic, and none are intraventricular. Many are associated with a striking cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis. This patient had received steroids at the time of the second CT scan on admission to this hospital, but there was still marked enhancement, admittedly with a double dose of contrast material. I considered that finding additional evidence against a primary malignant lymphoma.Dr. Edward P. Richardson, Jr.: The patient was under the care of Dr. Adams. Will you comment?Dr. Raymond D. Adams: We carefully examined the tissue removed from the left temporal lobe, and I was convinced, as Dr. Richardson was, that there were no tumor cells in that specimen. Dr. Pruitt has outlined the various steps that we went through in trying to eliminate a nontumorous disease. We finally concluded that the differential diagnosis was between a malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma. We searched fairly hard for a source for metastasis. The problem was made difficult because the patient was psychotic and was unmanageable on the ward. The psychosis was in large measure related to both the tumor implants and the corticosteroids, which we had to continue because of high intracranial pressure. We were unsure of the diagnosis until the time of the operation.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. Richardson: The operation, which was performed by Dr. William H. Sweet, was a craniotomy with a biopsy of the right anterior temporal lobe. In its central portion he encountered a cystic tumor, from which he withdrew about 5 ml of sanguineous fluid that contained many malignant neoplastic cells. Microscopical examination of tissue specimens from the tumor revealed an anaplastic pleomorphic neoplasm ([Fig. 2](#f002)). A large proportion of the tumor cells were small, with deeply stained nuclei and clearly outlined homogeneous cytoplasm. These cells tended to become packed together in a manner suggesting an epithelial neoplasm. Interspersed among them were larger cells with irregular, less well-defined cytoplasm and a few giant cells. Mitotic figures ranged up to 14 per high-power field, and many of them were multipolar. In some areas the tumor cells were radially arranged around minute blood vessels, with thick or tapering processes that reached the vascular adventitia ([Fig. 3](#f003)). The boundary between the neoplasm and the surrounding brain tissue was generally distinct, but infiltration of the parenchyma by individual tumor cells could be demonstrated in many areas. In the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor there was a marked increase in the size and number of astrocytes. Scattered throughout the brain tissue numerous small, darkly staining irregular nuclei not identifiable as those of normal or reactive cells were seen; their presence indicated that the neoplasm had a diffusely infiltrative character as well as a tendency to form discrete cellular accumulations.Sections were also stained with the peroxidaseantieroxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of glial fibrillary acid protein, which is a distinctive cyto-chemical feature of astrocytes. Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\\n',\n",

       "   'question': \"A 37-year-old Brazilian woman with a history of intermittent migraine headaches and frequent consumption of uncooked beef presented with a seven-month history of nausea, vomiting, syncopal episode, disorientation, anxiety, agitation, and headaches. Initial CT scan was negative, but a repeat scan one month prior to admission revealed a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe and a multilobular, enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. A needle-aspiration biopsy of the left parietal lesion was interpreted as a Grade I astrocytoma. On admission, neurological examination revealed confusion, disorientation to time, memory deficits, dyscalculia, left superior quadrantanopia, and cortical sensory deficits. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated protein level (84 mg/100 ml) and a monocytic pleocytosis (45% monocytes). A review of the initial biopsy specimen was non-diagnostic. Given the clinical presentation, imaging findings, CSF analysis, and the patient's background, what is the most likely final diagnosis?\",\n",
       "   'reasoning': '\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Amy A. Pruitt\\\\*: This 37-year-old Brazilian woman was evaluated at this hospital after a seven-month illness characterized by symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Initially, she had no localizing symptoms, and there were no indications of a systemic disease, although she sustained a 9-kg weight loss, perhaps attributable to mood alteration. The early course was punctuated by a syncopal spell and by an episode of disorientation, raising the question of either seizure activity or a sudden fluctuation in intracranial pressure. Two months after the onset of the illness there was a four-month remission at a time when neither the neurologic examination nor the CT scan apparently revealed any abnormalities. We do not know what type of CT scan was performed or if contrast enhancement was used, but it appears that amajor change evolved because six months after the initial symptoms the headaches became more severe and a CT scan disclosed two ring-enhancing lesions. After a nondiagnostic biopsy at another hospital the entire course of the subsequent evaluation at this hospital was dictated by the CT scan. Dr. Hesselink, may we review the radiologic findings?Dr. John R. Hesselink: The CT scan obtained at this hospital ([Fig. 1](#f001)) shows a contrast-enhanced mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. Some low-density areas are visible within it, but there is no apparent low density surrounding it. An important question is whether the mass was within the ventricle or immediately adjacent to it. Two findings favor an intraventricular location. The orientation of the long axis of the mass follows the course of the ventricle, and the left temporal horn is dilated, indicating entrapment, which is more common with an intraventricular lesion. A coronal scan might have helped to define the relation of the mass to the ventricle. An arteriographic study would also have been helpful because the vascular supply of intraventricular lesions is predominantly from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. The second lesion in the right temporal region is characterized by nodular and curvilinear enhancement with a low-density center. On a delayed scan done one hour later the low-density areas in the left-hemisphere lesion are filled with contrast material, and the low-density area in the right temporal region is isodense relative to the adjacent brain. In summary, there were two contrast-enhanced lesions, one in or adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and the second in the right temporal region.Dr. Pruitt: Do you see any evidence of calcification?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: Is there diffuse enhancement of the cisterns?Dr. Hesselink: No.Dr. Pruitt: The examination on admission to this hospital revealed deficits consistent with the findings on the CT scan. The patient had an apparent left superior quadrantanopia, a severe recent memory deficit, dyscalculia, a cortical sensory deficit, and left-right confusion. Less specifically, she had papilledema and an altered sensorium, with emotional lability and disorientation to time. The general examination disclosed no cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, or visceral abnormality. In short, the clinician must have returned unenlightened regarding the diagnostic possibilities suggested by the CT scans.The CT-scan characteristics of the lesions that are useful in the differential diagnosis, in a roughly ascending order of specificity, include their multiplicity, the ring enhancement, the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas, the absence of calcification, the evaluation of the abnormalities over a six-month interval, and the location. I shall discuss the likelihood of each diagnostic possibility on the basis of these findings, the clinical course, and the few laboratory abnormalities noted.The patient\\'s country of residence and her travel and gastronomic predilections force consideration of infectious agents that can produce Central-nervous-system lesions. Hydatidosis, a disease with a worldwide distribution that parallels the distribution of sheep breeding, is caused by the cystic modification of a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus.* Cysts are common in the liver and the lungs, but cerebral cysts occur in less than 2 per cent of the cases.[1](#core-r001) The lesions are usually single and subcortical and are demonstrable with an enormous, low-density, nonenhancing cystic center with little or no rim enhancement. This woman had no evidence of systemic hydatid infestation, since x-ray films of the chest and ultrasonograms and films of the abdomen were normal. Serologic testing is not mentioned, but depending on the technique it may be unreliable, and there has been recent discussion of false-positive tests in association with malignant tumors. The CT-scan pattern is atypical for echinococcal cysts, particularly in view of the delayed enhancement of the cystic areas and the intraventricular location of the left-sided lesion. The sheep were proximal, but they were not the proximate cause.Although the patient admitted only to eating raw beef, whose parasite, *Taenia saginata*, does not affect the central nervous system, her residence in an area of endemic *T. solium* infection requires one further foray into infectious possibilities. Central-nervous-system cysticercosis, caused by infection with the larva of the pork tapeworm, results in several neurologic lesions, including meningeal inflammation, multiple cerebral masses with focal effects, diffuse parenchymal involvement with intracranial hypertension, spinal-cord masses, and ventricular cysts.[2](#core-r002) Intracranial disease occurs in 60 to 90 per cent of the cases.[3](#core-r003) The cysts also lodge in other viscera and in skeletal muscle. This patient had no subcutaneous nodules, no peripheral eosinophilia, and no increase in cells in the spinal fluid. The films of the iliopsoas muscles were normal, and there was no evidence of calcification, the most typical finding on x-ray films of the skull, which is detected even more commonly on the CT scans. Parenchymal lesions present either as foci of low density with rim enhancement or, less often, as multiple dense lesions on unenhanced scans, simulating metastases. In contrast to echinococcosis, cysticercosis frequently occurs within the ventricular system. The symptoms may be episodic as a consequence of changes in the position of the cysts, with intermittent obstruction at the foramen of Monro. This patient\\'s lesions would be highly unusual for cysticercosis. They were not calcified, they were larger than the average 10-to-20-mm lesions that are usually seen with that disorder, and there was marked enhancement with contrast material on delayed scanning. Thus, although cysticercosis fits the course and CT picture somewhat better than echinococcal disease I shall discard it and indeed the whole category of infectious diseases in view of the absence of peripheral signs and the CT-scan inconsistencies.What type of neoplasm best accounts for this patient\\'s symptoms and the radiologic findings? The presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastatic tumor. Although approximately 52 per cent of metastatic neoplasms are multicentric, as demonstrated by CT scans at the time of presentation, far fewer primary brain tumors arise in anatomically distinct locations. With the exception of weight loss, we have no evidence of an extraneural malignant tumor in this case. Examination of the skin, breast, rectum, and pelvis was negative. The patient was mildly anemic, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was low, the tests of hepatic and renal function were negative, and the calcium level was normal. X-ray films of the chest were normal, and the patient was not a smoker. Xero-mammograms and whole-lung tomograms might have carried the investigation a step further, but several studies have suggested that initial investigations for a primary site in the presence of Central-nervous-system metastases have a fairly low yield. The most disappointing study produced the answer in only 9 per cent of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma.[4](#core-r004) In a woman the most likely primary sites are the lung, breast, bowel, and skin (melanoma).

Many of the neoplastic cells gave a positive stain, indicating their astrocytic nature ([Fig. 4](#f004)). The validity of the technique in these sections was confirmed by the strongly positive staining of the reactive astrocytes in the adjacent cerebral tissue ([Fig. 5](#f005)) and further by the absence of staining in identically treated sections of a nonglial nervous-system tumor, a schwannoma.The tumor is best classified as a malignant astrocytoma, although its appearance in many areas suggested the possibility of an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. The presence of perivascular groupings of tumor cells, or perivascular pseudorosettes, raises the question of differentiation in the direction of ependymal cells, but it is more likely in view of the overall character of the neoplasm that they exemplify the kind of gliomatous growth that has been called astroblastomatous.[14](#core-r014) The usual designation for the most malignant variety of glioma — glioblastoma multiforme—is very appropriate in this case. According to the grading system originally proposed by Kernohan and Sayre,[15](#core-r015) this tumor was an astrocytoma, Grade IV.Although we have a histopathologic diagnosis from only one of the tumor masses, it is most likely that the other one, in the left parietal region, was of the same variety. Thus, the neoplasm is best regarded as multicentric.\\n',\n",

      "Question: A 16-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of fever, rash, and severe ocular disease.\n",
      "The patient had been in good health until three months earlier, when small, painful, mildly pruritic vesicles appeared on her left thigh. She was given oral and topical medications, and the rash disappeared within a few days, leaving hyperpigmented scars. Thereafter, she had intermittent fever, fatigue, and anorexia, with a weight loss of 14 kg.\n",
      "Two weeks before admission, the patient's left ear began to drain. Several days before admission, painful intraoral lesions appeared. One day before admission, clarithromycin was prescribed for recurrent drainage from the left ear, and vision in the right eye decreased markedly. An examination elsewhere showed scleritis and uveitis. Topical erythromycin was administered, and the patient was referred to this hospital.\n",
      "The patient had been born in the United States to Cambodian parents. At the age of 14 years, the patient had given birth to a healthy daughter after an uncomplicated pregnancy. The hematocrit during her pregnancy was 36 percent. There was a history of mild varicella and sex with multiple partners. She had had an abnormal vaginal smear, but repeated smears during the year before admission were negative. She had received medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension intramuscularly for a year, followed by amenorrhea. She had recently noted hair loss. There was no history of tuberculosis or exposure to it or of travel to Cambodia.\n",
      "The temperature was 39.2°C, the pulse was 130, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\n",
      "The patient appeared acutely and chronically ill. Examination revealed marked swelling around the right orbit, with severe chemosis, diffuse conjunctival infection, and tenderness of the sclera on palpation. Visual acuity was limited, with an ability to discern the number of fingers held up at a maximal distance of 0.6 m, and extraocular movement was restricted laterally by the chemosis. There was a large right retinal detachment, probably exudative, involving the macula. There was minimal erythema of the left eye, with slight scleral thickening; the fundus appeared normal. Visual acuity was 20/40. Greenish pus issued from a perforation in the left tympanic membrane. The right ear was normal. A few scattered ulcers covered by white exudate were observed on the buccal mucosa and soft palate, and several petechiae were scattered on the soft palate. There was a small amount of exudate on the left tonsil. Examination of the skin showed a few periungual telangiectases, prominent palmar erythema, and hyperpigmented macular lesions on the left anterior thigh in a distribution resembling the L2 dermatome. Slightly atrophic erythematous plaques with silvery scales were present on each upper eyelid and in the right malar region. Shotty posterior cervical and right axillary lymph nodes and left inguinal lymph nodes, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, were palpable. A nonradiating, grade 2 systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border.\n",
      "The urine was positive (++) for protein. The sediment contained 5 to 10 red cells, 10 to 20 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power field; there were 10 to 20 hyaline casts per low-power field. Other laboratory tests were performed (\n",

      "Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and gentamicin, ceftazidime, acyclovir, and methylprednisolone (40 mg daily) were given intravenously. A urine culture yielded rare gram-negative enteric rods, and a culture of drainage fluid from the left ear yielded\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr. Jane G. Schaller[\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic images?Dr. Robert T. Bramson: The CT scan ([Figure 1](#f01)) of the right eye shows marked thickening of the soft tissue within and around the globe. The frontal, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses appear normal, but the left mastoid air cells are sclerotic and filled with fluid. There is slight, generalized cerebral atrophy. There is no evidence of a space-occupying lesion.Dr. Schaller: Being a rheumatologist, I shall begin with a discussion of rheumatic diseases, although there are no test results that are clearly diagnostic of rheumatic disease in this case. It is crucial in cases of this type to consider specifically treatable diseases that can mimic rheumatic diseases, including infectious diseases, malignant tumors, and other conditions with traumatic or environmental causes. In the present case, the question of infectious disease, particularly varicella–zoster virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, looms large, and a malignant tumor is also possible.Could any one rheumatic disease explain all the findings in this case? Systemic lupus erythematosus could,[1](#core-r001) but we have no information about serum complement levels or important serologic tests, including those for antinuclear antibodies and for antibodies to double-stranded DNA and Sm, Ro, and La antigens. Although antinuclear-antibody–negative lupus has been reported,[2](#core-r002) two negative tests at a good laboratory effectively rule out systemic lupus erythematosus.The diagnostic criteria for lupus are shown in [Table 3](#t03). The malar rash in this patient, although puzzling as described, is consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. A skin biopsy can be helpful diagnostically, since a rash associated with lupus has a characteristic histopathological appearance, although one hesitates to perform a biopsy in highly visible regions, such as the face. The dermatomal vesicular rash that heralded this patient's illness and suggested the presence of varicella–zoster virus is also consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. Lupus-associated rashes may take many forms and may affect any part of the body. A similar vesicular rash with a dermatomal distribution has been described in a teenager with lupus.[3](#core-r003) The patient under discussion had painful intraoral lesions and a renal disorder, with urinary findings that were consistent with the presence of early lupus nephritis. The finding of cerebral atrophy on the CT scan in this case is consistent with the presence of lupus cerebritis.[4](#core-r004) The patient had a hematologic disorder with severe anemia and a positive Coombs' test; her reticulocytosis was only mild, possibly because of the severity of her illness. The description of the blood smear does not help clarify the cause of the anemia, but it does make thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or the hemolytic–uremic syndrome unlikely. The apparent absence of anemia during the patient's pregnancy makes thalassemia or another type of hereditary anemia unlikely. Her low serum iron levels and total iron-binding capacity are consistent with the presence of iron deficiency and chronic disease. The patient had lymphopenia on a differential count; as a criterion for the diagnosis of lupus, lymphopenia is defined as fewer than 1500 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter; her absolute lymphocyte count was 528 per cubic millimeter. She had a biologic false positive serologic test for syphilis, with a negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum.* It would be interesting to know the results of these tests at the time of her pregnancy two years earlier.Even in the absence of information about a test for antinuclear antibodies, this patient's disease appears to meet the diagnostic criteria for lupus. If a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative, however, I would consider lupus an unlikely diagnosis.Are the other clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis of lupus? The most striking component of the eye disease was scleritis. Among patients with rheumatic diseases, scleritis is seen most often in those with rheumatoid factor–positive rheumatoid arthritis[5](#core-r005) or Wegener's granulomatosis[5–9](#core-r005); it is occasionally seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus[10,11](#core-r010) or other conditions, including sarcoidosis, Behçet's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's syndrome, dermatomyositis, polyarteritis nodosa and other forms of vasculitis, and polychondritis.[5,6,9,12–15](#core-r005) This patient also had iridocyclitis and choroiditis, as well as a large right retinal detachment, which was probably related to the posterior scleritis. Many infections can cause scleritis,[16–21](#core-r016) including HIV infection, varicella–zoster virus, Lyme disease, syphilis, and tuberculosis.Other findings consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in this patient include the chronic course of the illness, fever, weight loss, malaise, alopecia, periungual telangiectasia, palmar erythema, shotty lymphadenopathy, and petechiae on the soft palate. Laboratory findings that are consistent with the diagnosis, in addition to those already mentioned, include the very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels, the elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, the very high level of ferritin (which may have been acting as an acute-phase reactant), and the elevated globulin fraction, with a reversal of the ratio of albumin to globulin. The slight hypocalcemia may be related to the low serum albumin level.Ear drainage is a nonspecific finding for systemic lupus erythematosus. The radiographs suggest the presence of a chronic process in the ear and mastoid that is unrelated to the current illness. In summary, nearly all the clinical and laboratory findings are consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.The findings in this case are also consistent with the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, although the disorder is rare in young people.[22,23](#core-r022) Features that suggest this diagnosis include the drainage from the ear, the oral ulcers, the abnormal results of urinalysis, the scleritis, and the debilitating nature of the chronic febrile illness. The criteria for the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis are shown in [Table 4](#t04).[24](#core-r024) This patient had oral ulcers. She had no nasal involvement, but she did have involvement of the ear, mastoid, and sinuses, which occurs in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. The findings on the chest radiograph were normal, but microhematuria was present. Although ocular involvement is not a diagnostic criterion, severe scleritis occurs in up to 16 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis.[5–9](#core-r005) Of most immediate interest diagnostically would be the results of a test for antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). The cytoplasmic type of ANCA (c-ANCA) is present in about 80 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and is characteristic of the disorder.[25,26](#core-r025) A few features of this case that are not suggestive of the diagnosis, however, are the facial rash, the positive Coombs' test, and the biologic false positive test for syphilis.Behçet's disease can cause oral ulcers and ocular disease ([Table 5](#t05)),[27](#core-r027) but the latter is most often manifested as uveitis, retinitis, or both[13](#core-r013); scleritis is rare. This patient did not have recurrent genital ulcers, a common feature of Behçet's disease. The rash resembling varicella–zoster was probably not the papulopustular lesion characteristic of Behçet's disease. Finally, Behçet's disease is not associated with hemolytic anemia or a biologic false positive test for syphilis, two findings reported in this case.Sarcoidosis[14,28](#core-r014) can cause uveitis, anergy on delayed-hypersensitivity testing, elevated liver-function values, renal involvement, and occasionally scleritis, although it is not the usual form of eye disease. However, the degree of anemia reported in this case is atypical of sarcoidosis. The angiotensin-converting–enzyme level was normal in this case, but it is elevated in only about 60 percent of cases of sarcoidosis. Chest involvement, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, arthritis, and erythema nodosum, which are common findings in cases of sarcoidosis, were absent in this case.Two types of spondyloarthropathy should also be mentioned.[15,29](#core-r015) Reiter's syndrome could account for the prolonged febrile illness, the oral ulcers, and even the urinary findings, but the eye disease associated with Reiter's syndrome is generally conjunctivitis, keratitis, or acute iritis, not scleritis. Furthermore, this patient had no musculoskeletal involvement, a hallmark of Reiter's syndrome. Inflammatory bowel disease, notably Crohn's disease, can present in young people without gastrointestinal symptoms. It can be associated with mouth sores and a prolonged febrile illness and can cause scleritis,[15](#core-r015) but the serologic findings in this case are not consistent with the presence of Crohn's disease.Polyarteritis is a diagnostic consideration, but it is usually not associated with a positive Coombs' test or a biologic false positive test for syphilis. Other rheumatic conditions that have been associated with scleritis include seropositive rheumatoid arthritis,[30](#core-r030) for which there is no clinical evidence in this case, and dermatomyositis,[31](#core-r031) which could explain the patient's facial and periungual rashes. Although she had no history of myalgia or muscle weakness, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels could be due to muscle disease rather than liver disease.It is very important to consider specifically treatable diseases, such as infectious diseases, before diagnosing a rheumatic disease, since treatments for rheumatic diseases are nonspecific and may mask the symptoms and signs of infectious diseases. Could an infectious disease explain all the findings in this case, or at least some of them, such as the ear drainage and the ocular disease? The negative blood cultures make bacterial sepsis unlikely.The patient probably also had herpes zoster, although only about 5 percent of cases occur before the age of 16 years.[32](#core-r032) In children with herpes zoster, a predisposing disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, an immunodeficiency disorder, or a malignant tumor should be considered. Varicella–zoster virus can cause ocular disease,[19](#core-r019) which is occasionally manifested as scleritis; it can involve the liver, with slightly elevated liver-function values, and can cause a prolonged febrile illness, particularly in a predisposed host. This girl had a history of chickenpox. There is evidence that chickenpox in infancy may be associated with zoster during later childhood,[33](#core-r033) but herpes zoster alone would not explain the positive Coombs' test, the severe anemia, or the false positive serologic test for syphilis. The administration of acyclovir on admission indicates that the patient's physicians also thought of varicella–zoster as either a cause of her illness or a factor contributing to it.Dr. Quan D. Nguyen: The initial lesions on the patient's face and around her right eye were herpetic. We were very concerned about the possibility of systemic herpetic infection and decided to administer intravenous acyclovir as part of the initial treatment.Dr. Schaller: HIV infection could cause all the features of this patient's disease, including the serologic abnormalities.[18,34–37](#core-r018) Indeed, at times HIV infection is difficult to distinguish from systemic lupus erythematosus, because patients with HIV infection may have autoantibodies, patients with lupus may have antibodies to HIV, and in rare cases systemic lupus erythematosus and HIV infection coexist. Rashes and nephritis can occur in patients with HIV infection. Retinitis with cotton-wool exudates is the usual form of ocular involvement, but secondary infection with cytomegalovirus, *T. pallidum,* mycobacteria, various fungi, or pseudomonas can affect any part of the eye.Could any other infectious diseases have had a role in this case?[16–21](#core-r016) The chronic otitis with drainage could have had an infectious origin. The patient had not been exposed to tuberculosis, and her chest film showed normal findings. The negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum* rules out syphilis as a cause. Infection with Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, or various fungi could conceivably have accounted for some or all of the findings.Finally, the possibility of a malignant tumor must be considered. Lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, malignant histiocytosis, leukemia, lymphomatoid granulomatosis,[9](#core-r009) angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions indicative of T-cell dysfunction, and neuroblastoma come to mind. All these disorders can cause fever and multisystem disease and can affect the eye, although the combination of scleritis and uveitis would be unusual. Chronic ear drainage such as this patient had often occurs in histiocytosis.[38](#core-r038)If I were this patient's physician, I would begin by ordering the appropriate serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus; the results of a test for antinuclear antibodies should be available within a day. If the test were positive, at a high titer, and no other serologic abnormalities were found, there would be no need to perform biopsies to establish a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. I would also request an ANCA test. To rule out a malignant tumor, I would examine a blood smear and consider a bone marrow biopsy and further imaging studies. With respect to infectious diseases, I would order a test for HIV antibodies and a CD4 cell count. I would also order appropriate tests for various infections and would ask an ophthalmologist about the wisdom of obtaining specimens from the eye for culture or serologic testing.I consider systemic lupus erythematosus the most likely diagnosis in this case, but Wegener's granulomatosis or other diseases may have been present. I cannot make a specific diagnosis without the results of laboratory tests for systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, and HIV infection.Dr. Paul A. Boepple: Our predominant concern initially was permanent loss of vision, so we administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic and antiviral agents. Infection was the first consideration in our differential diagnosis, and HIV infection was at the top of the list, with or without opportunistic infections.\n",

      "Pathological Discussion\n",
      "-----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. John L. Niles: I believe this case can best be characterized by two diagnoses, with two corresponding sets of diagnostic test results. One set consisted of serologic findings that supported the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:1280, with a homogeneous pattern. Antibodies to double-stranded DNA were present at a titer of 1:320. The complement values were low: the C3 level was 44 mg per deciliter, the C4 level was less than 10 mg per deciliter, and the total complement level was less than 3 U per milliliter. In addition, the test for antibodies to Sjögren's syndrome was positive, and serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a diffuse increase in immunoglobulins, with a normal distribution. These serologic findings, together with the malar rash, oral ulcers, and lymphopenia, are sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The low complement levels are typical of active systemic lupus erythematosus, with unusually severe ocular manifestations.Dr. Lisa H. Lerner: A superficial shave biopsy of the cheek showed focal parakeratosis and dermatitis with necrotic or dyskeratotic keratinocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. There was no thickening of the basement-membrane zone on routine or periodic acid–Schiff staining, and dermal interstitial mucin was not present. There was swelling and focal degeneration of endothelial cells in small dermal vessels, with a superficial perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltrate, but there were no fibrinoid deposits, which would have supported the diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The findings are consistent with but not diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus.Dr. Niles: The second set of serologic findings included a positive test for ANCA. Indirect immunofluorescence testing showed a perinuclear pattern of staining (p-ANCA), and a test for antibodies to myeloperoxidase was positive, at a titer of 108 units (normal value, less than 2.8). Tests for c-ANCA and for antibodies to proteinase 3 were negative. The presence of antibodies to either myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is highly specific for the group of related vasculitic syndromes that includes Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopical polyangiitis, the Churg–Strauss syndrome, and renal-limited, pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.[25,39–42](#core-r025) In the appropriate clinical setting, the finding of antibodies to myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is virtually diagnostic of this spectrum of disease.[43,44](#core-r043) Two of the most prominent clinical features of this case were the otitis and the ocular findings, which have been described in these diseases and which strongly support a diagnosis of vasculitis consistent with the presence of Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopical polyangiitis.The presence of antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA and hypocomplementemia are not typical features of Wegener's granulomatosis. Similarly, otitis and the presence of ANCA are not typical features of systemic lupus erythematosus. Clearly, the patient had features of both diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus may be associated with a variety of autoantibodies, including those to intracellular and cell-surface antigens, but antibodies to myeloperoxidase are rarely present.[26,45](#core-r026) Wegener's granulomatosis is usually associated with either p-ANCA or c-ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase, but not with other autoantibodies.Dr. Schaller: Only the p-ANCA test was positive in this patient. The test for c-ANCA, the type more often associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, was negative. These findings are also evidence against the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Niles: Twenty percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis have antibodies to myeloperoxidase,[42](#core-r042) and several autoantibodies, including those to myeloperoxidase, may produce the p-ANCA pattern. Among these autoantibodies, only antibodies to myeloperoxidase have been shown to be highly specific for the spectrum of vasculitic disorders that includes Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopical polyangiitis. Thus, although the finding of p-ANCA is not very useful diagnostically by itself, the combination of positive tests for p-ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase is very useful.When a patient has organ-threatening disease, as this patient had in her eye, aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is warranted, whether the disease is due to systemic lupus erythematosus or Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Schaller: From a rheumatologist's point of view, however, the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis differ. This girl needs very aggressive treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus, probably with a combination of drugs, and monitoring of the serum complement and double-stranded DNA antibody levels.Dr. Niles: I agree that monitoring the titers of serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus and ANCA titers will be very useful for the long-term management of her condition.Initially, the patient was treated with the intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone. Because of her age and strong desire to have more children, zidovudine (75 mg per day) was then given, with a slow tapering of prednisone to a low dose. Her condition improved considerably in the months after her hospitalization, with a marked increase in her vision. Her complement levels have become normal, and there has been a large decrease in her ANCA titer.\n",

      "Question: A 16-year-old girl presents with a 3-month history of intermittent fever, fatigue, anorexia with 14 kg weight loss, and a prior dermatomal vesicular rash on the left thigh. Two weeks prior to admission, she developed left ear drainage, followed by painful intraoral lesions and decreased vision in the right eye. Examination reveals a temperature of 39.2°C, pulse of 130, and blood pressure of 110/60 mm Hg. Ocular findings include marked swelling around the right orbit with severe chemosis, diffuse conjunctival infection, tenderness of the sclera, limited visual acuity in the right eye (finger counting at 0.6 m), a large right retinal detachment, minimal erythema of the left eye with slight scleral thickening (visual acuity 20/40), and greenish pus draining from a perforated left tympanic membrane. Oral examination reveals scattered ulcers covered by white exudate on the buccal mucosa and soft palate. Skin examination shows periungual telangiectases, palmar erythema, and hyperpigmented macular lesions on the left anterior thigh in an L2 dermatomal distribution. Laboratory findings include proteinuria (++), hematuria (5-10 RBCs/HPF), pyuria (10-20 WBCs/HPF), hyaline casts (10-20/LPF), a positive serologic test for syphilis (1:2) with a negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum*, a negative tuberculin skin test, and a CT scan showing preseptal swelling of the right eye with diffuse thickening and enhancement of the sclera, and opacified left mastoid air cells. Further testing reveals a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test at 1:1280 with a homogeneous pattern, positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies at 1:320, low C3 and C4 complement levels, positive anti-Sjögren's syndrome antibodies, and a positive perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) test with positive antibodies to myeloperoxidase.

       "{'original': {'question': \"A 16-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of fever, rash, and severe ocular disease.\\nThe patient had been in good health until three months earlier, when small, painful, mildly pruritic vesicles appeared on her left thigh. She was given oral and topical medications, and the rash disappeared within a few days, leaving hyperpigmented scars. Thereafter, she had intermittent fever, fatigue, and anorexia, with a weight loss of 14 kg.\\nTwo weeks before admission, the patient's left ear began to drain. Several days before admission, painful intraoral lesions appeared. One day before admission, clarithromycin was prescribed for recurrent drainage from the left ear, and vision in the right eye decreased markedly. An examination elsewhere showed scleritis and uveitis. Topical erythromycin was administered, and the patient was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient had been born in the United States to Cambodian parents. At the age of 14 years, the patient had given birth to a healthy daughter after an uncomplicated pregnancy. The hematocrit during her pregnancy was 36 percent. There was a history of mild varicella and sex with multiple partners. She had had an abnormal vaginal smear, but repeated smears during the year before admission were negative. She had received medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension intramuscularly for a year, followed by amenorrhea. She had recently noted hair loss. There was no history of tuberculosis or exposure to it or of travel to Cambodia.\\nThe temperature was 39.2°C, the pulse was 130, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\\nThe patient appeared acutely and chronically ill. Examination revealed marked swelling around the right orbit, with severe chemosis, diffuse conjunctival infection, and tenderness of the sclera on palpation. Visual acuity was limited, with an ability to discern the number of fingers held up at a maximal distance of 0.6 m, and extraocular movement was restricted laterally by the chemosis. There was a large right retinal detachment, probably exudative, involving the macula. There was minimal erythema of the left eye, with slight scleral thickening; the fundus appeared normal. Visual acuity was 20/40. Greenish pus issued from a perforation in the left tympanic membrane. The right ear was normal. A few scattered ulcers covered by white exudate were observed on the buccal mucosa and soft palate, and several petechiae were scattered on the soft palate. There was a small amount of exudate on the left tonsil. Examination of the skin showed a few periungual telangiectases, prominent palmar erythema, and hyperpigmented macular lesions on the left anterior thigh in a distribution resembling the L2 dermatome. Slightly atrophic erythematous plaques with silvery scales were present on each upper eyelid and in the right malar region. Shotty posterior cervical and right axillary lymph nodes and left inguinal lymph nodes, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, were palpable. A nonradiating, grade 2 systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border.\\nThe urine was positive (++) for protein. The sediment contained 5 to 10 red cells, 10 to 20 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power field; there were 10 to 20 hyaline casts per low-power field. Other laboratory tests were performed (\\nTable 1\\nand\\nTable 2\\n). A serologic test for syphilis was positive at a titer of 1:2, but a microhemagglutination test for\\nTreponema pallidum\\nwas negative. A tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) and skin tests with mumps and candida antigens were negative at 48 hours. Radiographs of the chest showed normal findings. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head (\\nFigure 1\\n), obtained after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed moderate preseptal swelling of the soft tissue of the right eye, with diffuse thickening and enhancement of the sclera — findings consistent with the presence of scleritis. The left eye appeared normal. The left mastoid air cells were opacified, with minimal sclerosis and prominent sulci.\\nSpecimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and gentamicin, ceftazidime, acyclovir, and methylprednisolone (40 mg daily) were given intravenously. A urine culture yielded rare gram-negative enteric rods, and a culture of drainage fluid from the left ear yielded\\nPseudomonas aeruginosa.\\nMultiple blood cultures were sterile. The temperature peaked daily at 39.3 to 40°C.\\nDiagnostic procedures were performed.\\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?\",\n",
       "  'reasoning': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Jane G. Schaller[\\\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic images?Dr. Robert T. Bramson: The CT scan ([Figure 1](#f01)) of the right eye shows marked thickening of the soft tissue within and around the globe. The frontal, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses appear normal, but the left mastoid air cells are sclerotic and filled with fluid. There is slight, generalized cerebral atrophy. There is no evidence of a space-occupying lesion.Dr. Schaller: Being a rheumatologist, I shall begin with a discussion of rheumatic diseases, although there are no test results that are clearly diagnostic of rheumatic disease in this case. It is crucial in cases of this type to consider specifically treatable diseases that can mimic rheumatic diseases, including infectious diseases, malignant tumors, and other conditions with traumatic or environmental causes. In the present case, the question of infectious disease, particularly varicella–zoster virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, looms large, and a malignant tumor is also possible.Could any one rheumatic disease explain all the findings in this case? Systemic lupus erythematosus could,[1](#core-r001) but we have no information about serum complement levels or important serologic tests, including those for antinuclear antibodies and for antibodies to double-stranded DNA and Sm, Ro, and La antigens. Although antinuclear-antibody–negative lupus has been reported,[2](#core-r002) two negative tests at a good laboratory effectively rule out systemic lupus erythematosus.The diagnostic criteria for lupus are shown in [Table 3](#t03). The malar rash in this patient, although puzzling as described, is consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. A skin biopsy can be helpful diagnostically, since a rash associated with lupus has a characteristic histopathological appearance, although one hesitates to perform a biopsy in highly visible regions, such as the face. The dermatomal vesicular rash that heralded this patient's illness and suggested the presence of varicella–zoster virus is also consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. Lupus-associated rashes may take many forms and may affect any part of the body. A similar vesicular rash with a dermatomal distribution has been described in a teenager with lupus.[3](#core-r003) The patient under discussion had painful intraoral lesions and a renal disorder, with urinary findings that were consistent with the presence of early lupus nephritis. The finding of cerebral atrophy on the CT scan in this case is consistent with the presence of lupus cerebritis.[4](#core-r004) The patient had a hematologic disorder with severe anemia and a positive Coombs' test; her reticulocytosis was only mild, possibly because of the severity of her illness. The description of the blood smear does not help clarify the cause of the anemia, but it does make thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or the hemolytic–uremic syndrome unlikely. The apparent absence of anemia during the patient's pregnancy makes thalassemia or another type of hereditary anemia unlikely. Her low serum iron levels and total iron-binding capacity are consistent with the presence of iron deficiency and chronic disease. The patient had lymphopenia on a differential count; as a criterion for the diagnosis of lupus, lymphopenia is defined as fewer than 1500 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter; her absolute lymphocyte count was 528 per cubic millimeter. She had a biologic false positive serologic test for syphilis, with a negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum.* It would be interesting to know the results of these tests at the time of her pregnancy two years earlier.Even in the absence of information about a test for antinuclear antibodies, this patient's disease appears to meet the diagnostic criteria for lupus. If a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative, however, I would consider lupus an unlikely diagnosis.Are the other clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis of lupus? The most striking component of the eye disease was scleritis. Among patients with rheumatic diseases, scleritis is seen most often in those with rheumatoid factor–positive rheumatoid arthritis[5](#core-r005) or Wegener's granulomatosis[5–9](#core-r005); it is occasionally seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus[10,11](#core-r010) or other conditions, including sarcoidosis, Behçet's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's syndrome, dermatomyositis, polyarteritis nodosa and other forms of vasculitis, and polychondritis.[5,6,9,12–15](#core-r005) This patient also had iridocyclitis and choroiditis, as well as a large right retinal detachment, which was probably related to the posterior scleritis. Many infections can cause scleritis,[16–21](#core-r016) including HIV infection, varicella–zoster virus, Lyme disease, syphilis, and tuberculosis.Other findings consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in this patient include the chronic course of the illness, fever, weight loss, malaise, alopecia, periungual telangiectasia, palmar erythema, shotty lymphadenopathy, and petechiae on the soft palate. Laboratory findings that are consistent with the diagnosis, in addition to those already mentioned, include the very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels, the elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, the very high level of ferritin (which may have been acting as an acute-phase reactant), and the elevated globulin fraction, with a reversal of the ratio of albumin to globulin. The slight hypocalcemia may be related to the low serum albumin level.Ear drainage is a nonspecific finding for systemic lupus erythematosus. The radiographs suggest the presence of a chronic process in the ear and mastoid that is unrelated to the current illness. In summary, nearly all the clinical and laboratory findings are consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.The findings in this case are also consistent with the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, although the disorder is rare in young people.[22,23](#core-r022) Features that suggest this diagnosis include the drainage from the ear, the oral ulcers, the abnormal results of urinalysis, the scleritis, and the debilitating nature of the chronic febrile illness. The criteria for the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis are shown in [Table 4](#t04).[24](#core-r024) This patient had oral ulcers. She had no nasal involvement, but she did have involvement of the ear, mastoid, and sinuses, which occurs in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. The findings on the chest radiograph were normal, but microhematuria was present. Although ocular involvement is not a diagnostic criterion, severe scleritis occurs in up to 16 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis.[5–9](#core-r005) Of most immediate interest diagnostically would be the results of a test for antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). The cytoplasmic type of ANCA (c-ANCA) is present in about 80 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and is characteristic of the disorder.[25,26](#core-r025) A few features of this case that are not suggestive of the diagnosis, however, are the facial rash, the positive Coombs' test, and the biologic false positive test for syphilis.Behçet's disease can cause oral ulcers and ocular disease ([Table 5](#t05)),[27](#core-r027) but the latter is most often manifested as uveitis, retinitis, or both[13](#core-r013); scleritis is rare. This patient did not have recurrent genital ulcers, a common feature of Behçet's disease. The rash resembling varicella–zoster was probably not the papulopustular lesion characteristic of Behçet's disease. Finally, Behçet's disease is not associated with hemolytic anemia or a biologic false positive test for syphilis, two findings reported in this case.Sarcoidosis[14,28](#core-r014) can cause uveitis, anergy on delayed-hypersensitivity testing, elevated liver-function values, renal involvement, and occasionally scleritis, although it is not the usual form of eye disease. However, the degree of anemia reported in this case is atypical of sarcoidosis. The angiotensin-converting–enzyme level was normal in this case, but it is elevated in only about 60 percent of cases of sarcoidosis. Chest involvement, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, arthritis, and erythema nodosum, which are common findings in cases of sarcoidosis, were absent in this case.Two types of spondyloarthropathy should also be mentioned.[15,29](#core-r015) Reiter's syndrome could account for the prolonged febrile illness, the oral ulcers, and even the urinary findings, but the eye disease associated with Reiter's syndrome is generally conjunctivitis, keratitis, or acute iritis, not scleritis. Furthermore, this patient had no musculoskeletal involvement, a hallmark of Reiter's syndrome. Inflammatory bowel disease, notably Crohn's disease, can present in young people without gastrointestinal symptoms. It can be associated with mouth sores and a prolonged febrile illness and can cause scleritis,[15](#core-r015) but the serologic findings in this case are not consistent with the presence of Crohn's disease.Polyarteritis is a diagnostic consideration, but it is usually not associated with a positive Coombs' test or a biologic false positive test for syphilis. Other rheumatic conditions that have been associated with scleritis include seropositive rheumatoid arthritis,[30](#core-r030) for which there is no clinical evidence in this case, and dermatomyositis,[31](#core-r031) which could explain the patient's facial and periungual rashes. Although she had no history of myalgia or muscle weakness, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels could be due to muscle disease rather than liver disease.It is very important to consider specifically treatable diseases, such as infectious diseases, before diagnosing a rheumatic disease, since treatments for rheumatic diseases are nonspecific and may mask the symptoms and signs of infectious diseases. Could an infectious disease explain all the findings in this case, or at least some of them, such as the ear drainage and the ocular disease? The negative blood cultures make bacterial sepsis unlikely.The patient probably also had herpes zoster, although only about 5 percent of cases occur before the age of 16 years.[32](#core-r032) In children with herpes zoster, a predisposing disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, an immunodeficiency disorder, or a malignant tumor should be considered. Varicella–zoster virus can cause ocular disease,[19](#core-r019) which is occasionally manifested as scleritis; it can involve the liver, with slightly elevated liver-function values, and can cause a prolonged febrile illness, particularly in a predisposed host. This girl had a history of chickenpox. There is evidence that chickenpox in infancy may be associated with zoster during later childhood,[33](#core-r033) but herpes zoster alone would not explain the positive Coombs' test, the severe anemia, or the false positive serologic test for syphilis. The administration of acyclovir on admission indicates that the patient's physicians also thought of varicella–zoster as either a cause of her illness or a factor contributing to it.Dr. Quan D. Nguyen: The initial lesions on the patient's face and around her right eye were herpetic. We were very concerned about the possibility of systemic herpetic infection and decided to administer intravenous acyclovir as part of the initial treatment.Dr. Schaller: HIV infection could cause all the features of this patient's disease, including the serologic abnormalities.[18,34–37](#core-r018) Indeed, at times HIV infection is difficult to distinguish from systemic lupus erythematosus, because patients with HIV infection may have autoantibodies, patients with lupus may have antibodies to HIV, and in rare cases systemic lupus erythematosus and HIV infection coexist. Rashes and nephritis can occur in patients with HIV infection. Retinitis with cotton-wool exudates is the usual form of ocular involvement, but secondary infection with cytomegalovirus, *T. pallidum,* mycobacteria, various fungi, or pseudomonas can affect any part of the eye.Could any other infectious diseases have had a role in this case?[16–21](#core-r016) The chronic otitis with drainage could have had an infectious origin. The patient had not been exposed to tuberculosis, and her chest film showed normal findings. The negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum* rules out syphilis as a cause. Infection with Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, or various fungi could conceivably have accounted for some or all of the findings.Finally, the possibility of a malignant tumor must be considered. Lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, malignant histiocytosis, leukemia, lymphomatoid granulomatosis,[9](#core-r009) angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions indicative of T-cell dysfunction, and neuroblastoma come to mind. All these disorders can cause fever and multisystem disease and can affect the eye, although the combination of scleritis and uveitis would be unusual. Chronic ear drainage such as this patient had often occurs in histiocytosis.[38](#core-r038)If I were this patient's physician, I would begin by ordering the appropriate serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus; the results of a test for antinuclear antibodies should be available within a day. If the test were positive, at a high titer, and no other serologic abnormalities were found, there would be no need to perform biopsies to establish a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. I would also request an ANCA test. To rule out a malignant tumor, I would examine a blood smear and consider a bone marrow biopsy and further imaging studies. With respect to infectious diseases, I would order a test for HIV antibodies and a CD4 cell count. I would also order appropriate tests for various infections and would ask an ophthalmologist about the wisdom of obtaining specimens from the eye for culture or serologic testing.I consider systemic lupus erythematosus the most likely diagnosis in this case, but Wegener's granulomatosis or other diseases may have been present. I cannot make a specific diagnosis without the results of laboratory tests for systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, and HIV infection.Dr. Paul A. Boepple: Our predominant concern initially was permanent loss of vision, so we administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic and antiviral agents. Infection was the first consideration in our differential diagnosis, and HIV infection was at the top of the list, with or without opportunistic infections.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. John L. Niles: I believe this case can best be characterized by two diagnoses, with two corresponding sets of diagnostic test results. One set consisted of serologic findings that supported the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:1280, with a homogeneous pattern. Antibodies to double-stranded DNA were present at a titer of 1:320. The complement values were low: the C3 level was 44 mg per deciliter, the C4 level was less than 10 mg per deciliter, and the total complement level was less than 3 U per milliliter. In addition, the test for antibodies to Sjögren's syndrome was positive, and serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a diffuse increase in immunoglobulins, with a normal distribution. These serologic findings, together with the malar rash, oral ulcers, and lymphopenia, are sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The low complement levels are typical of active systemic lupus erythematosus, with unusually severe ocular manifestations.Dr. Lisa H. Lerner: A superficial shave biopsy of the cheek showed focal parakeratosis and dermatitis with necrotic or dyskeratotic keratinocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. There was no thickening of the basement-membrane zone on routine or periodic acid–Schiff staining, and dermal interstitial mucin was not present. There was swelling and focal degeneration of endothelial cells in small dermal vessels, with a superficial perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltrate, but there were no fibrinoid deposits, which would have supported the diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The findings are consistent with but not diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus.Dr. Niles: The second set of serologic findings included a positive test for ANCA. Indirect immunofluorescence testing showed a perinuclear pattern of staining (p-ANCA), and a test for antibodies to myeloperoxidase was positive, at a titer of 108 units (normal value, less than 2.8). Tests for c-ANCA and for antibodies to proteinase 3 were negative. The presence of antibodies to either myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is highly specific for the group of related vasculitic syndromes that includes Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopical polyangiitis, the Churg–Strauss syndrome, and renal-limited, pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.[25,39–42](#core-r025) In the appropriate clinical setting, the finding of antibodies to myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is virtually diagnostic of this spectrum of disease.[43,44](#core-r043) Two of the most prominent clinical features of this case were the otitis and the ocular findings, which have been described in these diseases and which strongly support a diagnosis of vasculitis consistent with the presence of Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopical polyangiitis.The presence of antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA and hypocomplementemia are not typical features of Wegener's granulomatosis. Similarly, otitis and the presence of ANCA are not typical features of systemic lupus erythematosus. Clearly, the patient had features of both diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus may be associated with a variety of autoantibodies, including those to intracellular and cell-surface antigens, but antibodies to myeloperoxidase are rarely present.[26,45](#core-r026) Wegener's granulomatosis is usually associated with either p-ANCA or c-ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase, but not with other autoantibodies.Dr. Schaller: Only the p-ANCA test was positive in this patient. The test for c-ANCA, the type more often associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, was negative. These findings are also evidence against the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Niles: Twenty percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis have antibodies to myeloperoxidase,[42](#core-r042) and several autoantibodies, including those to myeloperoxidase, may produce the p-ANCA pattern. Among these autoantibodies, only antibodies to myeloperoxidase have been shown to be highly specific for the spectrum of vasculitic disorders that includes Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopical polyangiitis. Thus, although the finding of p-ANCA is not very useful diagnostically by itself, the combination of positive tests for p-ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase is very useful.When a patient has organ-threatening disease, as this patient had in her eye, aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is warranted, whether the disease is due to systemic lupus erythematosus or Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Schaller: From a rheumatologist's point of view, however, the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis differ. This girl needs very aggressive treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus, probably with a combination of drugs, and monitoring of the serum complement and double-stranded DNA antibody levels.Dr. Niles: I agree that monitoring the titers of serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus and ANCA titers will be very useful for the long-term management of her condition.Initially, the patient was treated with the intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone. Because of her age and strong desire to have more children, zidovudine (75 mg per day) was then given, with a slow tapering of prednisone to a low dose. Her condition improved considerably in the months after her hospitalization, with a marked increase in her vision. Her complement levels have become normal, and there has been a large decrease in her ANCA titer.\\n\",\n",

She was given oral and topical medications, and the rash disappeared within a few days, leaving hyperpigmented scars. Thereafter, she had intermittent fever, fatigue, and anorexia, with a weight loss of 14 kg.\\nTwo weeks before admission, the patient's left ear began to drain. Several days before admission, painful intraoral lesions appeared. One day before admission, clarithromycin was prescribed for recurrent drainage from the left ear, and vision in the right eye decreased markedly. An examination elsewhere showed scleritis and uveitis. Topical erythromycin was administered, and the patient was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient had been born in the United States to Cambodian parents. At the age of 14 years, the patient had given birth to a healthy daughter after an uncomplicated pregnancy. The hematocrit during her pregnancy was 36 percent. There was a history of mild varicella and sex with multiple partners. She had had an abnormal vaginal smear, but repeated smears during the year before admission were negative. She had received medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension intramuscularly for a year, followed by amenorrhea. She had recently noted hair loss.

Examination revealed marked swelling around the right orbit, with severe chemosis, diffuse conjunctival infection, and tenderness of the sclera on palpation. Visual acuity was limited, with an ability to discern the number of fingers held up at a maximal distance of 0.6 m, and extraocular movement was restricted laterally by the chemosis. There was a large right retinal detachment, probably exudative, involving the macula. There was minimal erythema of the left eye, with slight scleral thickening; the fundus appeared normal. Visual acuity was 20/40. Greenish pus issued from a perforation in the left tympanic membrane. The right ear was normal. A few scattered ulcers covered by white exudate were observed on the buccal mucosa and soft palate, and several petechiae were scattered on the soft palate. There was a small amount of exudate on the left tonsil. Examination of the skin showed a few periungual telangiectases, prominent palmar erythema, and hyperpigmented macular lesions on the left anterior thigh in a distribution resembling the L2 dermatome. Slightly atrophic erythematous plaques with silvery scales were present on each upper eyelid and in the right malar region. Shotty posterior cervical and right axillary lymph nodes and left inguinal lymph nodes, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, were palpable. A nonradiating, grade 2 systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border.\\nThe urine was positive (++) for protein. The sediment contained 5 to 10 red cells, 10 to 20 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power field; there were 10 to 20 hyaline casts per low-power field. Other laboratory tests were performed (\\nTable 1\\nand\\nTable 2\\n). A serologic test for syphilis was positive at a titer of 1:2, but a microhemagglutination test for\\nTreponema pallidum\\nwas negative. A tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) and skin tests with mumps and candida antigens were negative at 48 hours. Radiographs of the chest showed normal findings. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head (\\nFigure 1\\n), obtained after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed moderate preseptal swelling of the soft tissue of the right eye, with diffuse thickening and enhancement of the sclera — findings consistent with the presence of scleritis. The left eye appeared normal. The left mastoid air cells were opacified, with minimal sclerosis and prominent sulci.\\nSpecimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and gentamicin, ceftazidime, acyclovir, and methylprednisolone (40 mg daily) were given intravenously. A urine culture yielded rare gram-negative enteric rods, and a culture of drainage fluid from the left ear yielded\\nPseudomonas aeruginosa.\\nMultiple blood cultures were sterile. The temperature peaked daily at 39.3 to 40°C.\\nDiagnostic procedures were performed.\\nWhat is the diagnosis of the patient?\",\n",
       "   'reasoning': \"\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n----------------------\\n\\nDr. Jane G. Schaller[\\\\*](#FN1): May we review the radiologic images?Dr. Robert T. Bramson: The CT scan ([Figure 1](#f01)) of the right eye shows marked thickening of the soft tissue within and around the globe. The frontal, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses appear normal, but the left mastoid air cells are sclerotic and filled with fluid. There is slight, generalized cerebral atrophy. There is no evidence of a space-occupying lesion.Dr. Schaller: Being a rheumatologist, I shall begin with a discussion of rheumatic diseases, although there are no test results that are clearly diagnostic of rheumatic disease in this case. It is crucial in cases of this type to consider specifically treatable diseases that can mimic rheumatic diseases, including infectious diseases, malignant tumors, and other conditions with traumatic or environmental causes. In the present case, the question of infectious disease, particularly varicella–zoster virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, looms large, and a malignant tumor is also possible.Could any one rheumatic disease explain all the findings in this case? Systemic lupus erythematosus could,[1](#core-r001) but we have no information about serum complement levels or important serologic tests, including those for antinuclear antibodies and for antibodies to double-stranded DNA and Sm, Ro, and La antigens. Although antinuclear-antibody–negative lupus has been reported,[2](#core-r002) two negative tests at a good laboratory effectively rule out systemic lupus erythematosus.The diagnostic criteria for lupus are shown in [Table 3](#t03). The malar rash in this patient, although puzzling as described, is consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. A skin biopsy can be helpful diagnostically, since a rash associated with lupus has a characteristic histopathological appearance, although one hesitates to perform a biopsy in highly visible regions, such as the face. The dermatomal vesicular rash that heralded this patient's illness and suggested the presence of varicella–zoster virus is also consistent with the diagnosis of lupus. Lupus-associated rashes may take many forms and may affect any part of the body. A similar vesicular rash with a dermatomal distribution has been described in a teenager with lupus.[3](#core-r003) The patient under discussion had painful intraoral lesions and a renal disorder, with urinary findings that were consistent with the presence of early lupus nephritis. The finding of cerebral atrophy on the CT scan in this case is consistent with the presence of lupus cerebritis.[4](#core-r004) The patient had a hematologic disorder with severe anemia and a positive Coombs' test; her reticulocytosis was only mild, possibly because of the severity of her illness. The description of the blood smear does not help clarify the cause of the anemia, but it does make thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or the hemolytic–uremic syndrome unlikely. The apparent absence of anemia during the patient's pregnancy makes thalassemia or another type of hereditary anemia unlikely. Her low serum iron levels and total iron-binding capacity are consistent with the presence of iron deficiency and chronic disease. The patient had lymphopenia on a differential count; as a criterion for the diagnosis of lupus, lymphopenia is defined as fewer than 1500 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter; her absolute lymphocyte count was 528 per cubic millimeter. She had a biologic false positive serologic test for syphilis, with a negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum.* It would be interesting to know the results of these tests at the time of her pregnancy two years earlier.Even in the absence of information about a test for antinuclear antibodies, this patient's disease appears to meet the diagnostic criteria for lupus. If a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative, however, I would consider lupus an unlikely diagnosis.Are the other clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis of lupus? The most striking component of the eye disease was scleritis. Among patients with rheumatic diseases, scleritis is seen most often in those with rheumatoid factor–positive rheumatoid arthritis[5](#core-r005) or Wegener's granulomatosis[5–9](#core-r005); it is occasionally seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus[10,11](#core-r010) or other conditions, including sarcoidosis, Behçet's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's syndrome, dermatomyositis, polyarteritis nodosa and other forms of vasculitis, and polychondritis.[5,6,9,12–15](#core-r005) This patient also had iridocyclitis and choroiditis, as well as a large right retinal detachment, which was probably related to the posterior scleritis. Many infections can cause scleritis,[16–21](#core-r016) including HIV infection, varicella–zoster virus, Lyme disease, syphilis, and tuberculosis.Other findings consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in this patient include the chronic course of the illness, fever, weight loss, malaise, alopecia, periungual telangiectasia, palmar erythema, shotty lymphadenopathy, and petechiae on the soft palate. Laboratory findings that are consistent with the diagnosis, in addition to those already mentioned, include the very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels, the elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, the very high level of ferritin (which may have been acting as an acute-phase reactant), and the elevated globulin fraction, with a reversal of the ratio of albumin to globulin. The slight hypocalcemia may be related to the low serum albumin level.Ear drainage is a nonspecific finding for systemic lupus erythematosus. The radiographs suggest the presence of a chronic process in the ear and mastoid that is unrelated to the current illness. In summary, nearly all the clinical and laboratory findings are consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.The findings in this case are also consistent with the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, although the disorder is rare in young people.[22,23](#core-r022) Features that suggest this diagnosis include the drainage from the ear, the oral ulcers, the abnormal results of urinalysis, the scleritis, and the debilitating nature of the chronic febrile illness. The criteria for the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis are shown in [Table 4](#t04).[24](#core-r024) This patient had oral ulcers. She had no nasal involvement, but she did have involvement of the ear, mastoid, and sinuses, which occurs in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. The findings on the chest radiograph were normal, but microhematuria was present. Although ocular involvement is not a diagnostic criterion, severe scleritis occurs in up to 16 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis.[5–9](#core-r005) Of most immediate interest diagnostically would be the results of a test for antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). The cytoplasmic type of ANCA (c-ANCA) is present in about 80 percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and is characteristic of the disorder.[25,26](#core-r025) A few features of this case that are not suggestive of the diagnosis, however, are the facial rash, the positive Coombs' test, and the biologic false positive test for syphilis.Behçet's disease can cause oral ulcers and ocular disease ([Table 5](#t05)),[27](#core-r027) but the latter is most often manifested as uveitis, retinitis, or both[13](#core-r013); scleritis is rare. This patient did not have recurrent genital ulcers, a common feature of Behçet's disease. The rash resembling varicella–zoster was probably not the papulopustular lesion characteristic of Behçet's disease. Finally, Behçet's disease is not associated with hemolytic anemia or a biologic false positive test for syphilis, two findings reported in this case.Sarcoidosis[14,28](#core-r014) can cause uveitis, anergy on delayed-hypersensitivity testing, elevated liver-function values, renal involvement, and occasionally scleritis, although it is not the usual form of eye disease. However, the degree of anemia reported in this case is atypical of sarcoidosis. The angiotensin-converting–enzyme level was normal in this case, but it is elevated in only about 60 percent of cases of sarcoidosis. Chest involvement, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, arthritis, and erythema nodosum, which are common findings in cases of sarcoidosis, were absent in this case.Two types of spondyloarthropathy should also be mentioned.[15,29](#core-r015) Reiter's syndrome could account for the prolonged febrile illness, the oral ulcers, and even the urinary findings, but the eye disease associated with Reiter's syndrome is generally conjunctivitis, keratitis, or acute iritis, not scleritis. Furthermore, this patient had no musculoskeletal involvement, a hallmark of Reiter's syndrome. Inflammatory bowel disease, notably Crohn's disease, can present in young people without gastrointestinal symptoms. It can be associated with mouth sores and a prolonged febrile illness and can cause scleritis,[15](#core-r015) but the serologic findings in this case are not consistent with the presence of Crohn's disease.Polyarteritis is a diagnostic consideration, but it is usually not associated with a positive Coombs' test or a biologic false positive test for syphilis. Other rheumatic conditions that have been associated with scleritis include seropositive rheumatoid arthritis,[30](#core-r030) for which there is no clinical evidence in this case, and dermatomyositis,[31](#core-r031) which could explain the patient's facial and periungual rashes. Although she had no history of myalgia or muscle weakness, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels could be due to muscle disease rather than liver disease.It is very important to consider specifically treatable diseases, such as infectious diseases, before diagnosing a rheumatic disease, since treatments for rheumatic diseases are nonspecific and may mask the symptoms and signs of infectious diseases. Could an infectious disease explain all the findings in this case, or at least some of them, such as the ear drainage and the ocular disease? The negative blood cultures make bacterial sepsis unlikely.The patient probably also had herpes zoster, although only about 5 percent of cases occur before the age of 16 years.[32](#core-r032) In children with herpes zoster, a predisposing disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, an immunodeficiency disorder, or a malignant tumor should be considered. Varicella–zoster virus can cause ocular disease,[19](#core-r019) which is occasionally manifested as scleritis; it can involve the liver, with slightly elevated liver-function values, and can cause a prolonged febrile illness, particularly in a predisposed host. This girl had a history of chickenpox. There is evidence that chickenpox in infancy may be associated with zoster during later childhood,[33](#core-r033) but herpes zoster alone would not explain the positive Coombs' test, the severe anemia, or the false positive serologic test for syphilis. The administration of acyclovir on admission indicates that the patient's physicians also thought of varicella–zoster as either a cause of her illness or a factor contributing to it.Dr. Quan D. Nguyen: The initial lesions on the patient's face and around her right eye were herpetic. We were very concerned about the possibility of systemic herpetic infection and decided to administer intravenous acyclovir as part of the initial treatment.Dr. Schaller: HIV infection could cause all the features of this patient's disease, including the serologic abnormalities.[18,34–37](#core-r018) Indeed, at times HIV infection is difficult to distinguish from systemic lupus erythematosus, because patients with HIV infection may have autoantibodies, patients with lupus may have antibodies to HIV, and in rare cases systemic lupus erythematosus and HIV infection coexist. Rashes and nephritis can occur in patients with HIV infection. Retinitis with cotton-wool exudates is the usual form of ocular involvement, but secondary infection with cytomegalovirus, *T. pallidum,* mycobacteria, various fungi, or pseudomonas can affect any part of the eye.Could any other infectious diseases have had a role in this case?[16–21](#core-r016) The chronic otitis with drainage could have had an infectious origin. The patient had not been exposed to tuberculosis, and her chest film showed normal findings. The negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum* rules out syphilis as a cause. Infection with Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, or various fungi could conceivably have accounted for some or all of the findings.Finally, the possibility of a malignant tumor must be considered. Lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, malignant histiocytosis, leukemia, lymphomatoid granulomatosis,[9](#core-r009) angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions indicative of T-cell dysfunction, and neuroblastoma come to mind. All these disorders can cause fever and multisystem disease and can affect the eye, although the combination of scleritis and uveitis would be unusual. Chronic ear drainage such as this patient had often occurs in histiocytosis.[38](#core-r038)If I were this patient's physician, I would begin by ordering the appropriate serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus; the results of a test for antinuclear antibodies should be available within a day. If the test were positive, at a high titer, and no other serologic abnormalities were found, there would be no need to perform biopsies to establish a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. I would also request an ANCA test. To rule out a malignant tumor, I would examine a blood smear and consider a bone marrow biopsy and further imaging studies. With respect to infectious diseases, I would order a test for HIV antibodies and a CD4 cell count. I would also order appropriate tests for various infections and would ask an ophthalmologist about the wisdom of obtaining specimens from the eye for culture or serologic testing.I consider systemic lupus erythematosus the most likely diagnosis in this case, but Wegener's granulomatosis or other diseases may have been present. I cannot make a specific diagnosis without the results of laboratory tests for systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, and HIV infection.Dr. Paul A. Boepple: Our predominant concern initially was permanent loss of vision, so we administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic and antiviral agents. Infection was the first consideration in our differential diagnosis, and HIV infection was at the top of the list, with or without opportunistic infections.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. John L. Niles: I believe this case can best be characterized by two diagnoses, with two corresponding sets of diagnostic test results. One set consisted of serologic findings that supported the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:1280, with a homogeneous pattern. Antibodies to double-stranded DNA were present at a titer of 1:320. The complement values were low: the C3 level was 44 mg per deciliter, the C4 level was less than 10 mg per deciliter, and the total complement level was less than 3 U per milliliter. In addition, the test for antibodies to Sjögren's syndrome was positive, and serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a diffuse increase in immunoglobulins, with a normal distribution. These serologic findings, together with the malar rash, oral ulcers, and lymphopenia, are sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The low complement levels are typical of active systemic lupus erythematosus, with unusually severe ocular manifestations.Dr. Lisa H. Lerner: A superficial shave biopsy of the cheek showed focal parakeratosis and dermatitis with necrotic or dyskeratotic keratinocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. There was no thickening of the basement-membrane zone on routine or periodic acid–Schiff staining, and dermal interstitial mucin was not present. There was swelling and focal degeneration of endothelial cells in small dermal vessels, with a superficial perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltrate, but there were no fibrinoid deposits, which would have supported the diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The findings are consistent with but not diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus.Dr. Niles: The second set of serologic findings included a positive test for ANCA. Indirect immunofluorescence testing showed a perinuclear pattern of staining (p-ANCA), and a test for antibodies to myeloperoxidase was positive, at a titer of 108 units (normal value, less than 2.8). Tests for c-ANCA and for antibodies to proteinase 3 were negative. The presence of antibodies to either myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is highly specific for the group of related vasculitic syndromes that includes Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopical polyangiitis, the Churg–Strauss syndrome, and renal-limited, pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.[25,39–42](#core-r025) In the appropriate clinical setting, the finding of antibodies to myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is virtually diagnostic of this spectrum of disease.[43,44](#core-r043) Two of the most prominent clinical features of this case were the otitis and the ocular findings, which have been described in these diseases and which strongly support a diagnosis of vasculitis consistent with the presence of Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopical polyangiitis.The presence of antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA and hypocomplementemia are not typical features of Wegener's granulomatosis. Similarly, otitis and the presence of ANCA are not typical features of systemic lupus erythematosus. Clearly, the patient had features of both diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus may be associated with a variety of autoantibodies, including those to intracellular and cell-surface antigens, but antibodies to myeloperoxidase are rarely present.[26,45](#core-r026) Wegener's granulomatosis is usually associated with either p-ANCA or c-ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase, but not with other autoantibodies.Dr. Schaller: Only the p-ANCA test was positive in this patient. The test for c-ANCA, the type more often associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, was negative. These findings are also evidence against the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Niles: Twenty percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis have antibodies to myeloperoxidase,[42](#core-r042) and several autoantibodies, including those to myeloperoxidase, may produce the p-ANCA pattern. Among these autoantibodies, only antibodies to myeloperoxidase have been shown to be highly specific for the spectrum of vasculitic disorders that includes Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopical polyangiitis. Thus, although the finding of p-ANCA is not very useful diagnostically by itself, the combination of positive tests for p-ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase is very useful.When a patient has organ-threatening disease, as this patient had in her eye, aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is warranted, whether the disease is due to systemic lupus erythematosus or Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Schaller: From a rheumatologist's point of view, however, the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis differ. This girl needs very aggressive treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus, probably with a combination of drugs, and monitoring of the serum complement and double-stranded DNA antibody levels.Dr. Niles: I agree that monitoring the titers of serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus and ANCA titers will be very useful for the long-term management of her condition.Initially, the patient was treated with the intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone. Because of her age and strong desire to have more children, zidovudine (75 mg per day) was then given, with a slow tapering of prednisone to a low dose. Her condition improved considerably in the months after her hospitalization, with a marked increase in her vision. Her complement levels have become normal, and there has been a large decrease in her ANCA titer.\\n\",\n",

Examination reveals a temperature of 39.2°C, pulse of 130, and blood pressure of 110/60 mm Hg. Ocular findings include marked swelling around the right orbit with severe chemosis, diffuse conjunctival infection, tenderness of the sclera, limited visual acuity in the right eye (finger counting at 0.6 m), a large right retinal detachment, minimal erythema of the left eye with slight scleral thickening (visual acuity 20/40), and greenish pus draining from a perforated left tympanic membrane.

Many infections can cause scleritis,[16–21](#core-r016) including HIV infection, varicella–zoster virus, Lyme disease, syphilis, and tuberculosis.Other findings consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in this patient include the chronic course of the illness, fever, weight loss, malaise, alopecia, periungual telangiectasia, palmar erythema, shotty lymphadenopathy, and petechiae on the soft palate.

Furthermore, this patient had no musculoskeletal involvement, a hallmark of Reiter's syndrome. Inflammatory bowel disease, notably Crohn's disease, can present in young people without gastrointestinal symptoms. It can be associated with mouth sores and a prolonged febrile illness and can cause scleritis,[15](#core-r015) but the serologic findings in this case are not consistent with the presence of Crohn's disease.Polyarteritis is a diagnostic consideration, but it is usually not associated with a positive Coombs' test or a biologic false positive test for syphilis. Other rheumatic conditions that have been associated with scleritis include seropositive rheumatoid arthritis,[30](#core-r030) for which there is no clinical evidence in this case, and dermatomyositis,[31](#core-r031) which could explain the patient's facial and periungual rashes. Although she had no history of myalgia or muscle weakness, the slightly elevated aminotransferase levels could be due to muscle disease rather than liver disease.It is very important to consider specifically treatable diseases, such as infectious diseases, before diagnosing a rheumatic disease, since treatments for rheumatic diseases are nonspecific and may mask the symptoms and signs of infectious diseases. Could an infectious disease explain all the findings in this case, or at least some of them, such as the ear drainage and the ocular disease? The negative blood cultures make bacterial sepsis unlikely.The patient probably also had herpes zoster, although only about 5 percent of cases occur before the age of 16 years.[32](#core-r032) In children with herpes zoster, a predisposing disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, an immunodeficiency disorder, or a malignant tumor should be considered. Varicella–zoster virus can cause ocular disease,[19](#core-r019) which is occasionally manifested as scleritis; it can involve the liver, with slightly elevated liver-function values, and can cause a prolonged febrile illness, particularly in a predisposed host. This girl had a history of chickenpox. There is evidence that chickenpox in infancy may be associated with zoster during later childhood,[33](#core-r033) but herpes zoster alone would not explain the positive Coombs' test, the severe anemia, or the false positive serologic test for syphilis. The administration of acyclovir on admission indicates that the patient's physicians also thought of varicella–zoster as either a cause of her illness or a factor contributing to it.Dr. Quan D. Nguyen: The initial lesions on the patient's face and around her right eye were herpetic. We were very concerned about the possibility of systemic herpetic infection and decided to administer intravenous acyclovir as part of the initial treatment.Dr. Schaller: HIV infection could cause all the features of this patient's disease, including the serologic abnormalities.[18,34–37](#core-r018) Indeed, at times HIV infection is difficult to distinguish from systemic lupus erythematosus, because patients with HIV infection may have autoantibodies, patients with lupus may have antibodies to HIV, and in rare cases systemic lupus erythematosus and HIV infection coexist. Rashes and nephritis can occur in patients with HIV infection. Retinitis with cotton-wool exudates is the usual form of ocular involvement, but secondary infection with cytomegalovirus, *T. pallidum,* mycobacteria, various fungi, or pseudomonas can affect any part of the eye.Could any other infectious diseases have had a role in this case?[16–21](#core-r016) The chronic otitis with drainage could have had an infectious origin. The patient had not been exposed to tuberculosis, and her chest film showed normal findings. The negative microhemagglutination test for *T. pallidum* rules out syphilis as a cause. Infection with Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, or various fungi could conceivably have accounted for some or all of the findings.Finally, the possibility of a malignant tumor must be considered. Lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, malignant histiocytosis, leukemia, lymphomatoid granulomatosis,[9](#core-r009) angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions indicative of T-cell dysfunction, and neuroblastoma come to mind. All these disorders can cause fever and multisystem disease and can affect the eye, although the combination of scleritis and uveitis would be unusual. Chronic ear drainage such as this patient had often occurs in histiocytosis.[38](#core-r038)If I were this patient's physician, I would begin by ordering the appropriate serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus; the results of a test for antinuclear antibodies should be available within a day. If the test were positive, at a high titer, and no other serologic abnormalities were found, there would be no need to perform biopsies to establish a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. I would also request an ANCA test. To rule out a malignant tumor, I would examine a blood smear and consider a bone marrow biopsy and further imaging studies. With respect to infectious diseases, I would order a test for HIV antibodies and a CD4 cell count. I would also order appropriate tests for various infections and would ask an ophthalmologist about the wisdom of obtaining specimens from the eye for culture or serologic testing.I consider systemic lupus erythematosus the most likely diagnosis in this case, but Wegener's granulomatosis or other diseases may have been present. I cannot make a specific diagnosis without the results of laboratory tests for systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, and HIV infection.Dr. Paul A. Boepple: Our predominant concern initially was permanent loss of vision, so we administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic and antiviral agents. Infection was the first consideration in our differential diagnosis, and HIV infection was at the top of the list, with or without opportunistic infections.\\n\\nPathological Discussion\\n-----------------------\\n\\nDr. John L. Niles: I believe this case can best be characterized by two diagnoses, with two corresponding sets of diagnostic test results. One set consisted of serologic findings that supported the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:1280, with a homogeneous pattern. Antibodies to double-stranded DNA were present at a titer of 1:320. The complement values were low: the C3 level was 44 mg per deciliter, the C4 level was less than 10 mg per deciliter, and the total complement level was less than 3 U per milliliter. In addition, the test for antibodies to Sjögren's syndrome was positive, and serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a diffuse increase in immunoglobulins, with a normal distribution. These serologic findings, together with the malar rash, oral ulcers, and lymphopenia, are sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The low complement levels are typical of active systemic lupus erythematosus, with unusually severe ocular manifestations.Dr. Lisa H. Lerner: A superficial shave biopsy of the cheek showed focal parakeratosis and dermatitis with necrotic or dyskeratotic keratinocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. There was no thickening of the basement-membrane zone on routine or periodic acid–Schiff staining, and dermal interstitial mucin was not present. There was swelling and focal degeneration of endothelial cells in small dermal vessels, with a superficial perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltrate, but there were no fibrinoid deposits, which would have supported the diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The findings are consistent with but not diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus.Dr. Niles: The second set of serologic findings included a positive test for ANCA. Indirect immunofluorescence testing showed a perinuclear pattern of staining (p-ANCA), and a test for antibodies to myeloperoxidase was positive, at a titer of 108 units (normal value, less than 2.8). Tests for c-ANCA and for antibodies to proteinase 3 were negative. The presence of antibodies to either myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is highly specific for the group of related vasculitic syndromes that includes Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopical polyangiitis, the Churg–Strauss syndrome, and renal-limited, pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.[25,39–42](#core-r025) In the appropriate clinical setting, the finding of antibodies to myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3 is virtually diagnostic of this spectrum of disease.[43,44](#core-r043) Two of the most prominent clinical features of this case were the otitis and the ocular findings, which have been described in these diseases and which strongly support a diagnosis of vasculitis consistent with the presence of Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopical polyangiitis.The presence of antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA and hypocomplementemia are not typical features of Wegener's granulomatosis. Similarly, otitis and the presence of ANCA are not typical features of systemic lupus erythematosus. Clearly, the patient had features of both diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus may be associated with a variety of autoantibodies, including those to intracellular and cell-surface antigens, but antibodies to myeloperoxidase are rarely present.[26,45](#core-r026) Wegener's granulomatosis is usually associated with either p-ANCA or c-ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase, but not with other autoantibodies.Dr. Schaller: Only the p-ANCA test was positive in this patient. The test for c-ANCA, the type more often associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, was negative. These findings are also evidence against the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Niles: Twenty percent of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis have antibodies to myeloperoxidase,[42](#core-r042) and several autoantibodies, including those to myeloperoxidase, may produce the p-ANCA pattern. Among these autoantibodies, only antibodies to myeloperoxidase have been shown to be highly specific for the spectrum of vasculitic disorders that includes Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopical polyangiitis. Thus, although the finding of p-ANCA is not very useful diagnostically by itself, the combination of positive tests for p-ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase is very useful.When a patient has organ-threatening disease, as this patient had in her eye, aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is warranted, whether the disease is due to systemic lupus erythematosus or Wegener's granulomatosis.Dr. Schaller: From a rheumatologist's point of view, however, the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis differ. This girl needs very aggressive treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus, probably with a combination of drugs, and monitoring of the serum complement and double-stranded DNA antibody levels.Dr. Niles: I agree that monitoring the titers of serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus and ANCA titers will be very useful for the long-term management of her condition.Initially, the patient was treated with the intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone. Because of her age and strong desire to have more children, zidovudine (75 mg per day) was then given, with a slow tapering of prednisone to a low dose. Her condition improved considerably in the months after her hospitalization, with a marked increase in her vision. Her complement levels have become normal, and there has been a large decrease in her ANCA titer.\\n\",\n",
